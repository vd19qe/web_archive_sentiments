YouTube TV is available nationwide in the US and lets you watch live TV including local sports, news, shows, and more.

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording.

You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV.

To start your free trial, simply sign up online, make sure you have an internet connection and a supported device, and begin watching in minutes. Is YouTube TV easy to use? Ease of use, reliability, and quality are central to YouTube TV. We aim to provide an experience that is both intuitive and hassle-free. We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.) You won‚Äôt be able to access any programs on YouTube TV, live or recorded, while traveling internationally. Are there really no DVR storage space limits? You can record as many programs as you want at the same time, without ever running out of storage space. We‚Äôll even keep each recording for 9 months. Stream from your library anywhere in the US. Can I share my membership? Yes, your YouTube TV membership comes with 6 accounts to share with roommates or family members in your household. (Ages 13 and up.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

YouTube TV is available nationwide in the US and lets you watch live TV including local sports, news, shows, and more. To start your free trial, simply sign up online, make sure you have an internet connection and a supported device, and begin watching in minutes. Is YouTube TV easy to use?

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.) You won‚Äôt be able to access any programs on YouTube TV, live or recorded, while traveling internationally. Are there really no DVR storage space limits?

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program.

You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium?

YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads.

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program.

You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

To start your free trial, simply sign up online, make sure you have an internet connection and a supported device, and begin watching in minutes. Is YouTube TV easy to use? Ease of use, reliability, and quality are central to YouTube TV. We aim to provide an experience that is both intuitive and hassle-free. We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.) You won‚Äôt be able to access any programs on YouTube TV, live or recorded, while traveling internationally. Are there really no DVR storage space limits? You can record as many programs as you want at the same time, without ever running out of storage space. We‚Äôll even keep each recording for 9 months. Stream from your library anywhere in the US. Can I share my membership? Yes, your YouTube TV membership comes with 6 accounts to share with roommates or family members in your household. (Ages 13 and up.) Everyone gets their own login, personalized content recommendations, and individual DVR library. Up to 3 simultaneous streams are allowed per membership. What if I want to cancel? No problem, cancel anytime. There are no fees for canceling. We‚Äôd hate to see you go, but we‚Äôll save your settings in case you want to restart your membership later. If you‚Äôd like to take a break without losing recordings that you‚Äôve saved, you can also simply pause your membership for up to six months. Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium?

YouTube TV is available nationwide in the US and lets you watch live TV including local sports, news, shows, and more.

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

We recommend an internet connection of at least 3 Mbps for your viewing experience. With just a tap or word you can do things like: customize your live guide, record all episodes of your favorite show, or search for your favorite sports team. Can I watch YouTube TV while traveling? YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S., with live TV offered in areas where we‚Äôre launched. Your access to local networks will vary depending on which zip code you're in. Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program.

You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium?

YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads.

Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program.

If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV.

Sign in from home at least once every 3 months to keep your account active. (Note, you‚Äôll need to sign in from home monthly in order to stream MLB content.)

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. Which devices can I watch 4K quality video on? 4K playback is only available on compatible devices. 4K Ultra High Definition playback is available on select live and on-demand content in YouTube TV with our 4K Plus add-on. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads. More questions?

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads?

Additional programming and ads Are shows available on-demand? Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, as the live TV programming comes from networks related content creators, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your library. This means that all airings‚Äîincluding upcoming airings and reruns‚Äîwill be recorded automatically. You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand videos. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you‚Äôre not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. Which devices can I watch 4K quality video on? 4K playback is only available on compatible devices. 4K Ultra High Definition playback is available on select live and on-demand content in YouTube TV with our 4K Plus add-on. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn‚Äôt included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content (including YouTube Originals) on YouTube TV without ads. More questions?
