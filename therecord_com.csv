Employees who contacted The Record say about 150 team leaders at the North plant in Cambridge were called last week and told to report back to work this Thursday. Production at all North American Toyota manufacturing plants, including Cambridge and Woodstock, remains shut down, with a planned restart date of May 4 announced last week. Toyota has cited both safety concerns and a decline in vehicle demand as reasons for the shutdown that began almost a month ago. Workers say the tasks they're being asked to do are administrative in nature, likely looking at how output may be reduced once production resumes. ""Our biggest concern is the safety aspect,"" said Lee Sperduti, one of the team leaders (akin to a lead hand) being told to return. ""I want to be at work and I want to get paid, but I don't want to risk the health of my family, myself, and I don't want to risk the community."" It is believed three employees working in the Cambridge plant prior to the shutdown have tested positive for COVID-19. Toyota spokesperson Michael Boulaine said Wednesday that some essential work must be done to ensure the facility is functional and safe for employees when production resumes, adding that some team leaders and maintenance staff have been asked to return. Businesses that manufacture goods are considered essential workplaces by the province. ""As always, the safety of our employees is our top priority and we have many protocols in place to protect them,"" Boulaine wrote in an email. Those protocols include a temperature scan and wellness survey before employees enter the facility, providing a mask, enforcing strict social distancing guidelines, and increasing disinfection measures. Sperduti said workers had been told they'll receive personal protective equipment, but specifics were vague. ""We're really worried about the asymptomatic people who are coming in."" Another team leader, Brad Kapko, said he expects many of his coworkers won't go in on Thursday, amid an extended provincial state of emergency, prolonged school and daycare closures, and a looming risk of virus exposure. Workers refusing to go in may be punished and lose pay, even as others told to stay home during the shutdown are being paid, Kapko said in an email. ""I speak for many of us that this decision is not one we should be forced to make nor is it an easy one. ""The company's answers to our concern to this point has been that returning to work is mandatory for team leaders. Most of us agree that the work they want done could probably be done from home on our computers."" Sperduti said he's called several politicians and agencies seeking advice, and has generally been told to submit a work refusal if he doesn't feel safe. ""There's a lot of people that are very, very anxious,"" he said. ""All it takes is one person to infect everybody.""

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test.

""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test.

""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading...

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading...

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Operations will be suspended starting Thursday afternoon, with production expected to resume on Mon. April 6. A planned two-day shutdown for all North American Toyota automobile and components plants that was set to begin Monday was extended until April 6 ""due to the increasing social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in market demand, and our desire to protect the health and safety of our team members, dealers, suppliers and communities,"" a memo circulated to employees on Thursday afternoon stated. Service parts depots and vehicle logistics centres will continue to operate, the company said. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada added Friday's closure to extend the paid shutdown to 11 workdays. ""We believe this shutdown is right for Toyota at this time, and we will make additional adjustments as necessary,"" the memo said. The notice said some essential work may be necessary during the shutdown. ""If so, we may ask for your support and your manager will discuss options with you."" In an email, corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane added ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action in a timely manner."" On Thursday morning, the company confirmed that one of its employees from the plastics maintenance area at the Cambridge facility's North Plant has tested positive for the virus; the positive confirmation was made by public health officials in Hamilton as the person lives in that area. The employee's last shift was March 12, and has not been at the plant since. ""Our affected employee — as well as those identified as having had close contact with the individual — will remain in self-isolation and will not return to work until being cleared by a physician,""corporate communications manager Michael Bouliane said in an email. ""We have taken the added precaution of deep cleaning and disinfecting all areas in which the employees were working, and will continue to follow the guidance of public health authorities."" A memo circulated in the plant and sent to the Record states that 10 employees who had close contact with the person who tested positive will self-isolate. With rumours swirling through the plant Wednesday evening, employees were notified at about 11 p.m. of the confirmed test. Night shift workers from both the North and South plants were sent home at that point, and a memo to staff said the remainder of the shift would be paid. The memo indicated that maintenance and common areas in which the infected employee had worked — plastics maintenance — would be cleaned. Thursday morning shifts resumed as scheduled at the sprawling Cambridge facility. Roughly 8,500 people work at the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. Some employees had already been told to stay home in recent days with cold or flu-like symptoms, or because they'd been travelling. Late Wednesday afternoon, Toyota announced the two-day shutdown. Other major auto manufacturers have announced similar upcoming shutdowns at North American facilities. Region of Waterloo spokesperson Bryan Stortz said this confirmed case is not one of those confirmed by Waterloo Region public health. ""It's not related to any of our confirmed cases."" At a briefing Thursday, the region's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, said Hamilton public health officials are working to identify those who've had close contact with the employee and will provide local officials with that information. Waterloo Region public health will follow up with impacted residents here. Wang was asked if the plant should remain open in the wake of the positive test. ""It depends on the level of risk,"" she said. ""There isn't a broad recommendation to close workplaces as soon as there is a case."" The areas an individual worked in or frequented, or whether there's ongoing risk of exposure, are taken into account. In this case, Toyota would make a decision based on recommendations from public health officials in Hamilton, Wang said. More than a dozen Toyota workers had contacted the Record with concerns about whether it's safe for them to continue working. Most didn't want to be identified, fearing repercussions from the company. Steve Porter, who has worked at the Cambridge plant for two years, said he walked out just after the start of his Thursday morning shift because he didn't feel it was safe to be there. ""I'm a caregiver for my 84-year-old father,"" he said. ""Am I putting him at risk?"" Porter said he was told he'd have to take a personal day for leaving work. ""It's ludicrous. It's shameful,"" he said. ""The total disregard for people's health was just wrong."" Some workers have already chosen not to come in recent days, given public health and government recommendations to avoid large gatherings, to practice social distancing and to stay home as much as possible. Others who contacted the Record say they weren't going to report to work on Thursday night or Friday if the plants remained open. ""We're just at the start of what's happening in other jurisdictions,"" employee Lee Sperduti said Thursday. ""They're putting us in jeopardy."" The plant must be idled until the safety of everyone there can be guaranteed, he said. ""If they can't guarantee my safety, there's no way in hell I should be guaranteeing them profit."" bdavis@therecord.com Twitter: @DavisRecord cseto@therecord.com Twitter: @SetoRecord SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Record More from The Record & Partners More News Top Stories Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.
