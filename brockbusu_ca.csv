March 13, 2020 Dear Fellow Badgers, The COVID-19 virus has had a global impact, reaching countries far and wide, and affecting us all here at home. First and foremost, we would like to re-iterate that the Niagara Public Health Department has stated that the risk to Niagara residents of contracting the Coronavirus remains low. With that being said, Brock has suspended face-to-face classes and exams and is moving towards alternative forms of delivery. We encourage students to read the full statement and find future updates at https://brocku.ca/coronavirus/. Given the reduced activity on campus, BUSU operations will be affected. Please see below for some brief updates on the status of various BUSU businesses, services and initiatives: While BUSU will be operating at a reduced capacity, our main office will remain open, Monday-Friday, from 9am-5pm. All BUSU operated businesses (Isaac’s Bar and Grill, Union Station and General Brock) will be closed for the remainder of the academic term. All BUSU organized events for the remainder of the academic term will be cancelled. This includes St. Patrick’s Day at Isaac’s on March 17th, the Drag Show featuring Roxxxy Andrews on March 19th, Wellness Week and more. All BUSU club events for the remainder of the academic term will be cancelled. BUSU’s March elections will proceed digitally. Full election details can be found at www.brockbusu.ca/elections beginning on Monday, March 16th. Voting will take place via your Brock email from March 24th to 26th. BUSU’s Health and Dental Plan benefits will be unaffected. Full Health and Dental Plan details can be found here: www.brockbusu.ca/healthplan. Support for our Health and Dental Plan will shift from in-person to a digital format. If you have a question or concern regarding the BUSU Health Plan, please email Joanne Matko at [email protected] For specific Health and Dental Plan COVID-19 information, please visit this information site.

We recognize that this will be a difficult process for all of us – please remember that we are all in this together. In closing, we want to encourage everyone to take proactive steps to maintain good health and minimize transmission. At this point, most people know the basics: diligently washing your hands, sanitizing frequently touched surfaces or objects, sneezing/coughing into your elbow and self-isolating if you feel sick or show any common symptoms.

March 13, 2020 Dear Fellow Badgers, The COVID-19 virus has had a global impact, reaching countries far and wide, and affecting us all here at home. First and foremost, we would like to re-iterate that the Niagara Public Health Department has stated that the risk to Niagara residents of contracting the Coronavirus remains low. With that being said, Brock has suspended face-to-face classes and exams and is moving towards alternative forms of delivery. We encourage students to read the full statement and find future updates at https://brocku.ca/coronavirus/. Given the reduced activity on campus, BUSU operations will be affected. Please see below for some brief updates on the status of various BUSU businesses, services and initiatives: While BUSU will be operating at a reduced capacity, our main office will remain open, Monday-Friday, from 9am-5pm. All BUSU operated businesses (Isaac’s Bar and Grill, Union Station and General Brock) will be closed for the remainder of the academic term. All BUSU organized events for the remainder of the academic term will be cancelled. This includes St. Patrick’s Day at Isaac’s on March 17th, the Drag Show featuring Roxxxy Andrews on March 19th, Wellness Week and more. All BUSU club events for the remainder of the academic term will be cancelled. BUSU’s March elections will proceed digitally. Full election details can be found at www.brockbusu.ca/elections beginning on Monday, March 16th. Voting will take place via your Brock email from March 24th to 26th. BUSU’s Health and Dental Plan benefits will be unaffected. Full Health and Dental Plan details can be found here: www.brockbusu.ca/healthplan. Support for our Health and Dental Plan will shift from in-person to a digital format. If you have a question or concern regarding the BUSU Health Plan, please email Joanne Matko at [email protected] For specific Health and Dental Plan COVID-19 information, please visit this information site. Any changes in public transit to Brock will be shared with you by the transit providers and BUSU. BUSU’s Food First program will remain in operation, and requests can be submitted online at www.brockbusu.ca/food-first. Requests will be reviewed on Wednesdays and Fridays, and upon approval, grocery store gift cards will be available for pickup at the BUSU office. For further BUSU updates, please monitor our social media channels (@BrockBUSU) or visit our online home for updates: www.brockbusu.ca/covid While we apologize to all of our students that our operations are affected, we do want to express our gratitude to Brock University, and the Provincial and Federal Governments for taking proactive steps to flatten the curve and reduce the COVID-19 spread. We recognize that this will be a difficult process for all of us – please remember that we are all in this together. In closing, we want to encourage everyone to take proactive steps to maintain good health and minimize transmission. At this point, most people know the basics: diligently washing your hands, sanitizing frequently touched surfaces or objects, sneezing/coughing into your elbow and self-isolating if you feel sick or show any common symptoms. We also encourage students who choose to celebrate this St. Patrick’s Day to do so responsibly by avoiding large gatherings and confined spaces, avoid handshakes and minimize other physical contact, and do not share drinks, vapes, cigarettes, etc. Each of our actions has an impact on those around us and to our community as a whole.
