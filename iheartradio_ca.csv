The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Wainfleet stepping up by-law enforcement Wainfleet is cracking down on by-law disrespect.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Wainfleet stepping up by-law enforcement Wainfleet is cracking down on by-law disrespect.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry.""

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry.""

It’s a move that makes sense from a public health perspective but it’s not what students signed up for; so many are reconsidering whether they’ll attend, many saying they’ll opt for a gap year – preferring to have the full campus experience rather than a virtual gathering. Anna-Marie Musson from Musson Law says, the COVID Cohort is creating a whole new set of unexpected challenges and pressures for couples and families trying to navigate Family Law in this country. Keeping the Courts on Track during the COVID pandemic We have constantly talked about how we must re-invent, re-think, re-calibrate our economy, our personal and professional lives and our long-standing institutions as we respond to the COVID pandemic. Healthcare and education have been front a centre for most families across the country. But the justice system may have faced the greatest challenges, forced to comply with the public health requirements while ensuring the courts continued to function. John McMahon is a Superior Court Justice in Ontario and he has been tasked to lead the province’s criminal court through the challenges and changes facing the system… Taking Canada's pulse during the pandemic. How do we view the Next Normal? I was meeting with a friend over coffee at a local Starbucks the day the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. It’s been more than 100 days since that happened. Needless to say, all of our jobs, our families, our homes have been disrupted when the pandemic forced a global economic shutdown. So, how have we coped so far? How have our values been re-shaped and re-focused? John Wright is a veteran pollster and a principal at DART Insights and Communications. He’s been taking the Canadian pulse during this pandemic. He joins us from his home office in Toronto. Is the COVID-19 pandemic an Apollo 13 moment for the science community? We spent the first three months of the pandemic saying we need to trust the science and scientists. But we've also seen a good deal of frustration around mixed messages - Lancet withdrawing the hydroxychloriquine research, and the WHO taking its ""learning as we go"" approach to this novel coronavirus. Two things have happened. We have a better understanding of how the science community functions. On the other hand, it lays bare the fallibility of science and gives the critics/conspiracy theorists more ammunition. Transparency is good but it shows errors on full display. So, how or will this change the way the science community conducts itself in the post Covid era? Is this pandemic its Apollo 13 moment? Dan Riskin is CTV’s Senior Science Correspondent and a professor of Biology at the University of Toronto Will consumers push corporations to place purpose over profit in the post COVID world? Economies are re-opening across Canada and around the world as we emerge from the first wave of the COVID pandemic. Some regions are opening more slowly than others, primarily because of the number of active coronavirus cases still being reported. While this has proven to be a balance between public health and the need to reignite business on main street and Bay Street, the real success is going to depend on individual behaviours. How will consumers respond? How will you feel about going into a restaurant or a retailer? Marketing strategist Tony Chapman at Tony Chapman Reactions and host of the podcast CHATTER THAN MATTERS says marketers will have to consumer confidence and consumer comfort if they’re going to succeed in the post COVID era. Has the COVID pandemic accelerated the end of the American Century? Has COVID 19 contributed to the rage and rallying we’ve seen in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis? Has COVID-19 accelerated the end to what’s been called The American Century? David Schultz is a professor of political science and constitutional law at Hamline University in Minnesota. It’s his view that the pandemic has made it clear that America’s global influence is in decline while other nations are in their ascendancy. 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 On Air with NewsTalk 610 CKTB ALL SHOWS For our full schedule► CLICK HERE Niagara in the Morning with Tim Denis The Tom McConnell Show Matt Holmes TED Radio Hour LATEST AUDIO For all of the latest NewsTalk 610 CKTB Audio ► CLICK HERE Employment Lawyer Howard Levitt on Uber case going forward Criminal Defense Lawyer, Ari Goldkind African and Caribbean Culture Webinar Too Much Screen Time for Kids?

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. 50/50 draw in support of Community Care a big success and the winner is well-known to the agency A 50/50 draw in support of Community Care St. Catharines/Thorold was a major success.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce President Mishka Balsom says they would like to see the federal governments on both sides consider a regional approach to reopening the border. Balsom points to Europe as an example which is starting to reopen borders between countries. She says we can learn from them because they are ahead of us in dealing with the pandemic.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Hamilton joins growing list of municipalities to require masks for indoor spaces.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

Balsom points to Europe as an example which is starting to reopen borders between countries. She says we can learn from them because they are ahead of us in dealing with the pandemic.

Living in the COVID Era - THE NEXT NORMAL Subscribe to the podcast on iHeartRadio Brands and business will have to appeal to our cave dweller instincts in order to succeed in the COVID era We began this podcast series by exploring the behavioural and perceptual effects this pandemic has had on us and what will be the lasting impact. We learned that changes will actually come slowly, but the changes will be long lasting – perhaps even generational. We’ve learned that the future of work is no longer about working from home. It’s now about living at work. We’ve learned that our behaviour drives outcomes. Physical distancing, wearing masks, sneezing into our elbows are behviours that determine whether we’re fighting the curve, flattening the curve or crushing the curve. We’ve also learned that our expectations of government and corporations are framed by their behaviour. How have our leaders responded to your needs? How have corporations and brands addressed my concerns about your safety and your well-being? How has COVID-19 changed the language of business and brands? How has it moved the messaging? Graeme Newell is President of 602 Communications and an expert in DECISION SCIENCE. He joins us from his studio in Portland, Oregon. He says things haven't really changed. In fact, we've simply reverted to a more primitive, instinctive means of communication. See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. Early tests of an Austrlian vaccine show no side-effects in humans. Part 2 with Nikolai Petrovsky We know there will be a second wave of COVID-19. And it’s likely to hit us before the end of this calendar year. We also know that some countries, like Canada, have managed to crush the curve. Still, there are regions of the world where the curve continues to rise – particularly in Brazil, India and the United States. So, the daily news can be exhausting at best and grim when we consider the worst case scenarios. But there is some reason for optimism. Four months into the pandemic and more than 6 months after this strain of the coronavirus was first detected in China, the World Health Organization says there are currently 147 COVID-19 vaccines in development. At least 17 are now into the human trial phase. One of them is being developed in Australia. Professor Nikolai Petrovsky is the Chairman of the company called VAXINE Pty. He says their results to date are more than promising. See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. Promising news on the vaccine front. Part 1 with Nikolai Petrovsky, Chairman of Vaxine Pty. Some good news, if not great news, on the research front. There are 147 COVID-19 vaccines in development and 17 of them are into the human trials. Professor Nikolai Petrovsky is the chairman of VAXINE – an Australian based company that is undertaking an international effort to develop a COVID 19 vaccine. He and his team started human trials on July 1st, 2020 See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. It's not a cure but it may help you survive COVID-19. A Halifax firm is working on a preventative pill. The past few episodes of the NEXT NORMAL have focused on the SECOND WAVE of the COVID pandemic – likely to hit us in the next 4 of 5 months. While there’s still a lot we don’t know about this strain of the coronavirus, we have learned a lot since it was detected in December of last year. Much of that knowledge has come from an historic and piercing international scientific focus on COVID-19. There are hundreds of efforts underway to develop a vaccine and we know that some are well on their way towards human trials. But there has also been a great deal of research being done on pharmaceutical treatments that don’t immunize us but could help mitigate and minimize the symptoms and effects of COVID-19. A Halifax-based firm is doing just that. Appili Therapeutics is an infectious disease company that tests drugs currently in use to fight other diseases to see if they have any effect on COVID-19. It sounds like they’ve found one. Dr. Armand Balboni is the CEO of Appili Therapeutics. He says they are moving into phase two of trials to evaluate the drug called favipiravir as a preventative treatment against the coronavirus. And they are targeting a very specific – at risk demographic. See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. What have we learned to help prepare us for the Second Wave of COVID-19? Economies are in various stages of reopening across the country. But we do so with one eye on the SECOND WAVE which is expected to hit in the late autumn and last into the winter of 2021. Are we ready for it. We’ve been asking that question of late from a number of perspectives. In this episode, we look at some of the science lessons and medical lessons we’ve learned during the course of the pandemic so far. We talk to Dr. Mitch Shulman, and emergency medicine specialist in Montreal and the medical correspondent for iHeart Radio Canada, and our iHeart Radio Canada Science correspondent Professor Dan Riskin to get some clarity on whether we're seeing the start of the second wave already. See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. Are our frontline healthcare workers prepared for the second wave of the pandemic? We often talk about the heroes of the pandemic and that brings our front line healthcare workers to mind almost immediately. What does the Next Normal look like for them as we approach the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19? What the learnings they have had as they've faced down the COVID crisis? Tim Guest is President of the Canadian Nurses Association. See omnystudio.com/policies/listener for privacy information. How do we prepare for a spike in mental illnesses that are sure to come during the pandemic? Mark Henick is a Mental Health advocate and host of the podcast So Called Normal. There are some voices and expert thinkers among us who believe the ""second wave"" of the coronavirus pandemic may not be as severe as we had originally expected. But they do say it's coming and with it we will begin to see the true fallout of the ""first wave"" - the businesses that have gone bankrupt, the real job loss once government programs run out. And all of that will add up to an echo pandemic of mental illness. Are we prepared? Can we prepare?

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

People won't be accessing the building. Our housing clients can come to the back door as well - we have a table set up for them where staff will meet with them."" Souter adds they are also changing donation protocols. ""We're going to have to suspend the donation of household goods and clothing, focusing on the most important piece right now which is food security and the funds to help us get there. We don't know how long this is going to go on and if we're running out of particular supplies, having the ability to go and purchase is really helpful. So donations of food and funds are our focus right now."" Community Care has also stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing high traffic areas.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. 7 cases of E. coli traced to Valen's Lake Conservation Area in Hamilton Hamilton Public Health is responding to an E. coli outbreak at Valens Lake Conservation Area.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

We don't know how long this is going to go on and if we're running out of particular supplies, having the ability to go and purchase is really helpful. So donations of food and funds are our focus right now."" Community Care has also stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing high traffic areas.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. St. Catharines residents urged to follow COVID procedures as hard-hit areas face new restrictions ""...we're not going to be like Peel, Toronto, and Ottawa.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The politicians say the sector directly accounts for 13% of all jobs in Niagara. Niagara Falls MPP Wayne Gates, St. Catharines MPP Jennie Stevens, and Niagara Centre MPP Jeff Burch writing a letter to Premier Ford saying while new dining restrictions are being put into place in Niagara tomorrow, businesses need help to avoid bankruptcies or closures. Starting this weekend Niagara Public Health is putting new rules into effect limiting the people you sit with to members of your own household or essential caregivers at bars, restaurants, wineries, breweries and banquet halls. The Ontario government will move Niagara into the 'orange-restrict' level as of Monday November 16th, limiting dining to four people per table - down from the previous six. The orange level also means establishments can't serve alcohol after 9 p.m. and must close at 10 p.m. There is also a capacity limit of 50 people indoors. Here is the letter: Doug Ford, Premier Premier's Office Room 281 Legislative Building, Queen's Park Premier Ford, We are writing to you today to request that the Province provide immediate financial support for Niagara’s restaurants and bars which directly account for 13% of all jobs in Niagara, which does not include the ancillary benefits of this sector to our entertainment and agricultural sectors. As you know, our Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, initiated a new dining policy for restaurants and bars in Niagara using his powers under Section 22 of Ontario’s Health Protection and Promotion Act. The new policy stipulates that patrons may only dine with members of their household or persons essential to maintaining physical and mental health. Given our reliance on Dr. Hirji’s expertise and insight during these very difficult times we feel that any such decision was made by him through very careful and thoughtful consideration. While Dr. Hirji does have jurisdiction over health matters, he does not have the ability to provide financial relief for the businesses who may suffer because of this policy designed to halt the alarming and rapid spread of COVID-19 in Niagara. As the Premier of Ontario, you do have the ability to provide the financial relief these businesses needed to ensure this policy is as effective as possible without causing any bankruptcies or closures. Given that this policy solely applies to Niagara right now, we are asking for you to immediately act and provide specific relief for Niagara based businesses who are doing their part to address this crisis and abiding by these measures. Specifically, we are requesting immediate financial support for any restaurant affected by this public health decision to ensure that there are no layoffs, no foreclosures and no mountains of debt which become insurmountable. The closure of these restaurants and subsequent job losses would be devastating to our Region and cannot be accepted. You must act now to protect these business owners and employees who are doing their very best to ensure guests are as safe as possible. We cannot express enough how scared business owners are during this period. Most of them have done their very best to be part of the massive community effort to stop COVID-19. We are requesting that you act, as Dr. Hirji did, to provide an immediate subsidy to ensure that while this public health order is in effect that no Niagara restaurant or bar owner face financial hardship. If you require any help whatsoever in this, please do not hesitate to reach out. We have many restaurants who feel they cannot survive without considerable help and if you would like to speak with them directly we would be happy to facilitate those discussions.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector.

People won't be accessing the building. Our housing clients can come to the back door as well - we have a table set up for them where staff will meet with them."" Souter adds they are also changing donation protocols. ""We're going to have to suspend the donation of household goods and clothing, focusing on the most important piece right now which is food security and the funds to help us get there. We don't know how long this is going to go on and if we're running out of particular supplies, having the ability to go and purchase is really helpful. So donations of food and funds are our focus right now."" Community Care has also stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing high traffic areas.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Stay-at-home order expires on Tuesday, so when will the economy reopen in Ontario?

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. BREAKING | Hamilton reopening in 'Red' on Tuesday. What does that mean?

Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce President Mishka Balsom says they would like to see the federal governments on both sides consider a regional approach to reopening the border. Balsom points to Europe as an example which is starting to reopen borders between countries. She says we can learn from them because they are ahead of us in dealing with the pandemic. The GNCC chief notes the border closure has been devastating for tourism operators as well as some businesses that have been unable to get stock because of interruptions to the supply chain.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Extra weeks to be added to COVID-19 benefits for workers, parents, Trudeau says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government is adding 12 weeks of eligibility to two key benefits for unemployed workers and parents at home with children.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Having a hard time booking a campsite in Ontario?

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. $10.5 million to help build 41 new affordable homes in Niagara The Federal government announcing an investment in affordable housing in Niagara as part of the Rapid Housing Initiative Niagara businesses welcome early move to Step 3 Mishka Balsom, CEO with the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, says this is a good thing for Niagara Business, ""thrilled to hear about today's announcement and it's good for business, it's good for individuals, and it's good for employees.""

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. 8 projects at farms in Niagara West get $66,000 in funding Eight farm projects across Niagara are getting a boost from the Ontario government.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. 21 new cases of COVID in Niagara, five people being treated in hospital 21 new COVID-19 cases have been reported in Niagara.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for. Ontario legislature has been prorogued until after the federal election.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.

The federal government is offering $252 million in relief, mainly for workers at processing plants and farmers and growers facing decreased demands for livestock and crops as restaurants serve fewer people. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce's Director of Policy and Government Relations Hugo Chesshire welcomed the announcement, but says there are still local concerns. ""There's been a lot of uncertainty. First it was the uncertainty about the migrant workers, whether or not they'd be allowed in. And then that was cleared up and there'd be a 14 day delay, which obviously costs them as well. They don't come in on a certain date in order to take a vacation, they come in on a certain date because they need to start working right away. So that 14 day delay is costly."" Chesshire points out in terms of population quotient, Niagara has one of the biggest agricultural sectors in the province, chiefly in tender fruit. During yesterday's announcement, Prime Minister Trudeau promised more help would be coming for the industry. GNCC President Mishka Balsom echoes that sentiment. ""It's a temporary approach to it, but it's definitely not the full support of the sector. I think we're hearing from a number of ministers too that there are more announcements in the weeks to come for this industry."" The latest funding falls well below the $2.6 billion the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was hoping for.
