The findings debunk notions that most babies are protected for much of their first year by maternal antibodies passed on through pregnancy. In fact, Toronto researchers from the Hospital for Sick Children and Public Health Ontario say the vast majority of 196 infants they studied were susceptible by three months of age. And none of the infants were immune at six months. Babies typically don't receive the measles vaccine until they are 12 months old. That results in a wide susceptibility gap that the study's senior author called ""quite alarming."" Shelly Bolotin, a scientist at Public Health Ontario, said the findings underscore the need for everyone to keep their immunization up-to-date to protect the most vulnerable members of the population. ""This is really troubling because measles is a serious disease, and it can be quite serious in infants,"" said Bolotin, also an assistant professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and the Department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology at the University of Toronto. ""It can be absolutely devastating and we need to make sure that we are protecting our most vulnerable members of our population - infants."" The study was published online Thursday and appears in the December edition of the American Academy of Pediatrics journal, Pediatrics. It found that 20 per cent of one-month-old infants had antibody levels below the protective threshold and 92 per cent of three-month-old babies has levels below the threshold. Bolotin said researchers already knew infant immunity declines in the first six months of life, but they did not expect such a rapid drop. ""We were surprised to see that waning or that lack of protection start earlier,"" said Bolotin, who collaborated with lead author Dr. Michelle Science, infectious disease specialist at Sick Kids and also an infection control physician at Public Health Ontario. She said the assumption that babies are protected longer is based on studies conducted in places where measles remains prevalent. In those regions, mothers have more robust antibody levels to pass on to their child because their immunity comes through natural infection and is repeatedly boosted by continual exposure to measles. In contrast, most Canadian women of child-bearing age are immune through vaccination because Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Although vaccination rates are high here, immunization through vaccine is associated with lower antibody levels than natural infection. Bolotin said the Toronto study is unique in measuring antibodies at each month of an infant's life from birth to 12 months. Previous research has focused on measuring immunity levels among babies at birth or those older than six months. A companion paper written by two other experts that also appears in Pediatrics raises the question of whether it's time to consider changing the vaccine schedule. It concludes there's no reason to vaccinate earlier, despite ongoing outbreaks in the United States. Bolotin acknowledged this is a challenging question for policy-makers who must weigh the risk of infection against the best time to vaccinate children, whose immunity system is still maturing. Infants between six and 11 months who travel to regions where measles is endemic are encouraged to receive an early dose of the vaccine in addition to their regular 12-month dose, but otherwise, all provinces in Canada recommend the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) at 12 months of age. The schedule for a second dose of the vaccine varies across the country. The Pediatrics commentary suggested early vaccination may actually hinder the efficacy of a later dose, resulting in lower levels of the antibody compared with children who first get the vaccine at 12 months.

As of late last week, Bolotin said Canada has seen 112 cases of measles this year, the vast majority of them imported or import-related. Measles can cause severe complications including pneumonia, encephalitis and death.

Experts say doctors need to do more in response. By Chicago Tribune Thu., Feb. 20, 2020timer4 min. read CHICAGO - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and U.S. health experts are working to better understand why so many moms are dying. But many women might be unaware of their heart risks while pregnant - and the importance of taking steps to improve heart health is becoming clearer in light of a new study. On Monday, Northwestern Medicine researchers published what they say is the first study to examine the cardiovascular health of pregnant women in the United States. Using 15 years of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Journal of the American Heart Association article analyzed records of 1,117 pregnant and 8,200 nonpregnant women, assessing key factors including diet, exercise and blood pressure. Among pregnant women, the study found 4.6 per cent had high cardiovascular health, 61 per cent had moderate cardiovascular health and 35 per cent had low cardiovascular health. Younger women and African Americans were most affected. Such figures mean doctors need to do more to assess the heart health of pregnant patients, said James Martin, chair of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Pregnancy and Heart Disease Task Force. ""We must think of heart disease as a possibility in every pregnant or postpartum patient we see, to detect and treat at-risk mothers,"" Martin said in a statement. Black women are particularly at risk while pregnant; in Illinois, they were six times more likely to die from pregnancy-related conditions, according to a 2018 review of cases. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, while recommending in 2019 that all women be assessed for heart disease while pregnant, noted black women's risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was 3.4 times higher than that of white women, a disparity it attributed in part to racial bias and racism in the health care system. During pregnancy, the heart works harder and pumps more blood, which can reveal underlying heart issues or lead to conditions like a heart attack, chest pain or stroke. Some patients already know they have issues like congenital heart disease, but many others develop problems while pregnant. ""Sometimes women don't know they have heart disease, and because of these changes in pregnancy, lo and behold, they start having problems,"" said Marla Mendelson, medical director of Northwestern Medicine's Heart Disease and Pregnancy Program at the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute, which includes maternal-fetal medicine, anesthesia and obstetrics specialists. It's not only an important time for the baby's health, but also for the mother's health after birth, said Amanda Marma Perak, preventive cardiologist at Lurie Children's Hospital. ""A lot of women don't know, and far too many women neglect their heart health,"" Perak said. In Illinois, 22 per cent of 140 maternal deaths studied from 2002 to 2011 were related to cardiovascular disease, according to a 2019 article in the American Heart Association's journal ""Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes."" The state's 2018 maternal mortality review included several examples of women with cardiac conditions. Despite these risks, heart issues among women are still not fully understood. In part, this is because of a lack of research; it can be difficult to study pregnancy, which includes many changes in the body. But, Perak said, it is not impossible. ""Obviously it is a really important time,"" Perak said. ""I think we're improving in our knowledge of it, but we still have a long way to go."" Cardiologists are only now beginning to realize their role in assessing heart health during pregnancy, said Nandita Scott, a cardiologist and co-director of the Corrigan Women's Heart Health Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Cardiologists do not get extensive training regarding pregnancy - Scott said she didn't receive much - and only recently has the field of cardio-obstetrics emerged. The American Heart Association recommends creating more cardio-obstetrics teams, which could include experts from cardiology, obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, anesthesia and nursing. In 2018, the American Heart Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a joint advisory stressing the need for medical providers to team up to better identify heart risks. A number of factors impact heart health among pregnant women. Patients with diabetes or high blood pressure can be at higher risk; other factors include being overweight, getting pregnant later in life or having a multiple gestation pregnancy. The risk does not end after childbirth. Women can be vulnerable for weeks, and even months, after giving birth. Patients with hypertension during pregnancy, for example, should continue to have their blood pressure monitored, Mendelson said. The six weeks following childbirth is a high-risk time for complications, but many women don't see their doctor during that time. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended earlier followup visits, and health experts also say home visits by a nurse after birth can make it easier to spot and assess issues for both mom and baby. For patients with hypertensive disorders or heart disease, a followup with a provider within 14 days is recommended. ""Also, realize that you need to advocate for yourself,"" Scott said of mothers, noting that even tennis star Serena Williams said she had to alert doctors when something felt off, ultimately revealing blood clots in her lungs after her daughter was born in 2017.

Plan a heart-healthy diet: lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like fish and low-fat dairy. Limit processed foods like soda and packaged snacks, which have a lot of sugar and salt. Talk to your doctor about exercise, which is often safe and beneficial. Even a brisk walk for 20 or 30 minutes can get your heart rate up. And know the symptoms of heart issues. ""The things that we really watch out for: difficulty breathing when lying down; any type of chest pain should be evaluated; rapid heart rate,"" Mendelson said. ""These are signs that there may be a problem.""

The Social Determinants of Health in COVID-19 report found visible minorities account for nearly 51 per cent of cases despite making up only 19 per cent of Hamilton’s population. Of those the Black community was most affected. “It’s important to point out that although 14 per cent of our cases identify as Black, about four per cent of our community identifies as Black,” Mackenzie Slifierz, epidemiologist for the city, said when the report was presented to the board of health on Monday. “There is a disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the community that identifies as Black.” In addition, 27 per cent of cases are those living in low-income households even though they account for 19 per cent of the population. “Our visible minority cases were three times more likely to live in low-income households,” said Slifierz. Adding to their vulnerability was that average household size was larger for visible minority COVID-19 cases. “That has been ... hypothesized to be perhaps be one of the components around why there might be some disproportionate activity of COVID in our visible minority population,” said Silfierz. But the report only had a 64 per cent response rate overall — 630 people out of 992 infected in Hamilton from March 1 to Aug. 31 answered at least one social determinant question. Not all questions were answered equally with some having far fewer responses. “We did have quite a lower response rate for the income question,” said Slifierz. “People were less willing to provide their income.” The analysis is also based off of those tested for COVID, which means a significant number of cases are likely missing. Public Health Ontario estimates cases are four times higher than reported from March to June, said Slifierz. “We know that not every single COVID case in our community is captured in our surveillance data,” he said. “Not everyone goes to get tested. Some people don’t seek that out.” The worry is that those most likely to be hit hardest by COVID are also those facing the biggest barriers to get tested. “It’s definitely a challenge,” said Dr. Elizabeth Richardson at the city’s COVID-19 response update Monday. “When we’re talking about health-equity issues and social determinants, it can be very much the access to testing that is part of the challenge, so we don’t get anything reported from those groups.” She said public health has made efforts to reach out to higher-risk communities. “We’ve been offering mobile testing so that we can ensure those who have a difficult time getting to an assessment centre can get tested,” she said. “We’ve been trying as much as we can to increase the availability and accessibility of testing.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... There is also a concern that the most-affected communities are less likely to answer questions on social determinants. “We know this is very much a delicate area, it’s kind of new for many people for us to be asking these kinds of questions,” said Richardson. “But I think over time that comfort is likely to increase as this becomes more clear ... that we’re doing it to help those groups, to understand what their challenges are and how we can help them.” The city didn’t start routinely collecting data on social determinants until May 26. “The province had indicated they were going to look at getting a standardized questionnaire which we waited for but since it wasn’t coming we adapted what our colleagues had done,” Richardson told the board.

Is this the dreaded coronavirus? By Sheryl NadlerContributing Columnist Tue., March 10, 2020timer3 min. read On Sunday morning I woke up with the sniffles. Ermahgawd I've got it, I thought. The dreaded coronavirus. It's finally here. What do I do? Do I present to an ER with a severe case of the sniffles? Will the ER be packed with hundreds of others who also awoke with the sniffles? How do I know that these sniffles and scratchy throat are the common cold and not the dreaded coronavirus? Which, of course begs the question, how many people are walking around with the coronavirus who think they just have the sniffles? And how concerned should we be? (For those of you who are new to this space, you should know that I am one-part hypochondriac. That part being about half.) Now convinced I had contracted the dreaded virus based on the evidence at hand (runny nose, scratchy throat), I avoided kissing my dog who ambled over for her morning snuggle. The cats? Yeah, they don't care. But the dog, well, the dog will eventually be sad at this uncharacteristic lack of affection. Even sadder if we all have to be quarantined for 14 days. Will she have to wear a face mask like those dogs in Shanghai? Do we even sell mini face masks in Hamilton? And why didn't I think to get toilet paper last week before pandemic hysteria set in? Despite all this, it was still a beautiful Sunday morning and I was scheduled to meet a friend at the Rail Trail for a nature walk. You know, forest bathing to soothe the mind, body, soul, all that good stuff. I guessed I should still go. I was clearly a bit frazzled and could use some soul-soothing. And anyway, I'm sure she won't contract it from me since this is mostly in my head, I told myself. So, I popped half an allergy pill and some vitamin D and headed out to meet her. I revealed my suspected condition upon our greeting. Uh-huh, she responded, unalarmed. And so, we headed out, sharing how this time last week we might have rolled our eyes at supposed coronavirus hysteria, but this week, after pretty much every scientist in the world told every media outlet in the world that this is the real deal, well, it's a whole different story. Damn, I really should have bought toilet paper last week. By the end of our 2.5-hour trek through the forest, my sniffles had all but disappeared. And except for some leg wobbles from having negotiated ice and snow the whole time, I felt pretty good. Maybe I'm not dying after all, I thought. Maybe I should just remember to regularly take my allergy pills. I popped into the nearby grocery store to pick up a few things for the week and crossed my fingers that the shelves wouldn't be bare. After all, I'd been reading all weekend about how Armageddon had basically set in, people setting up panic rooms stocked with canned goods and toilet paper in case we all have to be barricaded inside our homes. We can't count on grocery deliveries if no one can leave their homes. But there, in the Fortinos, I realized that everything seemed same OK. The toilet paper was stocked, there didn't appear to be a run on anything from what I could tell. I mean, despite reports that global supply chains and stock markets might be and have been affected by this pandemic. But from where I was standing, in front of the chocolate covered Easter eggs, of course, nothing seemed amiss. So, I gathered up some essentials for the week in case of a worst-case scenario: chocolate-covered almonds, couscous and tomato salad …. you know, important stuff. And I hoped for the best. And as I left I thought, darn. I should have stocked up on Kleenex, too.

Calgary-based WestJet Airlines Ltd. said Wednesday that it has taken immediate measures to mitigate ""dramatic"" effects on its operations, including freezing hiring and discretionary spending as well as offering voluntary departure packages to employees among its roughly 14,000 member workforce. The company in a statement said it would not speculate on additional steps that may be needed in a rapidly changing environment. Ed Sims, WestJet president and CEO in a memo to employees, said decreased travel demand means the airline will be looking at suspending flights and routes amounting to at least 12 per cent of its capacity, with reductions possibly including domestic, transatlantic and sun destinations as well as flights to the U.S. Carriers stateside including Delta and American Airlines have already made similar moves, while WestJet is determining whether changes will be made to its plan to begin service to Rome on May 2. Air Canada, meanwhile, said it is cancelling an order for 11 Boeing 737 Max aircraft amid concerns about the safety of the grounded jet, adding that it has cut back on a 2013 deal to buy 61 of the beleaguered planes, reducing the total to 50. Canada and countries around the world grounded the 737 Max last year following two crashes in five months that killed all 346 people on board, including 18 Canadians. A spokesperson for the airline, which has suspended daily flights to Rome, Beijing and Shanghai and cut back on routes to Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Seoul, would not comment on financial and traffic results outside of quarterly reporting periods. Air Canada is to report first quarter results in May. National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen forecasts that the epidemic will cost Canada's largest airline $1.4 billion in adjusted earnings this year, which would result in a 40 per cent decline from 2019. Air Canada in its fourth quarter report in February said it is bracing for a rough first quarter on impacts of novel coronavirus and the grounding of its fleet of 737 Max jets. The dual blows mean adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2020 are expected to generate about $200 million less than a year earlier, or about one-third lower than the $583 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first three months of 2019, the company said. Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa is preparing a response to the COVID-19 situation as it impacts airlines, adding that she spoke with the CEO's of Air Canada and WestJet on Monday to gather information on the carriers' circumstances.

Jean-Pierre Fortin, the national president of the Customs and Immigration Union, told the Star Wednesday that his members' immediate concern is more support from Health Canada at the country's major airports — including Toronto's Pearson International. But Fortin said there are currently no Health Canada officials at major land crossings, and the government is reviewing its land border crossing policies as Canada's closest neighbour struggles to contain the virus. ""At airports, our folks are wearing gloves, they're wearing the N-95 masks, they're wearing also glasses to protect themselves. But these measures are not in place at land borders at this time,"" Fortin said. Fortin said the spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. ""puts more pressure"" on his members. ""They're watching the news like anyone else,"" Fortin said. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) had already put in place ""enhanced"" screening for travellers crossing at land, rail or ferry on March 5 — for instance, referring those who recently travelled to Iran or who are ill for additional screening. The CBSA refused to confirm it is reviewing policies regarding land border crossings, referring questions to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The health authority did not respond to specific questions. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, who is responsible for CBSA, did not immediately provide comment. But in a morning press conference Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that with hundreds of thousands of people crossing the border every day, the U.S. is ""a real potential vector of transmission."" ""We continue to engage extremely regularly with our counterparts in the United States to ensure that we are handling as best we can the spread of this virus,"" Trudeau told reporters in the National Press Theatre. ""We will continue to monitor, to co-ordinate to ensure that what we are doing has as minimal impact both on Canadians' health but also on the growth of our economy (as possible)."" The Trump administration has faced criticism over its handling of COVID-19 testing and treatment, with the president himself repeatedly seeming to downplay the significance of what the World Health Organization now calls a pandemic. As of Sunday evening 34 states, as well as New York City and Washington D.C., had reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC said more than half of those cases were in California and Washington. On Tuesday, Michigan— which shares one of the busiest border crossing points with Canada — declared a state of emergency despite only having two confirmed cases. But those numbers are expected to rise dramatically as the virus spreads. ""It's fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time either this year or next be exposed to this virus and there's a good chance many will become sick,"" said Nancy Messonnier, the director of CDC's immunization and respiratory disease centre, in a Tuesday press conference. In a statement, CBSA said they have already stepped up screening at land ports of entry, including the ""identification and interception"" of travellers who recently visited coronavirus hot spots. ""Enhanced measures are being implement … based on the evolution of COVID-19 and the increasing number of cases occurring outside of mainland China as well as recognizing that a number of travellers who eventually seek entry into Canada arrive in the U.S. first, initially,"" the agency said in a statement. Fortin, whose union represents more than 10,000 border officials, said his members would like to see increased support at Canada's major airports.

Trudeau himself is now working from home, after the first ministers' summit slated to begin Thursday in Ottawa was cancelled in the face of the pandemic. In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said Trudeau has no symptoms of illness and is choosing to self-isolate ""out of an abundance of caution."" The release said Sophie Grégoire Trudeau started exhibiting ""flu-like symptoms"" late Wednesday night, after she recently returned from a speaking engagement in the United Kingdom. She ""immediately sought medical advice"", but was feeling better Thursday morning, the PMO said. Trudeau will also stay in isolation for 14 days. He will address Canadians about the outbreak Friday morning and his office says he plans to continue to carry out duties from isolation. Gregoire was in London for a WE Day event on March 4, where she was a featured speaker. Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, and daughter Ella-Grace were also travelling with the prime minister's wife, according to her Instagram posts. Trudeau took to social media to deliver the news himself, writing on Twitter that he is monitoring for any signs of illness while he awaits his wife's COVID-19 test results. ""I'll be busy working from home. Today, I'll be speaking with some world leaders and joining ministers for a cabinet committee discussion on COVID-19,"" he wrote. Moments after the stunning news that Trudeau and his wife are in self-isolation, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh revealed he, too, is ""feeling unwell"" and staying at home. In a post on Twitter, Singh said he has been in contact with a doctor and does not believe he has contracted COVID-19. ""But their advice is for me to limit contact with the public until I am feeling better,"" he said. ""All of us come into contact with many people who may be vulnerable to illness — we have to make sure we are taking measures to limit the chance that we infect them."" Seamus O'Regan, the federal natural resources minister, is also self-isolating this week after attending an international mining conference in Toronto, where Ontario health officials confirmed a man from Sudbury contracted the virus in the first instance of transmission within the province. O'Regan wrote on Twitter Wednesday that he had ""possible symptoms"" after attending the conference, ""which is why I was tested and then told to self-isolate."" Liberal MP Anthony Housefather told the Star's Susan Delacourt this week that he is also staying at home ""out of an abundance of caution"" after he attended a pro-Israeli policy conference in Washington, D.C., where attendees reportedly tested positive for the virus after leaving the event. This week's first ministers meeting, scheduled to take place in Ottawa, came as all levels of government grappled with the coronavirus outbreak that was declared a pandemic Wednesday by the World Health Organization. The spreading illness was expected to dominant discussions, as stock markets continued their downward spiral after an oil shock sent equities crashing Monday to their worst single-day drop since 1987. The Prime Minister's Office said the meeting between the premiers and Trudeau will be postponed, but that the prime minister will speak with his counterparts over the phone ""to discuss our collective action to limit the spread of COVID-19 and keep Canadians safe."" ""The prime minister will spend the day in briefings, phone calls, and virtual meetings from home, including speaking with other world leaders and joining the special COVID-19 cabinet committee discussion,"" Trudeau's office said.

The pause came after the S&P/TSX composite index fell more than 1,000 points at the start of trading.

In the release, it says the COVID-19 task force comprises key managers from all City divisions and agencies and are now situated at the centre, planning for various responses, including: • the potential for increased staff absenteeism due to illness and the impact on the City's ability to deliver core services • global supply chain challenges for personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves for frontline workers and first responders • actions undertaken to protect vulnerable populations, such as those experiencing homelessness or in City-run long-term care homes • developing, sharing and continually updating critical information for residents and visitors to the city • forecasting and responding to economic impacts the pandemic may have on residents and businesses. 8:25 a.m.: A spokeswoman for New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs says he will not attend the first ministers meeting today in Ottawa now that his province has reported its first presumptive case of COVID-19. Spokeswoman Nicolle Carlin said this morning Higgs has decided he must stay in New Brunswick.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer, says health officials learned Wednesday that a woman between 50 and 60 years old living in the southeastern area of the province was ""minimally symptomatic"" after returning from a trip to France. New Brunswick is the first Atlantic province to report a presumptive case of the disease. 8:21 a.m.: Dow Jones futures are down more than 1,000 points as U.S. stock markets brace for more losses Thursday after President Donald Trump's speech on the coronavirus outbreak seemingly failed to ease investors' concerns.

On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 1,464 points, dragging it 20 per cent below the record set last month and putting the index in a bear market. If the S&P 500 closes down more than 1 per cent, that would put the index in bear market territory and bring an end to the longest bull market in U.S. history. Overseas markets suffered steep losses. Most stock markets in Asia fell more than three per cent and markets in Europe are seeing declines of six per cent or more. 8:06 a.m.: Inmates at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre are being quarantined after an offender claimed to have been previously in contact with someone with COVID-19. The infection protocol was done as a precautionary measure. Alberta and B.C. officials confirmed they haven't identified the individual identified by the offender as being infected, said Noel Busse, Director of Communications for Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice/Corrections and Policing on March 11. ""Until we have completely ruled out any potential contact between this individual and COVID-19, we are undertaking precautionary infection control measures in our correctional facilities as necessary."" Seven inmates were being transported with the original offender. Six living areas out of 13 are under quarantine at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre.The quarantine impacts 158 offenders. 7:33 a.m.: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was tested for the new coronavirus on Thursday after meeting with Cabinet officials who were exposed to infected people and have now been self-quarantined, an official said. Duterte has no symptoms of COVID-19 but wanted to make sure he is healthy and can continue to engage with the public, said Sen. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go, a former presidential aide who still accompanies Duterte to official functions. ""Considering that some Cabinet members we engage with regularly have been exposed to individuals who were tested positive for COVID-19 ... it is just prudent for us to take precautionary measures in compliance with the advice of our health officials,"" Go said. 7:28 a.m.: Iran said Thursday it had asked for an emergency $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to help fight the spread of a new virus that's swept across the country, infecting more than 10,000 people and killing hundreds. Iran's Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced in a now-daily televised news conference that 75 people had died in the past 24 hours and more than 1,000 new cases of infection had been confirmed, pushing the death toll to 429 and confirmed cases to 10,075. In a tweet Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the IMF to ""stand on right side of history & act responsibly"" by releasing the funds through the international lender's Rapid Financial Instrument. Iran's Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati said Thursday he made the request for $5 billion last week in a letter to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. The IMF has said it stands ready to support countries battling the virus. 7:05 a.m.: The European Union on Thursday lashed out at President Donald Trump's ""unilateral"" decision to restrict travel from Europe to the United States over the coronavirus, saying that the illness does not respect borders. Trump announced that all European travel would be cut off, but U.S. officials later clarified that restrictions would apply only to most foreign citizens who have been in Europe's passport-free travel zone at any point for 14 days prior to their arrival to the United States. ""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" EU Council President Charles Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement. ""The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires co-operation rather than unilateral action,"" the two said. 5:16 a.m.: A spike in cases in the Persian Gulf states helped push infections in the Middle East for the new coronavirus past 10,000 cases on Thursday, with most infected people either in Iran or having recently travelled there. Iran has asked for an emergency $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to combat the outbreak there, which has killed more than 360 people and infected some 9,000 people in the Islamic Republic. Iran's Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati said Thursday he made the request last week in a letter to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. The international lender has said it stands ready to support countries through a Rapid Financial Instrument. -with files from The Canadian Press SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Spec More from The Spec & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. Two more area residents have tested positive for COVID-19, including a Halton woman who had symptoms during two WestJet flights. The new Hamilton case announced Thursday is a 52-year-old man who returned from New York City on March 5. He is now in self-isolation with his spouse and teenage son. ""Our staff are in the midst of working with this individual to determine what their movements were,"" said Dr. Bart Harvey, an associate medical officer of health in Hamilton. ""And to identify any individuals who will be asked to go into self-isolation because they would have had a contact with this individual that could be consistent with the ability to transmit the virus."" A ripple effect is being felt locally after an increasing number of cases in Ontario, including a total of three in Hamilton and Halton. There were 59 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario on Thursday, up from 42 the day before. One of the cases is a boy under the age of one in Toronto. It has prompted school closures across the province, event cancellations and store shelves stripped bare of hand sanitizer, toilet paper, paper towel and canned goods. Harvey warned that only people feeling unwell with symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath will be tested for COVID-19. ""Part of the challenge is that people are understandably worried,"" he said at a media conference Thursday at city hall. ""Someone who is feeling well but is worried and therefore wants to get themselves tested, they are not going to get tested. They are slowing down the system."" The Hamilton man was in New York for work and is believed to have caught COVID-19 at a meeting he attended there. ""He was contacted by a colleague who was at the same meeting ... to say, 'I became sick, I got tested,'"" said Harvey. ""That was his tip-off to be extra vigilant that he'd been in the environs of somebody."" Public health would not provide any information Thursday on where the man works. ""Our staff is talking to him and trying to determine … whether he was there and if he was, who he interacted with and identifying people who may be at high risk of having had the virus transmitted to them,"" said Harvey. When the man started experiencing symptoms, he contacted public health and co-ordinated with them to get tested at the West End Clinic urgent care centre on March 10. Public health got the positive result Wednesday afternoon, but the information was not made public until late morning Thursday. Harvey said that was the province's decision. ""There's a process that needs to go through with the ministry to co-ordinate all of this and to verify things,"" he said. ""This isn't instant reporting ... The ministry does regular postings of their announcements at 5:30 p.m. and 10:30 a.m."" He didn't say why the result was not reported in the 5:30 p.m. update on Wednesday. A similar time lag occurred when public health discovered Tuesday night that a radiation oncologist at Juravinski Cancer Centre was Hamilton and Halton's first case of COVID-19, but the information wasn't made public until late Wednesday morning. It was originally thought that the 32-year-old cancer doctor treated 14 patients on Monday afternoon in Clinic A, but it now turns out that three missed their appointments so it is actually 11 people. She also worked with nine staff before realizing she had contracted the virus during a trip to Hawaii that ended Saturday. One of those staff is an oncologist who left the country Wednesday morning before being informed of the risk. Harvey said public health has now found the doctor, although he did not say where she is travelling. She does have travel companions with her and Harvey said it's not possible to have her self-isolate there. ""Our staff has spoken to them, alerted them of the situation and certainly made them aware that they should be extra vigilant about potentially developing symptoms,"" he said. ""Certainly, if they become symptomatic, then wherever they are, they will seek assessment and testing and go from there."" The radiation oncologist who has COVID-19 is married to a surgeon at St. Joseph's Healthcare but he has tested negative for the virus. The new case in Halton is an Oakville woman in her 40s who travelled to Colorado earlier this month and became symptomatic on March 7. She went to Joseph Brant Hospital for testing March 10 and received the positive result March 11. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now She has been determined to have had symptoms on WestJet Flight 2644 on March 7 from Toronto to Liberia in Costa Rica. She was also symptomatic on her return trip on WestJet Flight 2643 from Costa Rica to Toronto on March 9. Passengers on those flights are being asked to self-monitor for 14 days and report themselves to their local public health unit if they develop symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever. So far there is no worry for the passengers on the New York or Hawaii flights that the Hamilton cases took because they were not symptomatic until more than 24 hours later. ""Right now the working principle is that, to be on the safe side, we need to consider these infected individuals as being able to transmit the virus 24 hours before they become symptomatic,"" said Harvey. ""We are including that window when we go to identify folks who might have had close contact and need to go into self-isolation."" Hamilton and Halton public health departments say Joseph Brant and the West End Clinic took all proper precautions including testing in an isolated environment and having staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE). Halton public health is currently tracing the woman's contacts. ""I would like to reassure residents that the risk in our community remains low at this time and we are working to identify known contacts and assess any potential health risk,"" Dr. Hamidah Meghani, Halton's medical officer of health, said in a statement. In an email obtained by The Spectator, HHS told its staff that it's ""strongly advising against"" travelling outside of Canada. Staff who do travel internationally must notify Employee Health Services before leaving. Workers are also asked to stay home if they are sick ""Don't stockpile masks or other PPE supplies,"" states the email. ""HHS is only receiving a fixed allocation from suppliers so stocks are limited."" Those with symptoms in Halton can contact 905-825-6000 or toll free at 1-866-442-5866 Hamilton's COVID-19 hotline is 905-546-2424, ext. 7970, or phscovid19@hamilton.ca or hamilton.ca/coronavirus. The three cases in Hamilton and Halton involve: • A 32-year-old radiation oncologist at Juravinski Cancer Centre who lives in Burlington and recently returned from Hawaii; • An Oakville woman in her 40s who travelled to Colorado and Costa Rica; • A 52-year-old man who returned from New York City March 5. jfrketich@thespec.com 905-526-3349 | @Jfrketich Read more about: Burlington SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Spec More from The Spec & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Here's how to get your money back By Stephanie M. Hughes Special to the Star Sun., March 15, 2020timer5 min. read When Anis Doba got the news that his tour operator cancelled his family's trip to Saudi Arabia, he knew he wouldn't be able to see his son play in a soccer tournament taking place there. But what he didn't know was that he also wouldn't be seeing a refund. Doba booked his trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey with a travel group using Dar El Salam, an Islamic travel agency based in North America. The Doba family was given little notice when Saudi Arabia's recent coronavirus-related travel restrictions put a halt to their March travel plans. Without travel insurance, the family was left in the lurch. ""I was confused and angry,"" Anis told the Star, ""We are six in the family and spent lots of money."" With the federal government issuing an advisory against ""non-essential"" travel outside the country, and the inconvenience of having to self-isolate upon the return from a holiday, many Canadians are desperately trying to cancel vacations that may have been books months ago. Compounding the problem is the fact that people hoping to make a claim through their travel insurance policy for coronavirus-related cancellations may be out of luck. Many insurance providers will no longer reimburse customers, either because they have pandemic exclusions, or because they say COVID-19 is no longer considered an unexpected circumstance. Companies in the travel industry are also rapidly changing their cancellation policies — aiming to reassure customers in less than assuring times. If you need to cancel a previously-booked trip, read on for tips on what to do to make sure you get your money back. Airlines waiving cancellation fees Many airlines are waiving cancellation fees and are finding ways to actively work with customers to change vacation plans, though they are asking that you only call if your flight is within 72 hours to limit mass complaint volume. Delta Air Lines explained in a letter to customers that guests who booked flights that take place between March 3 and 31 would have the ""ability to change their flight without the applicable charge fees."" Change and cancellation restrictions would also be removed for guests who booked a basic fare any time before April. Joining this fee-waiving trend is United Airlines (for travel scheduled between March 10 and April 30 or tickets purchased in March) and Air Canada (for departures before May). This comes along with Air Canada's announcement that the company is suspending flights to Italy and other nations impacted by COVID-19, as well as offering free flight changes and cancellations made up to two hours before the departure time. WestJet Airlines, Air Transat and Sunwing are also waiving rebooking fees. WestJet Airlines has a one-time change fee waiver within two weeks of travel for bookings made between March 3 and March 17 for travel through June 24. Customers who booked flights on all routes offered by Air Transat, including South packages, between March 4 and 31 for travel between now and Oct. 31 can change their date or destination without penalty. Sunwing allows customers to make one change without penalty if their booking was confirmed by March 19 and had a departure date up to and including June 24. Sunwing says passengers can purchase insurance that allows cancellation for any reason without fees up to three hours before departure. Cruise lines offering credit and refund The Prime Minister announced that the Government would postpone Canada's cruise ship season to July 1 at the earliest and would ban cruise ships from docking in northern communities. Responding to COVID-19 measures, cruise lines are giving customers an easy way out: most companies are offering cruise credit and refunds for cancellations made until the end of March 31, but some policies extend further. Royal Caribbean announced Saturday that it would suspend U.S. cruises departing between March 14 and April 10. Customers that booked a trip at this time can claim a refund up until December 31, 2021. Carnival Cruise Lines will also be pausing North American operations and plans to resume on April 10. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now Princess Cruises cancelled all its voyages for the next two months. The suspension applies to voyages departing March 12 to May 10. The cruise line is owned by Carnival Corp. Two Princess Cruises ships — one in Japan in January and another in California — have had to halt trips and quarantine thousands of passengers because of the illness. Before the suspensions, the cruise credit offer worked well for Jason Pereira and his wife's family, who had no issues cancelling a March Break cruise with Royal Caribbean with the promise of future compensation. ""Given that three people are over 70, and one of the others has a health issue, we opted to cancel to play it safe on their behalf,"" he said. The offer was on the table if the family cancelled by Wednesday before the March Break week and the credit is good until the end of 2021. Hotels waiving cancellation fees Hotel giants Marriott and Hilton announced they would be waiving cancellation fees for reservations made in regions impacted by COVID-19. Both Marriott and Hilton's policies extends to April 30, covering all reservations made up to 24 hours before the arrival date. Don't count on travel insurance Normally, the best way to protect yourself from unexpected cancellations would be to purchase trip cancellation insurance. But some insurers now say they won't cover claims relating to the pandemic if travellers visit an area where COVID-19 is known to be prevalent, because the risk of contracting the disease in such areas is a ""known issue."" Canadian insurance provider Manulife said it will not cover COVID-19 medical claims on individual policies when travellers visit an area for which the government has issued a high-level advisory. Allianz Global Assistance Canada will not cover COVID-19 claims for travellers who visit a country that issued a level 3 or level 4 travel advisory before they departed. It has also voided coverage for people leaving on cruise ship vacations on or after March 9. Medical costs due to issues other than COVID-19 will still be covered, as will claims related to the virus in areas where there have been no advisories. As of Friday, Canada Life Assurance and Sun Life Financial had not changed their group plan coverage and still covered COVID-19 related claims, even in countries where a travel advisory had been issued.

Western announced on Thursday night that classes from Friday to Tuesday would be cancelled, and that classes would resume online on March 18. Laurentian told students on Wednesday that all classes would be moved online until further notice. Oshawa's Ontario Tech University also announced on Thursday night that Friday classes would be cancelled and Durham College is cancelling classes until Monday. Ruby Resome, a second-year journalism student at Ryerson University, started one such petition on Thursday afternoon after hearing news about the cancellations of various sports leagues as well as classes at other universities around the world. She and her friends circulated her petition on Instagram and within eight hours, it had amassed over 2,100 signatures. The province has ordered the cancellation of classes for public schools until April 5, but the order does not apply to post-secondary institutions. ""I definitely think the school has the funds and the need to continue the rest of the semester online,"" said Resome. ""I just think that they needed a little bit of a push from the student body to actually make that happen."" Ryerson declined to comment on the petition when asked, but referred the Star to its website, where it posts COVID-19-related updates. As of Thursday evening, the university says that it is continuing normal operations and has been following the advice of public heath officials. Resome said she hasn't seen any event cancellations - her CPR training is still scheduled to take place on campus this Sunday. But the University of Toronto released a statement on Thursday mid-afternoon recommending cancelling or postponing events that aren't part of courses and academic requirements. Over 10,000 people have also signed an online petition calling on U of T to cancel classes. U of T says that it is ""actively planning for the possibility that the current pandemic may affect our operations."" has and cancelled university activity abroad until June 1 and is working with students already abroad to support them in either staying or planning for an early return. But classes and other academic activities have not been cancelled. Alex Forgay, a third-year geography student at U of T, is calling on his school to cancel classes. He notes that some first-year lectures at U of T have more than 1,000 students and health officials have advised the public to avoid large gatherings. ""It's very frustrating that you have to make a decision between your own well-being . and your own academic future,"" said Forgay. Some instructors have taken it upon themselves to make accomodations. Forgay said one of his professors is letting him do a group presentation online after two of his group memebers were asked by health officials to stay home for the next week. Another petition calling on York University to cancel classes has also amassed over 10,000 signatures. York University announced on Wednesday that all academic programming and other activities are proceeding as scheduled, but is cancelling university-related travel to 10 countries and regions defined by the Canadian government as having a high number of COVID-19 cases. OCAD University is also continuing classes, but has cancelled its graduate exhibition scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 3. Universities Canada, which is the voice of universities nationwide, says its members are taking directives from public health agencies and are prioritizing the health if its community. ""Universities have contingency plans in place should the situation escalate, and are individually assessing the needs and unique circumstances of their communities and acting accordingly,"" said spokesperson Alison Evans. David Lindsay, president and CEO of Council of Ontario Universities, says the province's universities have ""detailed pandemic plans that address the specific conditions of their institutions"" and are ""well positioned to respond to local challenges as they emerge."" Similarly, Colleges Ontario, an advocacy group representing the province's public colleges, says members are in regular contact with public health officials. ""Every college has extensive pandemic plans and protocols but there hasn't been a case at this point where a college has had to cancel classes,"" said spokesperson Rob Savage. ""The sector's vice-presidents of academic are currently discussing options. Those options will be presented (Friday) to college presidents during a system-wide teleconference meeting that Colleges Ontario is co-ordinating.""

The unprecedented move by the Ford government — believed to be a first for the province, and country — begins March 23 and impacts the province's more than two million students. ""I want every parent and family to know with confidence that when their child returns to school, they will be in a safe and healthy learning environment,"" Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Thursday afternoon. Lecce, speaking to reporters at Queen's Park, noted there will be ""additional resources for sanitation and hygiene products"" so schools are thoroughly cleaned between March Break, which starts Monday, and before students return to class April 6. He also said measures will be introduced in the days ahead so kids can still learn online. ""With respect to how do we achieve the continuity of learning, I'm committing to parents that (a program) is being finalized,"" he said. Lecce issued the ministerial order to shutter the province's 4,800 public schools based on the recommendation of Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said ""the decision to close Ontario's schools to contain the spread of COVID-19 was not an easy one, and I support it."" However, she said parents will be scrambling to arrange child care if they cannot take time off. ""Two million kids will be out of school and hundreds of thousands of parents will be home from work,"" she said. ""Parents need to be assured that they can stay home with their kids, and that they will not lose a paycheque — and cannot be fired — for doing that."" If parents stay home from work, it ""will create a ripple right through our province. TTC drivers are moms and dads. Health-care staff have children of their own. Small business owners have children."" Earlier this week, the New Brunswick government banned any staff or students who travel outside of Canada — including to the United States — from its schools and daycares for two weeks. The English Montreal School Board has told staff and students who have travelled to the hardest-hit countries to stay home, even if they feel fine. Many boards in Ontario have already cancelled all international school trips. As of Thursday, more than 10,600 American schools — public and private — had been closed or are set to close, according to EdWeek. The online education journal reported that more than 4.6 million students are now impacted and ""schools are closing for many reasons related to coronavirus, including exposures, cleaning, or planning for extended closures."" Around the world, about 40 countries have shuttered some or all schools. France has just announced all schools and universities will be shuttered. In 2009, during the swine flu pandemic, a number of public schools in Manitoba, New Brunswick and Montreal closed for a short time. Earlier Thursday in Ottawa, Premier Doug Ford said while the situation was fluid, he wanted Ontarians to enjoy their March Break. ""It can change at any day. But I just want the families and their children to have a good time,"" the premier said. ""Go away, have a good time, enjoy yourself, and we're going to be monitoring the situation as it changes every single day. But I just want them to enjoy themselves just now."" Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now Ford's comments came hours before the first ministers' meeting was cancelled after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, went into self-isolation to await a coronavirus test. Mississauga mother Rachelle Manios, who has daughters in Grades 5 and 7, thinks closing schools is ""excessive,"" but it doesn't bother her. She wondered how school boards will respond, saying ""my kids have a legal right to be educated. Is the school board going to now be supplying online education for my girls?"" Toronto parent Stephanie Kirby, who has two children in public school, said ""we're in uncharted territory and I feel we all have something to lose in this so we need to take precautions wherever we can."" Kirby, who works part-time, said ""my kids were supposed to be going way on a trip (to Paris) with my parents and we decided a couple of days ago to cancel."" Among post-secondary institutions, Laurentian University in Sudbury suspended all classes as of March 11, moving courses online for the remainder of the semester. Other colleges and universities say they are currently monitoring the situation. A number of American universities have already stopped classes and are moving online, including Harvard and Yale. In the legislature Thursday, NDP Education Critic Marit Stiles said ""school boards are already taking extra precautions to guard against outbreaks. Custodians are logging extra hours. Extra cleaning and sanitizing supplies are being ordered. But at a time when we've seen school boards squeezed and custodial staff laid off, the government needs to be prepared to provide resources as necessary."" Cathy Abraham, president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association, said ""the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and rapidly evolving event that requires an unprecedented response."" Ontario's chief medical officer of health said all daycare centres need to adopt strict screening of parents and children at the daily drop-off — with the same rigour that nursing homes and retirement homes have been directed to use in screening staff, visitors and volunteers — to keep sick children out and help prevent any spread of the COVID-19 virus. ""Ask the parents, 'is your child well and have you been on any trips lately in the last 14 days?' And if you have I would rather you not bring your child in today and wait until after that 14-day period,"" he told reporters. ""I'm giving guidance and direction to do that.""

Tam repeated the messaging from Ottawa that Canadians abroad should get home now, and self-isolate for 14 days. COVID-19 is ""rapidly increasing in Canada,"" she said.

Both the Retail Council of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said supplies of groceries and other basics would continue to flow even if the outbreak of the novel coronavirus triggered widespread store or border closures. That possibility loomed larger after the country's chief public health officer stopped describing the situation as low-risk. ""Our window to flatten the curve of the epidemic is narrow,"" Dr. Theresa Tam said at a news conference. ""We all need to act now. COVID-19 is a serious public health threat."" Tam's new assessment did not immediately trigger fresh advice to prevent the spread of the pandemic. Tam repeated previous government messages about avoiding large public gatherings, practising social distancing and avoiding travel outside of Canada. She did clarify, however, that Canadians returning from trips abroad should immediately go into self-isolation for 14 days rather than simply self-monitoring. Fears associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have triggered a rush on drug and grocery stores across the country as people flocked to buy basics en masse. While the Retail Council of Canada said the current high demand for food, toilet paper and other staples is understandable as the number of positive cases continues to climb, it urged Canadians not to succumb to panic. Marc Fortin, president of the council's Quebec chapter, said supply chains continue to function as normal and goods will continue to flow even if major trading partners close their borders in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. ""Groceries and pharmacies are considered essential services, so they will remain open,"" he said. ""We have plenty of food, plenty of goods."" Fortin said about 70 per cent of commonly purchased items are produced domestically, ensuring their continued availability in Canadian stores. He acknowledged the situation is more precarious for fresh produce and other items being imported into the country at this time of year, but said retailers have suppliers in a variety of countries and have contingency plans in place. Trudeau also urged retail restraint on Sunday during an television interview with CTV's Question Period conducted outside his home, where he is currently in self-isolation along with his family. He said Canada's supply chains to date have not been affected by the tightening border restrictions around the world, merchandise is still coming across the border, and there's no need to start hoarding supplies. ""Yes, stock up a little bit so you don't have to go to the store every two or three days like we usually do, but make sure that you're not taking more than you need,"" he said. ""Your neighbours, or vulnerable people, will need to access supplies as well."" Trudeau said a measured approach will be important in all aspects of life as Canadians navigate the outbreak, which has so far infected more than 300 people in the country, and caused one death. The number of cases continued to climb on Sunday, with Ontario reporting 39 new cases, bringing the total to 142. Health authorities in Quebec reported 11 new cases, prompting Premier Francois Legault to call for the closure of public places in the province such as bars, gyms, libraries and movie theatres. Legault did not include stores or restaurants in his message, but urged eateries to operate at 50 per cent capacity in order to promote social distancing. The Manitoba government reported three more cases in that province, bringing the total to seven. And authorities in Nova Scotia said COVID-19 had officially reached that province after three people tested positive for the virus. Premier Stephen McNeil responded by announcing schools and daycare centres would be closed for two weeks following March break, which is set to begin Monday. Most people diagnosed with COVID-19 experience mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority of those who contract the virus recover. However, for some, including Canadians aged 65 and over, those with compromised immune systems and those with pre-existing conditions, the illness can be much more severe. Among the Canadians diagnosed with the illness so far, fewer than 15 per cent have required hospitalization.

In a statement issued Sunday, Premier Doug Ford said he had directed government to draft legislation responding the COVID-19 outbreak that will include measures to ensure employers provide ""protected leave."" ""Our government is protecting workers so they can focus on their own health, and the health of their families and communities, without fear of losing their jobs,"" the premier said. It is unclear when the new provisions will become a reality. The provincial legislature is not currently sitting and proceedings may not resume until March 23 at the earliest. Ontario had reported 142 cases of the virus as of Sunday morning. Due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19, MPPs unanimously voted to give government the ability to suspend the legislature as a health protection measure, if necessary. In response to questions from the Star, the premier's spokesperson Ivana Yelich said government would ""pass the legislation as expeditiously as possible."" Opposition leader Andrea Horwath said the New Democrats ""will be co-operating to draft and pass a bill to help people in Ontario weather the storm. ""I'm pleased that the government is now drafting emergency legislation to help Ontarians cope with the COVID-19 pandemic,"" she said. The new measures will apply both to employees who are in self-isolation or quarantine, or those who are providing care to others. Yelich did not say whether the legislation would include any provisions for paid leave. ""The NDP will be working hard to ensure the emergency legislation helps people take time off work without losing a paycheque,"" Horwath said. ""We want to ensure no one faces consequences for missing a rent or mortgage payment through no fault of their own."" Deena Ladd of the Toronto-based Workers' Action Centre said waiving doctors' notes requirements was ""very important so that we're not clogging up hospitals and emergency rooms and walk-in clinics."" But she said the measure alone was ""absolutely not"" sufficient. ""Most workers go paycheque to paycheque. For low-wage workers it's even more intense because most don't have drug and dental benefits. They don't have paid sick days. And then they're losing their income,"" she said. Worker advocates have called for Ontario to implement 14 paid sick days for quarantines, and seven permanent paid sick days.

Those provisions were reversed by Ford's government in 2018. Workers' entitlements were reduced to three unpaid, job-protected sick days. But the spread of COVID-19 — and its disproportionate impact on low-wage workers, many of whom cannot work from home — has sharpened policy-makers' attention to workplace leave policies. Steven Del Duca, the newly elected leader of Ontario's Liberal Party, said he was ""pleased the government is taking a collaborative approach."" ""We will be studying the legislation closely and are hopeful the government will introduce paid leave along with a number of other measures because workers should not have to choose between paying their bills and self-isolation."" Alberta's provincial government announced new measures to provide workers with 14 job-protected sick days, and waive the requirement to provide doctors' notes. Ladd said more measures were needed to help workers cope with the fallout of businesses and institutions shutting down, including an emergency relief fund for workers who do not have access to federally administered Employment Insurance. In the United States, Congress passed an emergency coronavirus bill Friday that includes a provision for two weeks of paid sick leave for some workers impacted by COVID-19. ""Additional details of our government's ongoing efforts to support Ontario families during the difficult period ahead will be announced in the coming days,"" the premier's statement said. ""We look forward to working with the federal government on further measures to enhance financial support for businesses and workers.""

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. Please see the latest coverage on the coronavirus outbreak McMaster University is telling thousands of students to move out of its residences ""as soon as possible"" to help slow the spread of COVID-19. The news was first posted online late Monday in a letter from president David Farrar. On Tuesday, the province declared a state of emergency due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The university is now telling students they are ""required"" to move out of McMaster's 13 different on-campus residence buildings by March 21 at 4 p.m. Ideally, most of the 4,200 students living in McMaster residences should leave ""as soon as possible."" Special parking areas were already designated last week for parents helping students load belongings. Around 500 students had already left as of Tuesday. The news prompted immediate questions from the community online. ""Let's not forget about international students who will be left behind. Are there plans to support their needs during this transition?"" tweeted Kojo Damptey, the interim executive director for the Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion. Dean of students Sean Van Koughnett said the university will consider applications to stay in residence from the 412 international students currently living on campus. Out-of-province students can also ask for an extension. Details are available to students on the school's web portal. ""We know there are students who just can't go home and we will work to accommodate them,"" he said. The university also said it will provide ""financial consideration"" to students leaving early who have paid for a full term and meal plan in residence — so long as they leave by the March 21 deadline. More details on potential refunds will be posted in the coming days. Farrar said in his letter that as COVID-19 pandemics concerns have mounted, the university has been forced to make ""decisions we never could have imagined making just days ago."" The university had earlier announced the suspension of in-person classes and exams for this term. The institution is still working on plans to allow students to finish the academic year online. Mohawk College has already encouraged students who live in its Mountain residence to go home if they can. Calls to Columbia College were not returned Tuesday, but the private college indicated on its website it expects students to participate in e-learning rather than face-to-face classes.

The death of a 77-year-old man in Barrie's Royal Victoria Hospital was one of 12 new cases reported in the province Tuesday - a low number compared with a surge in recent days and a backlog of more than 1,500 tests pending. ""We don't think there's enough tests in Ontario,"" chief medical officer Dr. David Williams said Tuesday, cautioning against interpretations that the sudden drop in new cases signifies a ""downward trend."" One of the new cases is a health-care worker in her 20s who travelled to Las Vegas recently and was on the job at the London Health Sciences Centre, interacting ""closely"" with patients and staff while showing symptoms, the local health unit said Tuesday. It is tracing patients and other contacts. While provincial lab capacity has been increased to almost 2,000 tests a day - almost double the level a week ago - efforts are underway to boost that to 5,000 per day as concerns about the novel coronavirus grow following Premier Doug Ford's emergency declaration and increasing person-to-person spread. The snag is a combination of lab capacity and the fact some testing swabs come from a factory in northern Italy, the hardest-hit region of a country reeling from COVID-19 with a rapidly increasing case count and death toll. Health Minister Christine Elliott said the unidentified man who died in the Barrie hospital on March 11 had underlying health conditions and had been in ""close contact with someone who had COVID-19."" But he was not tested until after his death, for which no reason was given. The exact cause of his death won't be clear until a coroner's investigation to determine if it was ""because of COVID-19 or with COVID-19,"" Elliott said. ""That's a really important distinction."" The case, which flew under the radar despite heightened awareness of the new coronavirus, raises the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 within the hospital. Royal Victoria president Janice Skot said staff have ""carefully tracked the patient's movements throughout the health centre and.notified staff and physicians as appropriate."" The fatality is ""further evidence of the increasing seriousness of the situation we are in,"" Williams said. Ontario's case count has more than tripled in the last week. With increasing demand for tests at assessment centres outside hospitals and concerns cases are expanding from travel-related causes, associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said the province is working with its public health branch to create ""more clear criteria"" for who should be eligible. The centres are seeing visits from large numbers of ""the worried well,"" added Yaffe, who stressed ""we do not want any people tested who have no symptoms."" Test eligibility has been based on travel history, contact with anyone who has travelled or other clinical reasons that could point to possible COVID-19. Most of Ontario's 185 cases since the outbreak began have been recovering in self-isolation at home, but one is intubated and on a ventilator in hospital and another was seriously ill but is doing better, Williams told reporters at a daily briefing. Another five cases have been cleared after testing negative in two separate tests more than 24 hours apart. The province is bracing for a potential influx of cases as Ontarians travelling abroad or snowbirds wintering in the sunny south of the United States prepared to head for home amid repeated calls from the federal government to do so while commercial means remain available. ""Have some come into contact with COVID-19 without knowing?"" said Williams, who noted anyone returning will have to self-isolate for 14 days at home and monitor themselves for symptoms. The growing case count in the United States is of increasing concern, with 29 per cent of Ontario's purely travel-related cases now coming from there and mainly from six states: New York, Colorado, California, Florida, Nevada and Massachusetts.

Armed with hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, she and her family travelled through their Burlington, Ont., neighbourhood distributing homemade flyers offering their free services to the many seniors and other vulnerable residents in their community. Teufel-Shatilla said she, her husband, and their blended family of seven kids over the age of 13 are ready and willing to pick up groceries, drop off medication, or otherwise ensure that those isolated during the increasingly serious outbreak have what they need to get through the crisis in comfort. ""If my mom wasn't local, or if I had somebody who was undergoing chemo or had suppressed immunity, I would hope that somebody would do that for somebody I love,"" Teufel-Shatilla said in a telephone interview. Teufel-Shatilla said she felt it was important to try and inject a little positivity into lives that have otherwise been consumed by the increasingly bleak news related to the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has all but brought everyday life to a halt as cases continue to mount. The grim developments continued to pour in on Monday, with officials in British Columbia reporting an additional three deaths from the virus. The growing number of cases, which has eclipsed 400 nationwide, prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to close the Canadian border to all foreign nationals with the exception of U.S. citizens. But amid the slew of disheartening headlines are scattered myriad posts from organizations and individuals trying to strike a more positive tone. A Sobeys location in Edmonton garnered much praise when it briefly offered a dedicated, early-morning shopping hour reserved for seniors. Later posts indicated the approach had to be cancelled for reasons beyond the company's control, but also thanked community members for supporting the idea and offering free rides to shoppers who required support. Toronto-based author Catherine Hernandez began hosting a virtual story time for young children kept at home due to school and daycare closures, with the readings streamed via her Facebook page. And in Montreal, a Facebook page set up by a group of local teenagers began offering babysitting services to parents unable to stay home with their children. Group co-founder Taowa Munene-Tardif, 17, said the group originally consisted of past and present students drawn from the same high school. As word spread, however, he said dozens of would-be volunteers have since joined in. He said the students are all observing public health protocols in their interactions with local families, adding the teens are all keen to contribute during an unusually stressful time. ""We figured, 'well, we have time, why not do something positive,'"" Munene-Tardif said. Trudeau advocated exactly such an approach on Monday during the address in which he announced the partial border closure. He urged Canadians to maintain safe contact with relatives, friends and neighbours to ensure everyone pulls through the outbreak. ""The strength of our country is our capacity to come together and care for each other, especially in times of need,"" he said. ""So call your friends. Check in with your family. Think of your community."" One woman said her family has already benefited from the unsolicited kindness of strangers. Isabel Jordan of Squamish, B.C., wasn't actively asking for help when she started musing on a community Facebook group about the trouble that can ensue when people hoard hand sanitizer. Three of her four family members have underlying lung conditions, and Jordan said she was simply commiserating about the challenge of replenishing her home's supply at local stores that had been effectively cleaned out. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now But Jordan said her post instantly prompted numerous offers of help, some from people she had never met. Group members offered to scour nearby stores for new stock or top her family up from their own supplies. ""It's nice to see people who are not as vulnerable understand that they have this health privilege,"" she said. ""Reaching out to help others is really heartening, because I don't necessarily see that a lot.""

Correctional Services Canada says there are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Bowden Institution, but a group of less than 10 inmates has been tested for the novel coronavirus. Correctional Services Canada says the health and safety of its employees, offenders and the public is its top priority and it continues to take preventative measures, including testing any offenders as required. It says it has its own health care services in its institutions and can handle cases of influenza and respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. 7:18 p.m.: The start of the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments that define success in tennis, will be postponed from May 24 until Sept. 20 because of the coronavirus, organizers announced Tuesday - immediately drawing criticism for not consulting others in the game. The date change created conflicts with other events, including the Laver Cup men's team event headlined by Roger Federer that is scheduled for Sept. 25-27 in Boston, and a women's tournament in Wuhan, China, the city at the center of the global pandemic. Player Vasek Pospisil said the decision came ""out of the blue ... They are basically doing a power play right now, and it's quite arrogant."" 7:15 p.m.: The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs have declared a state of emergency for 62 First Nations due to COVID-19. The move includes closing reserve borders to non-essential travel. Grand Chief Arlen Dumas says First Nations do not have the physical housing ability to socially isolate and must take extra precautions. The Southern Chiefs' Organization also declared a state of emergency earlier Tuesday saying First Nations are at risk due to chronic overcrowding, lack of equitable health care and poor infrastructure. None of the 15 cases of the novel coronavirus in Manitoba have been reported from a First Nation. 6:48 p.m.: Late Tuesday afternoon Hudson's Bay announced that all 89 of its stores nationwide would be closing for at least two weeks, effective immediately. ""During this closure, our store associates will be paid for all scheduled shifts that were planned for the two weeks,"" the company added in a statement. The Holt Renfrew and H&M retail chains also announced temporary, immediate closure of all stores on Tuesday, with the latter being effective across North America. 6:29 p.m.:Three more people in British Columbia have died from novel coronavirus as provincial health officials said they were experiencing a spike in cases. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry confirmed the deaths on Tuesday and said there are 83 new confirmed cases in B.C. of COVID-19, a marked increase from previous daily updates. Henry also announced that B.C. has declared a public health emergency. There are now 186 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C. and eight deaths in Canada so far - seven in B.C. and one in Ontario. Alberta, meanwhile, is reporting 23 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 97. 6:12 p.m.: A man in his 70s who has died was one of four new cases of COVID-19 announced Tuesday afternoon in the province of Ontario. Three of the new cases are travel related but not the deceased, whose contraction of the virus was blamed by provincial authorities on ""close contact"" with someone else affected. This increase of 12 on Tuesday - eight announced in the morning, four in the afternoon - brings Ontario's total cases to 189. The dead man's case was reported by the Simcoe Muskoka district health unit, north of Toronto. The other three were in the Kingston region and had just returned from travel - to Spain, Barbados and the U.K. 5:59 p.m.:After struggling for days to secure a flight home for a group of students on a humanitarian mission to Guatemala, a Quebec school board paid $280,000 for a chartered flight that scooped them out of the Central American country minutes before its border closed. The 45 high school students and five teachers were on the last plane out of the Guatemala City airport Monday night, Helene Dumais, spokeswoman for the Commission scolaire des Grandes-Seigneuries, said Tuesday. They landed Tuesday morning at Montreal-Trudeau International Airport, she said, less than one week after the group left to work in a centre for disabled people in the Guatemalan village of San Juan La Laguna. 5:10 p.m.: In an effort to get COVID-19 tests to the public more quickly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is waiving the normal regulations and allowing test makers to market scientifically valid products in the U.S. immediately. The FDA announced updated federal guidelines Monday night - which it called ""unprecedented"" - to allow new tests for COVID-19 to go onto the U.S. market. A Salt Lake City company called Co-Diagnostics said Tuesday morning that it intends to quickly distribute its Logix Smart COVID-19 test to certified labs around the country. In the U.S., all tests being performed to detect COVID-19 work by detecting snippets of viral genetic code in a patient sample. They require large, complex machines found in places like the state health departments, major hospitals and commercial labs. On Monday night, the FDA issued guidance stating that it does not intend to object if companies start offering ""serology"" tests, which can infer the presence of COVID-19 by detecting specific blood cells produced in response to the virus. 4:29 p.m.: The LCBO is reducing its hours following the province's state of emergency declaration.

The federal Liberal government says the exemption for U.S. citizens is to accommodate those people who live and work on opposite sides of the Canada-U.S. border.

But the growing number of locally transmitted cases brings a new level of danger.

She says there are also a number of cases in several provinces connected to a large dental conference that took place in Vancouver.

She encourages Canadians to keep donating blood, and noted that Canadian Blood Services has all the procedures in place to keep people safe. 12:10 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador has announced two more presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the province, bringing the total number of cases to three. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, says the woman and man live within the Labrador-Grenfell Health region, which covers Labrador and part of Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula. The cases are linked to contact with the province's first presumptive case announced on Saturday. Fitzgerald recommended the closure of public spaces including fitness facilities, arenas, bars, performances spaces and said all St. Patrick's Day celebrations scheduled for tonight should be cancelled. 12:07 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the Emergencies Act is a tool the federal government can use to enact measures it would otherwise not be able to enact. He says the Liberal government is looking at other ways to impose new measures without calling a state of emergency. Trudeau also says that with three million Canadians living or travelling abroad at any time, it would not be possible to expect that everyone would be able to come home immediately. Trudeau also says Canada is in a good fiscal position to be able to invest in Canadian individuals and businesses to make sure the country gets through this difficult time and continues to ""prosper and grow"" once this moment is over. 11:52 a.m.: Ontario health officials are confirming the province's first death in a patient with COVID-19.

""We will be making announcements over the next couple of days to demonstrate how we're going to support Canadians, whether it's through E.I. for people who qualify for employment insurance . . . whether it's money to businesses will allow them to keep people on the payroll even though they're staying home,"" Trudeau said. 9:15 a.m.: Toronto mayor John Tory says he fully supports the province's declaration of a state of emergency because it will help all cities protect the health of residents and further prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""I hope the seriousness of this declaration will make it clear to every resident how important their personal actions will be in the coming days,"" Tory said in a statement. ""If people can stay home then stay home and limit your interactions with other people. We know from our medical professionals that engaging in social distancing will protect people's health and the health of their family and their neighbours."" 9:15 a.m.: Quebec political leaders have announced the provincial legislature will be closed until April 21 after today's sitting due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Simon Jolin-Barrette, the government house leader, made the announcement today alongside counterparts from Quebec's other major political parties. Jolin-Barrette says the suspension is to limit the spread of novel coronavirus and to allow legislators to work from home. He says legislature members also need to be available to constituents in their ridings. 8:56 a.m.: Shopping malls will still be allowed to stay open during Ontario's state of emergency for now. But Ontario's medical officer of health Dr. David Williams says that is not being ruled out. 8:50 a.m.: Premier Doug Ford stresses that ""it's absolutely critical to keep the supply chains open.""

Speaking to reporters outside Rideau Cottage on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged Canadians to stay home as much as possible to slow the spread of COVID-19. The prime minister said he understood it can seem like a big ask, but that simple measures like self-isolation and proper handwashing will save Canadian lives. Trudeau said the government will announce tomorrow its financial supports, both for Canadians citizens who have been forced to miss work and for temporarily shuttered businesses. ""We're talking about recalling Parliament briefly to pass legislative measures that will allow us to do things around EI (Employment Insurance), to do things around a number of methods to get money into the pockets of Canadians,"" he said. In an earlier interview with 680 News, Trudeau said the federal government is looking at a ""range of measures,"" including: •Support through EI for those Canadians who qualify; •Direct financial support for Canadians who don't qualify for EI; •Money to businesses to keep employees on the payroll, even if they stay home; •Helping businesses get access to credit and loans; •Help with mortgage payments; •Funnelling cash through the Canada Child Benefit and the GST credit for low-income Canadians. ""We're going to be flowing income supports to millions of Canadians,"" Trudeau told the radio station. ""These sort of things are all on the table in terms of tools we're looking at to help Canadians as quickly as possible get through this time."" With Premier Doug Ford declaring a province-wide state of emergency, Trudeau was pressed on whether the federal government was considering declaring a national emergency. Making that declaration would give Ottawa sweeping powers to directly address the COVID-19 pandemic. But Trudeau said that, at least for now, the federal government has enough power and tools to take significant action – like largely closing the borders to international traffic – without invoking an emergency. ""I can tell you that there haven't been limits, structurally, on the things that we felt we needed to do or need to do,"" Trudeau said. ""It's not just about what it takes to make the declaration, it's what does the declaration actually give us, what are the powers that we don't actually have that we would need,"" he added.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Amid coronavirus fears, all eyes on Canada-U.S. border - especially on West Coast By Alex McKeenVancouver Bureau Wed., March 18, 2020timer4 min. read SURREY, B.C.-If living near the epicentre of the worst COVID-19 outbreak in North America has been surreal to Rebecca Schwartz, making it across the border to Canada was a carefully calculated call. ""My mom is having surgery (in B.C.) - it's not scheduled yet,"" she said after driving from Seattle, Wash., with companion Colin Oswin on Tuesday. ""Even before the prime minister announced travel restrictions, I was anticipating they would close this border."" That hasn't happened yet - and may not, with both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump saying Canadians and Americans can travel across the border despite worsening coronavirus outbreaks in both countries, at least for now. But as B.C.'s battle with coronavirus ramps up, with officials announcing 83 new cases and three additional deaths from coronavirus Tuesday, they also repeated calls for mitigation of travel, particularly through B.C.-Washington border crossings. There are ordinarily 18,000 cars that come into B.C. from Washington state every day. Schwartz and Oswin know they'll have to self isolate for 14 days now that they're in Canada, but it's worth it to know they won't end up on the other side of the border from Schwartz's mother. They've watched how quickly the coronavirus outbreak can disrupt the world around them. One day everyone is working and going to yoga, the next day everything is closed. ""It's surreal; it's like tumbleweed blowing in the street,"" Oswin said. Washington state had the first community outbreak of COVID-19 in North America, at the Life Care Centre nursing home in the outer Seattle suburb of Kirkland. With 1,012 confirmed cases of the disease, and 52 deaths, the state continues to be the North American jurisdiction worst struck by coronavirus. That's why when the prime minister announced widespread restrictions on entries to Canada by foreign nationals Monday, but left the border open to all Americans, B.C. leaders were quick say that's not what they wanted to hear. ""It's our strong view and our strong message that visitors from the United States not come to British Columbia,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Monday. ""Don't come. Because at this moment, that is the wrong thing to do."" Premier John Horgan said the province is pushing the federal government for tighter borders with the U.S. And provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, on the day she declared a public health emergency in B.C. over COVID-19, repeated calls to stem the flow of travellers between Washington State and B.C. Flanked by Dix, she said that doesn't mean a blanket ban for all U.S. citizens entering Canada. ""We have an interconnected economy, interconnected services and goods that move across our borders all the time - some of the essential goods that we need right now move across that border,"" she said. ""What we are requesting and what I agree with is that the border be closed to visitors - people who are coming across the border to visit B.C."" Dr. Annalee Yassi, Canada Research Chair in Global Health at the University of British Columbia, said the unrestricted border with Washington is a ""big worry."" ""B.C. is just down the road from one of the worst outbreaks, namely Washington state,"" She said. ""If we are going to implement a travel ban but exclude people coming from hot spots in the U.S., it undermines the credibility of this measure."" Tom Koch, an epidemic expert at the University of British Columbia's geography department, said there are good reasons for maintaining flow through U.S.-Canada border crossings, including cargo and to process returning Canadians. ""Canada-U.S. borders are distinct from all others given the physical proximity and the close exchanges between both countries,"" Koch said. ""So full closure, unless where it is made exigent, would be politically and economically difficult.""

And it's likely public health warnings to avoid travel have also decreased traffic into Canada already, he said. The Canada Border Services Agency on Tuesday said it could not provide any information on flow of people through Canada-U.S. borders until next week due to a large volume of requests for information. But at the Peace Arch border crossing in Surrey, one of the country's busiest land border crossings, there were Tuesday only two lanes of cars lined up to enter Canada, with no more than three cars in each lane at a time. Most of the cars entering Surrey had B.C. licence plates - Canadian citizens and residents coming home. And travellers from the U.S., like Schwartz and Oswin, said they weren't coming in for travel, but to reunite with family. Jeff St. Mary from Ridgefield, Wash., got a call from his daughter, Rebecca, who studies at UBC in Vancouver this week. She asked for a ride home in case travel restrictions between the countries ramp up, so he drove to the border. ""Washington is the worst in the whole country,"" for coronavirus, St. Mary said after crossing the border. ""We normally stop to have dinner when we do this drive at a restaurant or hotel - not today. Especially the Seattle area - you just don't know how many cases are really out there."" He doesn't think the U.S. or Canada should close their borders though. ""There are so many who need to go back and forth,"" he said.

Trudeau told reporters Wednesday that his government and the Trump administration are trying to ensure trade is not disrupted as the two countries temporarily halt non-essential travel across the border. Trudeau said he spoke to President Donald Trump on Wednesday morning to ""ensure the smooth flow of goods and essential materials and medication across the border."" ""We will work in close collaboration in an ongoing basis to make sure that continues,"" Trudeau said. ""These measures will last in place as long as we feel that they need to last."" Trudeau said Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spoke directly Tuesday, and that by Wednesday morning both countries felt comfortable with taking the extraordinary step as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The border closure will apply to all ""non-essential traffic,"" although details were still scarce early Wednesday as to how that would be defined and the travel ban enforced. After CNN reported Tuesday night that the two countries were in talks to close the border, Trump himself confirmed the decision on Twitter Wednesday morning. ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our northern border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected,"" Trump said on Twitter Wednesday morning. The Canadian government closed the border to all international visitors except U.S. citizens Monday, but federal and provincial authorities encouraged citizens of both countries to avoid non-essential travel Tuesday. In 2019, some 15 million Americans visited Canada in 2019, according to Statistics Canada. In January alone, Canada's imports and exports with the U.S. totalled nearly $70 billion. Yet leaving the border open to Americans sparked worries it was encouraging the spread of COVID-19, particularly in British Columbia, where neighbouring Washington state is one of the hardest hit places in the U.S. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the border issue was being discussed ""in great detail"" at a special COVID-19 cabinet committee meeting in Ottawa on Tuesday. ""We are talking with business, we are talking with labour, we are talking with the provinces,"" Freeland said, noting that any action on the Canada-U.S. border would require great care given the volume of two-way trade. ""Particular care needs to be taken just because that border is a lifeline,"" Freeland told reporters. ""We get our groceries thanks to truckers who drive back and forth across that border. Very urgently needed medical supplies and medicines go back and forth across that border. And essential workers go across that border every day.""

At the time of our departure, we were congratulating ourselves on having dodged the bullet of the predicted brutal winter and we would now avoid the hateful late February and early March weather. I've always thought of this period as the worst of our winters. Even before we arrived in Florida, we were basking in the euphoric glow of a bulging retirement portfolio and planned to live it large during what promised to be the perfect get away - what could go wrong, eh? Obviously, a lot! As I write this piece, we are entering our second week of isolation from friends and family and we've had lots of time to reflect on our current lot in life. Our vacation was cut short, we miss being with our kids and grandkids; we face a serious threat to our health and the ""unrealistic exuberance"" of the stock market has evaporated. We're concerned that we might contact the virus; more than somewhat poorer and don't know when we might be able to resume a normal life. I'm sure lots of our senior brothers and sisters are feeling very much the same, but we can now put some perspective on our collective situation. Those of us lucky enough to be born in the '40s and raised in the utopian '50s have been spared the turbulent times of the past century. Born after the Great Depression; too late to serve in the Second World War or the Korean ""police action"" and lucky enough to live in a country that avoided involvement in the other major conflicts of our times, we've pretty well sailed through our lives unscathed by world events. This is not to minimize the sacrifices made by the many Canadians who lost their lives in Afghanistan or in other ""peace keeping"" initiatives during this period, but to emphasize how blessed our generation has been. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered that rosy picture - we and those older than us constitute the demographic group that will be most severely affected, even killed by this virus. The good news for us is that our children and our children's children appear to be far less likely to become seriously ill and we are thankful for that blessing. The extent to which we've been sheltered from life-changing events makes this unfolding crisis all the more shocking to a generation that had it all. We watched the recent stories of greed and panic in grocery markets in disbelief. We've been repeatedly warned that the veneer of our civilization is thin, but can it be this fragile? One wonders how long it would take for our entire social structure to crumble in a more serious scenario. To put things in perspective, we would all benefit greatly from comparing our situation with that of the millions of refugees around the world either living in camps or on the move in an attempt to find sustenance and security for their families. Where would toilet paper rank in their list of basic needs? This is the first real challenge our privileged society has faced and while our response won't be tabulated and reported on an individual basis, we will all remember how morally and socially responsibly we acted during this unsettling time.

A police spokesperson confirmed to the Star late Wednesday that a civilian member tested positive for the disease. ""We have been actively working with the appropriate public health authorities who are conducting an in-depth investigation related to the individual and their contacts,"" said Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray. ""This member does not work in a public-facing role within the Service."" 9:30 p.m.: There are 705 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada. Here are the numbers by province: Ontario: 214 (including 1 death) 5 resolved; British Columbia: 231 confirmed (including 7 deaths) 5 resolved; Alberta: 94 confirmed; Quebec: 94 confirmed (including 1 death); Canadians quarantined at CFB Trenton: 9 confirmed; Manitoba: 13 confirmed, 4 presumptive; New Brunswick: 2 confirmed, 9 presumptive; Saskatchewan: 2 confirmed, 14 presumptive; Nova Scotia: 3 confirmed, 9 resumptive; Prince Edward Island: 1 confirmed; Newfoundland and Labrador: 3 presumptive. 9:20 p.m.: The federal government is lifting COVID-19 travel restrictions on migrant farm workers coming to Canada, relieving industry fears that the national response to the pandemic could threaten the nation's food supply. In an email to Ontario's agricultural sector, obtained by The St. Catharines Standard, Ernie Hardeman, Ontario's minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs, said the workers will not face the same restrictions placed on other travellers to Canada. ""Temporary foreign workers will be exempt from travel restrictions ... great news for our agriculture sector,"" Hardeman wrote in the Wednesday email. Hardeman's email references a Wednesday announcement by federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, but Ottawa did not publicly disclose the plans. Federal sources told The Standard that while Ottawa intends to let the workers come to Canada, Hardeman's email ""jumped the gun"" as several details have yet to be determined. According to federal sources familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Ottawa needs to finalize negotiations with the United States because most of those workers come from Mexico and Central America and will likely cross American borders to reach Canada. 9:05 p.m.: New Zealand's government has advised citizens not to travel overseas due to the coronavirus and said those already offshore should consider coming home immediately. ""We are raising our travel advice to the highest level: do not travel,"" Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement. ""This is the first time the New Zealand government has advised New Zealanders against traveling anywhere overseas. That reflects the seriousness of the situation we are facing with COVID-19."" Peters also urged all New Zealanders currently travelling overseas to consider returning home immediately. ""Borders are closing. You may not be able to return to New Zealand when you had planned to."" 8:54 p.m.: Playboy magazine has halted its print edition in North America, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as one reason. Playboy Enterprises Inc. CEO Ben Kohn posted the corporation's reason for discontinuing the print magazine launched by Hugh Hefner in 1953 in a statement posted Wednesday on medium.com: ""Last week, as the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic to content production and the supply chain became clearer and clearer, we were forced to accelerate a conversation we've been having internally: the question of how to transform our U.S. print product to better suit what consumers want today,"" he wrote. Kohn said the magazine's spring 2020 issue now reaching newsstands will be the last for now, though special print editions are a part of Playboy's future. The company that gained fame through the men's magazine and its racy pictorials will continue to be an online presence and an important brand for merchandise, he stated. 8:26 p.m.: Alberta is launching measures to help people stay financially afloat during the COVID-19 crisis, including $50 million right away for those self-isolating. Premier Jason Kenney says the money equals $573 for each person who meets the criteria for self-isolation, and is meant to be a bridge equivalent to an employment insurance payment until new federal aid begins April 1. It was one of a range of measures announced by Kenney on Wednesday, including extension of tax deadlines, delays in paying utility bills, loan payment deferrals and more capital for small business owners. Alberta reported 22 new cases of novel coronavirus on Wednesday to bring the total to 119 and the national total to 727 as of 8:20 p.m. EDT. 7:54 p.m.: Dozens of crew members and passengers aboard the Costa Luminosa cruise ship are recorded as sick as the ship nears France in hopes of docking there Thursday, according to ship logs obtained by the Miami Herald. The cruise ship, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corporation, has left three people diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in two countries - Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands - since it departed Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Feb. 24. The cruise was originally supposed to end in Venice, Italy, on March 25 but is now scheduled to dock in Marseilles on Thursday after bypassing several ports. Passengers and crew members on board say they are nervous about what will happen when they arrive in France. President Emanuel Macron announced a 15-day lockdown of the country on Tuesday prohibiting all nonessential outings. At least 24 crew members on board the ship are classified as sick and are isolated, according to ship logs obtained by the Herald, and at least 50 passengers are classified as sick, or are roommates of passengers who are classified as sick. There are currently 1,427 passengers on board. 6:56 p.m.: The Canadian Press calculates that there are now 705 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada. British Columbia, which announced a state of emergency on Wednesday, leads with 231 confirmed (including 7 deaths, 5 resolved) after 45 new cases were announced Wednesday afternoon. Other provincial totals as of 6:45 p.m.: Ontario: 214 confirmed (including 1 death and 5 resolved); Alberta: 97 confirmed; Quebec: 94 confirmed (including 1 deaths); Manitoba: 13 confirmed, 4 presumptive; Saskatchewan: 2 confirmed, 14 presumptive; Nova Scotia: 3 confirmed, 9 presumptive; New Brunswick: 2 confirmed, 9 presumptive; Canadians quarantined at CFB Trenton: 9 confirmed; Newfoundland and Labrador: No confirmed cases, 3 presumptive; Prince Edward Island: 1 confirmed. 6:34 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador declared a public health emergency Wednesday, making previous recommendations from the province's chief medical officer of health enforceable by law. Under the order, businesses including bars, cinemas, theatres, gyms and arenas must close effective immediately and gatherings of more than 50 people are not permitted. Travellers returning from international travel are ordered to self-isolate for 14 days. Health Minister John Haggie said individuals breaching the orders could be fined between $500 and $2,500 and could face jail sentences of up to six months. Possible fines for corporations range up to $50,000. Haggie said the order is for two weeks but he anticipates the order will be renewed ""multiple times."" 6:31 p.m.: As the U.S. shortage of face masks becomes severe, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nurses can use bandanas and scarves as makeshift masks when caring for COVID-19 patients - although it's unclear whether they would protect medical workers. The CDC says that option should be used ""as a last resort"" and only when the hospital nearly depletes its supply and experiences a crush of COVID-19 patients, reaching ""crisis capacity."" The CDC acknowledges that its recommendations are out of step with standards of care in the United States. Nurses and other health care providers can ""use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19,"" the CDC website now reads. The agency says in the next sentence that the homemade masks' capability to protect health care providers against the coronavirus-caused disease ""is unknown."" 6:30 p.m.: Manitoba has announced two new cases of COVID-19. That brings the total to 17 - including four that are still presumptive. The new cases are a woman in her 50s and a man in his 70s who both live in Winnipeg. Officials say they appear to be travel-related. 6:12 p.m.: Ontario announced two more COVID-19 cases on Wednesday afternoon, bringing its daily total to 25 and the overall provincial total to 214. The two new cases were a man in his 50s from the Niagara region and a woman in her 80s from Chatham-Kent; both had been travelling internationally and that is presumed to be the source of their illness. 5:25 p.m.: The TTC has reversed its prohibition against its employees wearing face masks during the COVID-19 outbreak, and will now let workers who wish to use the devices do so. The transit agency had previously rejected calls to let workers who have daily contact with hundreds of passengers to wear the masks, arguing that Toronto Public Health officials have advised against healthy people doing so because they may increase the risk of infection, ""as they can lead to individuals touching their face more often than necessary."" But on Wednesday the agency issued a news release saying ""TTC employees who choose to wear their own masks while working will be permitted"" to use them. 5:41 p.m.: The Metro grocery retailer announced Wednesday that its Metro and Food Basics chains in Ontario, as well as Metro Plus, Super C, and Marche Richelieu banners in Quebec, will cut their hours, opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m. daily - an hour or two earlier than is usual in most Toronto locations. ""This measure will allow our teams to restock the stores, apply the hygiene measures in effect and, of course, give our employees the chance to rest during this hectic period,"" spokeswoman Marie-Claude Bacon wrote in an email. Grocery stores are considered an essential service at this time and expected to remain open, whereas non-essential services, like clothing retailers, have been closing their doors to help prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Adonis supermarkets will close one hour earlier on weekends, while Quebec's The Premiere Moisson bakeries will close at 6 p.m. daily. 5:24 p.m.: Ontario's Beer Store is reducing hours at its more than 400 stores and pausing recycling until March 31. The chain's locations will be open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday, as of March 19. (Stores that operate from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. are unaffected.) Sunday hours remain unchanged. The Beer Store says it's also suspending the return of empty bottles and cans effective March 19, through to March 31. The chain noted in a news release that its Beer Xpress home delivery and in-store pick up are available in select communities, including most of the GTA. 5:19 p.m.: Toyota has told the Star's Sara Mojtehedzadeh that it is temporarily suspending manufacturing across North America in response to the outbreak, as both a health precaution and to reflect anticipated decline in demand. Manufacturing facilities will be closed from March 23-24, resuming production on March 25, Toyota says. The company says it will conduct a thorough cleaning at all of manufacturing facilities during the shutdown, and let employees prepare/adjust family plans. 5:00 p.m.: Saskatchewan has declared a provincial state of emergency to give it broader powers to address the COVID-19 pandemic, shortly after it announced that its number of cases had doubled from 8 to 16. The government has prohibited public gatherings of more than 50 people. Gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls are ordered to close until further notice. The Northwest Territories' health minister, meanwhile, has declared a public health emergency, joining the other two territories although none have any confirmed cases of COVID-19. 4:48 p.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases in Canada, via the Canadian Press as of 4:10 p.m.: There are 655 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada (594 confirmed, 9 deaths, 10 resolved, 42 presumptive). Ontario: 212 confirmed (including 1 death, 5 resolved). British Columbia: 186 confirmed (including 7 deaths, 5 resolved. Alberta: 97 confirme. Quebec: 94 confirmed (including 1 death. Saskatchewan: 2 confirmed, 14 presumptive. Manitoba: 8 confirmed, 7 presumptive. Nova Scotia: 3 confirmed, 9 presumptive. New Brunswick: 2 confirmed, 9 presumptive. Canadians quarantined at CFB Trenton: 8 confirmed. Newfoundland and Labrador: No confirmed cases, 3 presumptive. Prince Edward Island: 1 confirmed. The Territories: No confirmed cases. 4:43 p.m.: North American stock indexes plunged, crude oil prices dropped more than 20 per cent and the loonie fell to a five-year low as COVID-19 fears continued to rattle markets.

Trump described himself as a ""wartime president"" as virus cases surged and the markets fell, and he took a series of extraordinary steps to steady a battered nation, its day-to-day life fundamentally altered.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Dr. Simon Sherry, a clinical psychologist and professor in psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University, believes the first steps are to avoid hysteria, look rationally at the situation and spread that rationality to others. ""Right now there's a sort of digital distortion that's occurring whereby people are being inundated with negative information,"" he said. ""Every headline and every click is feeding a steady diet of panic and anxiety to us. So people need to consider the idea of there being too much information and to limit their exposure to things like social media, because in social media in particular, panic sells."" ""Caution is indicated here, but panic is not."" ""Just like a virus can be spread from one person to another, fear can be spread from one person to another. So there's such a thing as emotional contagion. If all you're doing is talking about COVID-19, you become a source of transmission of fear yourself."" Steve Joordens, professor of psychology at University of Toronto, has some recommendations to help quell those fears, and weather the storm, including limiting news consumption to a couple of hours a day, and never right before sleeping. Instead, he suggests watching a light sitcom, or a mindless reality show, or even karaoke with the family before bed. In addition, he suggests listening to guided relaxation recordings as you go to sleep. The idea is to teach your body how to relax again, and re-enter that mellower ""rest-and-digest"" mode. ""I'm recommending to people just before they go to bed, put one of these things on. It'll help you sleep better, because you'll be relaxed before bed,"" he said. ""And if you do this every night, you can start to have this as a skill that you just carry around with you in your back pocket.""

Taking a cue from similar initiatives in other parts of the coronavirus-affected world, including Italy and Spain, some Canadian families have started displaying their children's drawings of rainbows and other cheery images in the windows of their home to entertain neighbours and show solidarity. Lee-Ann Webber of Stoney Creek, Ont., started the Facebook and Instagram accounts ""Brighten Our World With Art"" this week to encourage parents and their kids to draw pictures of a designated theme every other day and post them in their window. The themes include rainbows, flowers, animals and encouraging words. She's also asking families to walk around the area — practising safe social distancing, of course — to hunt for the displays. Adults without kids can also participate, she stresses. ""It's helping parents with the isolation and giving their child something to do,"" says Webber, who owns a cleaning and organizing company and has two children. Several other neighbourhoods throughout Canada are striking up similar ""window walks"" organized on social media. Some communities are also encouraging residents to fire up their Christmas lights so they're visible from the street to combat feelings of gloom and anxiety amid the outbreak. Music is also starting to fill the open air. On Wednesday night, the downtown Toronto condo community CityPlace encouraged residents to go to their balconies and windows at a designated time to shout out to neighbours, flicker lights and play music for a couple of minutes. One member of the neighbourhood's Facebook group posted a video of themselves playing the song ""I Will Survive"" on a balcony as part of the event. And on Tuesday, Toronto mezzo-soprano Julie Nesrallah took to her balcony to sing ""O sole mio"" to ""bring a little sparkle"" to her neighbours and passersby. The host of CBC Radio's classical music program ""Tempo"" says she was inspired by a recent video of a tenor in Italy singing to his neighbours from his balcony. She gave some neighbours a heads up before she nervously stepped out from days of isolation and onto the balcony in the chilly temperatures at sunset and ""let it rip."" She wore a gown and fancy necklace, with her hair and makeup done — as if she were onstage. Her boyfriend filmed the performance, which has gone viral on social media and got some honks from cars below as well as a shout of ""Brava"" from a neighbour. Nesrallah is now considering doing a second balcony performance, and has inspired a girlfriend of hers who's also a singer to do the same. ""I'm hoping that after this is all over, people who are at home and who are listening to artists they might not have time to listen to otherwise will become infected by their passion,"" Nesrallah says. ""And when it is all over, concert-going and taking in live music will be the thing that everybody is just itching to do because we've all been stuck behind closed doors for so long."" Scores of neighbourly posts are cropping up on social media all over the country, offering everything from grocery deliveries to rides and friendly check-ins. Clay Charters, president and CEO of the Santa Claus Parade in Toronto, plans to go around his Etobicoke neighbourhood with photographer/neighbour Jeremy Sale in the coming days to shoot portraits of families on their porches and front steps while keeping a safe social distance. The ""Pictures of the Porch"" project, which families are connecting to via Facebook, is intended to document how residents are spending their time and staying connected during this uneasy period. ""It's a very tight-knit community and had been prior to this, and there's a great deal of involvement and socialization,"" says Charters, who is currently working from home with his wife and two young children. ""So this is just a small way to keep us all connected but maybe to also recognize the work that everyone's doing in the community, because they're all making some sacrifices and it will be challenging for some people.""

She's self-isolated thousands of kilometres from home and under a kind of virtual house arrest. On March 13, Michelle, 28, and her boyfriend Patrick were being reassured, up and down, by her travel agency and by the Peruvians that it was safe for them to travel to Cusco, to visit Machu Picchu and other sites in that South American country. ""We were monitoring COVID-19 in both countries (Canada and Peru) and because there weren't as many cases in Peru at the time of our departure we didn't think it would be such an issue."" They had planned the trip in October 2019, when no one had ever heard of COVID-19. Worst-case scenario, they were prepared to go into self-isolation upon returning to Canada. But now they can't get out of Peru. At all. And there's no clear path to changing that any time in the foreseeable future, though many are working feverishly to expedite the return home of many Canadians, trapped in different countries — but especially those stranded in places under military lockdown, namely, Peru, where some 800 Canadians are stuck. ""Two days into our trip on March 16, we woke up at 4:30 a.m. to visit Humantay Lake when we received an email from the travel agency stating the government has cancelled all tourist activity for 15 days and all tourists must remain in their hotels,"" Michelle told The Spectator via email March 21. ""We started researching online to see what we could do and read that the president of Peru was essentially putting the whole country on lockdown and no one could fly in or out of Peru after midnight on March 16th. We were looking to book flights to come home but with such little warning about the ban it made it very difficult to find any way out of the country. Since the ban literally happened overnight we were completely shocked. At that point we moved to a different hotel with a restaurant and a nearby grocery store and pharmacy so we would be able to get the essential items needed."" She says the situation of the Canadians and others there is eerie, with face masks being required for people entering grocery stores, with only one person per family being even allowed to leave their homes, between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. She and Patrick brought face masks with them as a precaution but many Canadians there don't have any and consequently can't get groceries. The Canadians have formed a Facebook group, about 800 or 900 strong, and are trying both to get and to share information, both from the Canadian embassy and government officials, says Michelle, who lives on the east Mountain and works at a child care centre in Hannon as an early childhood educator. ""All we can do is live day by day and not get our hopes up too high in case we are the citizens that might not be able to get home. We've seen a lot of negative comments about us just wanting a free ride home but that's not the case, at this point we're all willing to pay whatever it takes to just go home."" She says that emotionally it has been stressful and frustrating. ""We've been getting different answers to the same questions, which is disheartening but all we can do is stay strong and remain hopeful."" She is grateful that she's not alone. She has her boyfriend there that she can talk to and even potentially see her family, especially mother Laurie, using WhatsApp. And that she's symptom-free. ""We're trying to do everything we can here,"" says Michelle's mother Laurie Bingham, who also lives in Hamilton. ""Contacting our MPs and MPPs and the emergency consular service."" But answers are sparse. ""She really wants to come home. We're all feeling so helpless."" Prime Minster Justin Trudeau said Sunday Canada is working with governments to get stranded Canadians home but he needs assurances that planes sent to rescue them can land and take off. He said the government will help as many of the stranded as it can but he has also said it might not be able to get everyone home quickly.

Canadian snowbirds face difficult questions amid COVID-19 pandemic By Kevin McGranStaff Reporter Toronto Star Sun., March 22, 2020timer5 min. read Some Canadians are racing to get home before their insurance expires, others remain stranded in remote locales, some feel abandoned by airlines, and still others are wondering how safe the roads, planes and airports will be as they return. ""There are a lot of things happening right now,"" says Evan Rachkovsky, director of communications and research for the Canadian Snowbirds Association. ""We've been hearing stories of people that having some issues finding their way back. ""There's a lot of misinformation out there. We've been doing this, we've been providing members with updated advisories with the latest information, latest details that are coming out of the Government of Canada, and then obviously telling them to heed the advice of the federal government to return home as soon as it is feasible. ""Most of all, people just want good information."" The travel issues surrounding Canadians trying to get home amid the COVID-19 pandemic are endless. Questions mount, and answers - so far as there are any - seem empty. Here are some of the issues Canada's returning snowbirds are facing: A race with their health insurance The moment Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called on Canadians overseas to come home on March 14, a rider in the small print for most out-of-country insurance holders kicked in. Some travellers were told they had 10 days - until March 23 - to get back. If they weren't home by that dare, then - in most cases - if they got sick from the coronavirus, they would not be covered. The Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada is urging all travellers to check with their individual insurance companies. ""The industry would echo the Canadian government's advice that it is now time to come home,"" said Will McAleer, the travel association's executive director. ""Travellers are strongly encouraged to take all actions to return to Canada as soon as possible. ""By delaying return, transportation options could become even more limited or non-existent and will put travellers at greater risk staying abroad."" Upon hearing Trudeau's pronouncement, Silvia Grava and her husband booked tickets on WestJet to come home from Merida, Mexico. Hours later, WestJet cancelled that flight. ""My husband and I are Canadian citizens stuck in Merida, Mexico right now because WestJet sold us tickets just hours before their press release (to cancel flights),"" she said. ""They did not get notify us of the cancellation, and when I called them, they informed me there are no more flights from our location,"" she said. Grava is exploring Mexican airlines to get home. WestJet spokeswoman Morgan Bell was sympathetic, but pleaded patience. ""We are seeing a lot of these notes and are working as fast as possible on our plans to bring Canadians home,"" said Bell. ""We continue to add extra flights day by day as we determine the needs of WestJet and WestJet Vacation guests as well as other Canadians across various destinations."" Refund issues It's not just WestJet, Air Canada's policies have befuddled its customers. Ashley Dillard, of Labrador, needs to cancel a family vacation to Florida in April. He had booked four tickets for himself, his wife and his two sons through travel agent Carlson Wagonlit at a total cost of $6,298.68; the airline is offering him a credit for the full amount - good for 24 months - or a refund of merely $297.12. Travel insurance is a possibility, but he'd lose about 25 per cent. ""Air Canada has $6,000 of my money, which is an awful lot of money,"" he said. ""What happens when we all emerge from this?"" he asked. ""Because how can they continue business under the weight of all this money owing?"" Emails and other messages to Air Canada were not returned. The airline's website asks for ""patience and understanding during these times of rapid change."" Fly or drive? Sharon, who asked her last name not be used, fretted for a good two weeks about how to get her 95-year-old father home from his winter home in Bradenton, Fla. She worries planes aren't a good idea - packed with people who may have the virus without knowing it. But driving? With a 95-year-old who suffers from arthritis, requiring frequent bathroom stops, plus stops for gas, stops in hotels and motels, stops at restaurants. That doesn't seem like a good idea either. ""It's a question of a whole different set of risks in each case,"" said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. ""So I think this kind of understanding that and then making a decision that seems less frightening. I can't say that one is way better than the other."" Ultimately, the airlines made the choice, telling her the only flight available for her leaves Wednesday, from Sarasota to Toronto.

I don't want him to die from this,"" said Sharon. ""I pray we are both healthy from the return travels."" A border closed to ""non-essential"" travel The ban on non-essential travel across the border threw Donna Steeves's travel plans into disarray. Steeves, of Orillia, has lung issues. She would like to come home as soon as possible, but she needs help. Her boyfriend was going down on Wednesday and they would drive home together, but his passage was denied because the U.S. border authorities deemed his travel to be non-essential travel. (Canadians returning to Canada won't have that issue.) In Bradenton, Fla., she's heard stories of looting - although no reliable media outlets have reported that - and she said she's worried state prisons will release prisoners to help stop the spread of coronavirus. Flying is not for her. She might do it, but she's hoping she can hop a ride back to Ontario with a fellow Canadian. ""For me to go by myself to go back to Canada - no way. I'm scared,"" said Steeves. ""I'd be terrified to do that."" Landing in Toronto The prospect of returning to Canada through a busy airport raises other fears. At Pearson, things started off well for Tony Clift when Air Transat issued all passengers a mask as they exited a flight from Portugal. But his confidence in the system didn't last, especially when the customs kiosk needed to take his picture. ""They tell you to wear the mask, and you have to wear it in customs,"" said Clift, of Burlington. ""But then when you get to the machine you have to take the mask off. Otherwise, the machine doesn't work. It can't take a photograph with the mask on. So that was a bit odd."" There were other issues, too. There was no segregation of flights. And there didn't seem to be any thought given to social-distancing. ""You're just there, with everybody scrambling together to use these kiosks,"" said Clift. The operators of the airport did not respond to requests for interviews about the crowd at customs, where returning passengers from all over the world converge. Then the idea of simply being asked if your sick, and being asked to promise to self-isolate for 14 days, didn't leave him with any confidence in the system. ""It was all very casual.""

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating.

We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough.

""We're disappointed, it's upsetting (and) obviously we would prefer to be getting married on Saturday,"" said Smith, who cried when she got the news. ""At the same time, it's so understandable,"" she said, adding if the venue hadn't called Sunday morning to reschedule she and Conforzi would have made the decision to do so. St. Marys Golf and Country Club contacted the couple shortly after a case of COVID -19 was announced in the Town of St. Marys over the weekend. The club made the decision to close until the end of the month. ""Naturally our business is one that involves larger gatherings, so we felt like it was socially responsible for us to make that decision,"" said Ashton Staffen, director of special events at the club. Smith and Conforzi's wedding is the only one at the club that has been affected by the closure. ""It was obviously a very difficult phone call for all of us,"" said Matt Staffen, the club's general manager. ""We're a family business and we understand this is to them, at this point, the most important day of their lives."" Staff members were able to work with the couple and the majority of their vendors to quickly reschedule the wedding to a weekend in June. When Smith and Conforzi called their nearly 100 guests to tell them the news, about half said they weren't even sure they would have attended the wedding anyway over concerns with the virus. ""For the health of our family and the families of our vendors and our venues, it was 100 per cent the right call,"" said Smith. Cautionary measures have also been taken at Kitchener wedding venue Hacienda Sarria. Staff were working Monday morning to reschedule about ten weddings booked through the end of April, said Leah Mackie, director of operations. Waterloo photographer Lindsay Coulter has also been affected. She had one March wedding postponed and expects another two scheduled for early April to also be put off. Coulter said spring tends to be a slower season for weddings. ""If this had happened in July, I think it would have been definitely a different impact,"" she said, adding if the situation continues into the summer months couples may have to consider rescheduling their weddings to weekdays. While Smith isn't happy that her wedding had to be postponed, she understands it's nobody's fault. ""I think it's so important for everyone to just have grace through all of this.""

The City of Windsor and the County of Essex are asking anyone with surplus N95 and surgical masks, along with gowns, nitrile gloves, battery-operated thermometers, hand sanitizer, wipes and respirators. ""We foresee a shortage and that's why we're acting now, because the folks at the hospital are indicating to us they've never been in this position before where they have supplies looking like they can run out,"" Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens said. He said the city will essentially become a distribution centre for supplies, which will go to hospitals, paramedics, police and others on the front line. ""We don't want to get to the point where it's a dire situation, we want to act on it before that point and that's exactly what we're doing now,"" Dilkens said. The city is using its call centre to help organize the effort and city workers will be sent out to collect the gear, he said. Dilkens called the situation critical, but not dire. ""The fact we're doing a community call for personal protective equipment should underscore the importance that everyone is hearing in terms of taking precautions against COVID-19,"" Dilkens said. ""Do not play fast and loose — take this very, very seriously, stay safe and stay well, and most importantly stay home."" A Toronto hospital is also accepting donations of face masks and other protective gear from members of the public in an effort to ward off an impending shortage. The equipment drive at Michael Garron Hospital came a day after two Ontario medical associations sounded the alarm about the supply of N95 and surgical masks. The N95 respirator masks are able to filter out tiny particles and surgical masks can help contain coughs. The east Toronto hospital is home to a dedicated COVID-19 assessment centre. The Ontario Medical Association and the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario said there is a large stockpile of the masks that have expired but should still be used in lower-risk areas. The associations are also calling on anyone with masks not currently being used to hand them over so they can be used by health workers. They specifically called on educational institutions and dental workers to repurpose their supplies. The federal government has said it's secured millions more masks, which should be arriving shortly, but there's still concern that won't be enough. Meanwhile, EllisDon, one of Canada's largest construction companies, began looking over the weekend for protective gear to donate.

Michael Bryant, executive director and general counsel for the civil-rights group, on Sunday appealed to federal Attorney General David Lametti to act. ""In a nutshell, a public health approach would necessitate that the releasable be released (and) that detention be a measure of last resort,"" Bryant wrote in a three-page letter to the justice minister obtained by the Star. ""For those convicted, existing legal tools could be accessed to reduce the prison population (and immigration detention) through conditional releases, compassionate releases, and other discretionary measures,"" he continued. ""Every release from confinement will alleviate overcrowding, avoid the spread of infection when the virus reaches penal institutions, and protect inmates, correctional officers, and the innocent families and communities to which detainees and inmates will return."" Bryant, who was Ontario attorney general when the provincial Emergency Management and Preparedness Act was updated after the 2003 SARS outbreak, said extraordinary measures must be taken during the health crisis. ""For the presumed innocent, pre-trial, quasi-judicial discretion ought to be exercised so as to drop charges where it is in the public interest, which includes the public health issues raised by this pandemic,"" he wrote. The veteran lawyer added that ""the 'public interest' can be invoked to justify the liberation of a defendant, but not to justify the laying of a charge or continuation of a prosecution, absent a reasonable prospect of conviction."" He also said ""all police and prosecutors should be encouraged, with support from respective governments, to take into account public health goals, and exercise their discretionary authority"" by releasing ""those charged at the scene"" with less serious offences. As well, Bryant implored Lametti to provide ""emergency funding of provincial legal aid services"" so those charged are not stuck in limbo. ""Legal Aid Ontario, for example, dispatched duty counsel and funded defence counsel to assist with the disposition of charges and judicial interim releases this past week in Ontario, thereby permitting the release of over 1,000 in custody,"" he noted. Bryant also asked Ottawa to ensure that there continues to be ""intergovernmental transparency of legal orders"" so Canadians are not left in the dark about the actions being taken the various levels of government. ""Regarding access to information, during the coronavirus response, at least, the executive branch must better align itself with the legislative and judicial branches of the state,"" he said. ""A judicial decision is made public immediately upon being rendered. The same is true of legislative action. The same is not true of cabinet orders. While political communication of an executive decision receives great attention before and after it's made, the same cannot be said for the disclosure of legal orders."" On Saturday, Premier Doug Ford acknowledged there are concerns about conditions inside provincial jails during the pandemic. ""Right now, I know our number one priority … is to take care of our correctional service guards,"" Ford said at Queen's Park. ""They're out there. They're on the frontline making sure that everything safe in the jails across this province,"" he said, adding Solicitor General Sylvia Jones is ""making sure there's that there's a plan"" to keep the jails safe. Ontario Public Service Employees' Union president Warren (Smokey) Thomas, who represents provincial jail guards, said Jones and her officials need to move quickly. ""This threat needs to be nipped in the bud before it gets out of hand,"" said Thomas.

""Our correctional facilities were already under enormous pressure and strain long before COVID-19 came along and this virus could bring complete mayhem if it is not kept in check.

Meanwhile, from the other side of the world's longest undefended border, now stridently defended against vacationers and bargain-hunters, Canada watches, and waits. Trump's thinking, as evidenced by his Twitter feed and recent public remarks, is on a collision course with the best advice of public health experts, including the World Health Organization, which warned Tuesday that the U.S., with more than 50,000 active cases, could well be the outbreak's next major focal point. And yet, ""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" Trump told a Fox News town hall, after tweeting earlier in the day that Americans ought to be able to go to work and practice social distancing at the same time. That sentiment, combined with an earnest effort on Capitol Hill by Democrats and Republicans alike to reach an agreement on a proposed $2-trillion U.S. stimulus package, cheered investors for the first time in weeks, adding more than 1,500 points to the Dow Jones index. Graphs illustrating the spread of the virus, however, were going in the same direction: on Monday, there were more than 10,000 new cases in the U.S., with 140 deaths, while the global total surpassed 300,000 cases - with 100,000 of those coming in just the last four days. In Ottawa, his own self-isolation period winding down without evidence of illness, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clung to diplomatic language when asked about the disconnect between the state of the U.S. outbreak and the evolving messaging out of the White House. For now, the mutual ban on non-essential travel between the two countries will suffice to protect Canadians, Trudeau said. And Canada will continue to follow science-based advice, which means no end soon to the requirements of social distancing: stringent and frequent hand-washing, staying home, avoiding groups of people and steering two metres clear of everyone. But the prime minister also made it clear that Canada is watching closely. ""We are braced for a broad range of scenarios,"" he said. ""As the situation evolves, we will be ready to shift our posture with that."" In New York, currently the largest viral hot zone in the U.S. with more than 25,000 active cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo painted a bleak picture of the coming days and weeks, billing his state's worsening plight as a window into America's future. The infection rate in New York has doubled in the last three days, said Cuomo, who urged the White House to keep working on finding a strategy that would resuscitate the U.S. economy without jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak. ""No American is going to say, 'Accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,'"" he said. ""Job 1 has to be save lives. That has to be the priority."" Trump, however, has a famously binary way of seeing the world. ""He's not a rheostat,"" said former Canadian ambassador Bruce Heyman. ""He's just an on-off switch."" If the U.S. had a better grasp of the nation's true health, including not only who is sick but who has recovered from the illness, it would be better able to control its response, Heyman said - isolating those known to be sick while reintegrating others back into the workforce and selectively reopening businesses. But a chronic shortage of tests, now compounded by a hospital system that is already past capacity, has made that all but impossible. ""The challenge is, we don't have that information, and so we can't implement that very effectively right now,"" Heyman said. ""When you lack information, I think you have to take the most conservative path."" Trump has never explicitly suggested otherwise. Indeed, his tweet Tuesday promised to watch over American seniors ""protectively and lovingly."" But some of his recent remarks - comparing the outbreak to flu season or the number of deaths on the country's highways, for instance - have prompted questions about whether he grasps the potential human toll. ""We have a very active flu season; more active than most. It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths,"" he said Monday.

That doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody, 'No more driving of cars.' So we have to do things to get our country open."" Speaking from the Rose Garden, he made much the same argument Tuesday on Fox as he promised to reassess the situation in two weeks. ""We'll assess at that time and we'll give it some more time if we need a little more time, but we need to open this country up,"" he said. ""We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought.""

The coronavirus is sweeping everywhere, disordering the world. Economies are cratering, people are being cleaved apart and civil society is being shut inside boxes. This is the biggest thing we have ever seen, most of us. But the most important thing right now is the people who will save us. Most people don't think about life and death much, if we're lucky. Doctors and nurses do, and will have to. And as COVID-19 spreads, the question of whether we have enough protective equipment for them is the most important question facing the country right now. Because it will mean life or death. The true demon in the coronavirus is how contagious it is. Without enough Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE - masks, gowns, gloves, face shields, etc. - health-care workers will be exposed to COVID-19. One in every 12 Italians who contracted the virus was a health-care worker. Fewer doctors and nurses and paramedics and more will mean the system bends further, or breaks faster. It means some will get sick. And that some, as we have seen in Italy and China, will die. The system is already showing early signs of strain. In London, the University Hospital is down to three to five days worth of N95 masks already, after a recent influx of COVID-19 patients burned through the hospital's epidemic stockpile. Health-care workers tell of widespread rationing and even recent thefts; the province advised hospitals to lock up equipment a week ago. It's hard. We must protect the most important people in a pandemic. The virus hides in people and is so hard to diagnose without a test. The system will need as many masks as possible when the waves hit. As one doctor put it, ""The dilemma is we should treat everyone like they're infected, but we don't have the resources to do so."" It's a choice they shouldn't have to make. But here we are. We have to hope supply chains can be boosted by federal and provincial money; that industry can be repurposed as quickly as possible to produce masks, ventilators, whatever it can. We have to hope provincial and federal stockpiles are robust enough, though a source familiar with the federal National Emergency Strategic Stockpile explains it is primarily designed for quick response to smaller disasters than this. What can we do now? We have to protect them. Do you have N95 masks, in a box, unopened? Or even surgical masks? Disposable latex gloves? Medical gowns? Call your local hospital and ask where you can drop them. Governments should figure out dropoff spots and protocols, now. We need to do what we can. In Seattle, some hospitals ran out of N95s and blamed Costco hoarders for it, so they bleached the PAPRs, which are the big plastic head-encasing face shields with oxygen tubes out the back, the ones most people only see in movies. You're not supposed to do that. But in a pandemic, some choices are made for you. In Ottawa, one ER doctor who did not wish to be identified has sourced black gloves from a tattoo shop and asked her father to mail her his old woodworking face shield. It's maybe 40 years old. Hopefully, it becomes a funny story to tell one day, over dinner with friends. We have to protect them. Because when the virus comes, they are the ones who can protect us.

In a Leger poll conducted between Friday and Sunday, 16 per cent of respondents said the crisis was partly blown out of proportion and another four per cent believed it was blown way out of proportion. As well, 16 per cent said the crisis was having no impact on them going out to stores, restaurants or other places; 17 per cent said it was having no impact on the social distance they're keeping from others; and 21 per cent said it was having no impact on visits with friends and family. Nine per cent said they were still planning to let their kids play outside with other children. While the poll suggests the vast majority of Canadians were taking the crisis seriously and abiding by government advice to stay home as much as possible, Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque says the 20 per cent who weren't taking it seriously could jeopardize countrywide efforts to curb the rapid spread of the respiratory virus. ""That 20 per cent of people must go down if we want to collectively achieve the objectives of flattening out the curve,"" Bourque said in a interview, referring to the goal of keeping the number of COVID-19 cases from overwhelming the health care system. The poll, conducted for The Canadian Press, surveyed 1,508 adult Canadians randomly selected from its online panel. Leger's internet-based survey cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples. Various provincial governments have begun threatening to impose hefty fines on individuals and businesses that flout orders to close or keep at least two-metres distance from other people. A number of premiers have expressed outrage over Canadians who congregated in parks and on beaches over the weekend while others held house parties or otherwise socialized in groups beyond their immediate family. There have also been instances of individuals refusing to self-isolate for 14 days after travelling abroad or not abiding by quarantines after testing positive for COVID-19. Bourque said governments have little choice but to crack down when one-fifth of the population does not appear to be taking the crisis seriously. The poll suggests that 18-34-year-olds were most likely to think the crisis is overblown - 27 per cent compared to 14 per cent for those 55 years of age or more. But on all other questions, Bourque said the poll found little difference among age groups, including on the level of fear people are feeling. Forty-one per cent of respondents said they were somewhat afraid of personally contracting the virus; another 16 per cent said they were very afraid. Eighteen per cent said they currently have one or more of the commons symptoms of COVID-19: a cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing and/or a fever. Forty-four per cent said they were somewhat afraid someone in their immediate family will contract the disease; another 26 per cent were very afraid. Only four per cent said they personally know someone who's been diagnosed with the disease. Fifty-six per cent said the crisis was already having an impact on their work, 54 per cent said they were stocking up on food and supplies at home and 47 per cent said it's had an impact on their ability to visit loved ones in hospital or long-term care homes. As well, 48 per cent said the crisis had impacted their retirement savings or other investments, 38 per cent said it's affected their income, 35 per cent their capacity to financially assist other family members, 27 per cent their ability to pay bills and 21 per cent their ability to meet mortgage payments or pay rent. Sixteen per cent said they'd lost their job. Despite the hard hits, respondents signalled a relatively high level of satisfaction with the way governments are responding to the crisis. Sixty-five per cent were very or somewhat satisfied with the federal government's performance, 67 per cent with their municipal governments. That rose to 79 per cent for provincial governments - fuelled by a whopping 94 per cent satisfaction rate in Quebec.

But 23 per cent predicted it will last a few weeks and two per cent said just a few days. For the coming week, 60 per cent said they planned to go grocery shopping, 19 per cent planned to get takeout food from a restaurant, 15 per cent planned to get food delivered, 14 per cent intended to go to a convenience store and 11 per cent to a liquor store - although some provinces have now ordered non-essential businesses to close. Nine per cent said they planned to shop for groceries online, five per cent planned to visit friends and two per cent intended to patronize a restaurant or bar.

As a disease modelling expert, she says the effects of the measures we're taking today to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus may not appear for weeks. But when they do, if effective, they should begin to appear as declines in the new number of cases relative to the days before and, ultimately, no new cases. ""As long as the testing remains consistent, even seeing lower rises or no rises or declines - all of those would be fine,"" said Colijn, who is the Canada 150 research chair in mathematics for evolution, infection and public health at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University. The decline in new cases is crucial to ""flattening the curve,"" once considered math jargon that has become part of everyday language as the public educates itself about the pandemic. When health experts talk about the curve as it relates to COVID-19, they are referring to the number of active cases over time. In a pandemic, the goal is to ensure the peak of the curve falls below the health-care system's capacity to deal with it. But the challenge for both mathematicians and the federal government is a lack of data in some cases - and what Colijn called ""noisy"" data skewed by many factors in others - making it hard to predict the course of the disease in Canada. On Monday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the federal government continues to ask the provinces to release more precise data, and has offered help to do so if their staff levels are stretched. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was going to raise the issues during a call with the premiers Monday evening. Ashleigh Tuite, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto, said graphs circulating that show the potential path of COVID-19 in Canada come with ""huge amounts of uncertainty"" for several reasons. First, we're still learning about disease transmission and behaviour. Second, confirmed cases reflect the recent past, not the present, because of the virus's incubation period. And third, testing protocols have shifted and many people who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 will never be tested, meaning modellers don't have accurate numbers to work with. ""Unfortunately the reality is that the data that we have to basically get a sense of what's happening in terms of disease transmission is quite messy,"" she said. ""So those clean lines you see in the graphs are not really reflective of what we're going to see in reality."" Still, modellers are doing what they can with the data available. In Tuite's models, the worst-case scenario would see about 70 per cent of the Canadian population contract COVID-19. The best-case scenario would be a vaccine, but that's not arriving in the short term. In reality, we're somewhere in the middle, where measures like social distancing and self-isolation will be key to flattening the curve, she said. Shortly after schools were closed in Ontario, Tuite created a model showing social distancing could delay the peak of the epidemic by up to one year and reduce the number of cases in that province by 50 to 60 per cent. ""The delay is important because that gives us time to build capacity"" in the health-care system to deal with COVID-19, she said. ""But even when you have the social distancing, at the peak you still have more cases than the current capacity that we have."" The health-care system's ability to cope with the new coronavirus is also a moving target and the limiting factor with COVID-19 has typically been ventilators and hospital beds. Tuite said she has created models using an estimate of 1,600 ventilators in Ontario, but the number of ventilators can be increased over time. Trudeau announced last week that the government would offer cash to manufacturers that shift their assembly lines from making auto parts, for instance, to ventilators. Modelling accuracy should improve over time, Tuite said. Whether the models are exactly accurate, Tuite, Colijn and others emphasized the importance of sticking to social distancing measures, even if they don't initially appear to work. The incubation period means there will be a delay and relaxing the practice too soon is known to lead to second waves of a virus. ""Social distancing relaxation has been shown to be a reason why there may have been a second wave of SARS and the H1N1 pandemic,"" said Jane Heffernan, director of the centre for disease modelling at York University in Toronto.

""It's really tempting to think, 'OK, we did that for a day or two' and then relax it for a little bit because it's really hard to do,"" Colijn said. ""But I think right now the best thing Canadians can do is really to maintain these social distancing measures and try to flatten that curve out so that we see - even if we still see rises - they are as small as they possibly can be and they're nowhere near where they would have been if we had gone ahead and left everything unchanged.""

Toronto alone could have 260,564 newly unemployed people — translating into an unemployment rate of 12.4 per cent, up from 5.4 per cent in February. Ontario, meanwhile, could have 564,174 newly unemployed people. ""The unemployment rate in March is on track to be the highest in 70 years, and we're only at the beginning of the economic fallout,"" said David Macdonald, the report's author and a senior economist at the CCPA. He said the national unemployment rate, which was 5.9 per cent in February, has likely doubled in the last week. ""You can see pretty quickly how cataclysmic this all is."" Women, low-wage workers and young people have been hardest hit, according to Macdonald's analysis, which found that 13 per cent of all working women in Canada are at risk of layoff, compared to nine per cent of working men. It also found that two out of every five workers making $14/hour or less and one out of every three workers making $14 to $16/hour are at risk of ""immediate"" job loss. By comparison, just one per cent of workers making $40/hour are at risk of losing their job. Youth unemployment is likely to at least double from 10.4 per cent to 25.5 per cent, but could reach as high as 33 per cent. Macdonald used Labour Force Survey data from February to forecast the ""best"" and ""probable"" cases for unemployment rates by identifying workers at the greatest risk of layoff. He focused on the following sectors: retail, food and hospitality; airlines; and culture, sport and recreation. He specifically looked at workers in ""front-line"" occupations, who are most at risk of layoff due to forced closures. He excluded workers in grocery stores and drug stores, which have been allowed to remain open, as well as online retailers. Macdonald did not project how the unemployment rate might be offset by additional hiring in these sectors. He also didn't include layoffs in the auto sector or manufacturing. ""This model is an attempt to get the broad strokes of what happened in the past two weeks,"" he said. ""It's certainly not going to be perfect, but it's trying to get some idea of the scale."" A precise accounting of the economic carnage that has occurred as the country tries to contain the coronavirus won't be known for weeks, but Macdonald said the unemployment rate would rise from 5.9 to 13.9 per cent in his ""probable"" scenario. ""It's shocking, but it's backed by the EI claim data,"" he said. A record one million people filed for employment insurance last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday. ""We've never laid off a million people in Canada in a week and we'll likely hit 1.5 (million) if not more by the end of this month,"" Macdonald said. ""There's just no precedent for this."" More women than men work in retail and food services, Macdonald said, explaining why the unemployment rate projects to be higher for women. ""Men are more likely to work in trades, transport and trucking. Those industries weren't hit immediately, so that's why you're seeing a bit more impact on women than men."" On Wednesday the federal government proposed new legislation for delivering financial assistance to Canadians. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit would provide $2,000 per month, for up to four months, to any workers who lose their income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether or not they're eligible for employment insurance. The government describes it as a ""simpler and more accessible combination"" of the previously announced Emergency Care Benefit and Emergency Support Benefit. Macdonald called Wednesday's announcement a ""critical step toward supporting workers,"" adding that it highlights ""how inadequate and bureaucratic the employment insurance system was in normal times."" His analysis found that 27 per cent of workers at risk of immediate layoff would have been denied EI due to inadequate hours, and more than three-quarters of workers in major cities at risk of being laid off would be better off with the new benefit than they would have been under EI. Macdonald stressed his projections are only for the ""first round"" of layoffs, concerning workers on the ""front lines"" of affected occupations facing the most immediate risk of layoffs.

""If that means for the short term, for the next two to four weeks, there will be loss of some civil liberties in order to protect our most vulnerable, I'm ready to sign up for that,"" said Kevin Smith, president of the University Health Network. He said he is dismayed that people continue to leave their homes and socialize in groups despite public health recommendations not to. ""Based on what we saw on the weekend, people are still not taking seriously the need for physical distancing,"" said Smith, who oversees a hospital corporation that includes Toronto General, Toronto Western and Princess Margaret hospitals, as well as Toronto Rehab. ""So go all the way. The only thing we will regret is what we don't do,"" he continued. Invoking the Emergencies Act would give the federal government sweeping powers, including regulating or prohibiting travel and movement within the country. The legislation was passed in 1988, replacing the War Measures Act. The act would also empower Ottawa to regulate the distribution of essential goods, order people to provide essential services and establish emergency hospitals and shelters, among other things. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that all options are on the table to ensure compliance with public health recommendations. But after speaking to the premiers by phone earlier this week, he said most of them do not think it's necessary ""at this time"" to invoke the act. On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced that the government is imposing mandatary quarantines on travellers returning to Canada. Using her authority under the Quarantine Act, she said all travellers must enter 14 days of isolation. Essential workers, including those who work in health care, are exempted. Those who violate quarantine orders risk fines or jail time. The Quarantine Act only applies to people entering Canada, not to those already in the country. Smith said that invoking such legislation may seem extreme, but so is the threat facing Canadians. ""We are in an extreme situation and we continue to see behaviours that are shocking in terms of the fact that people are willing to take their own degree of high risk. What is unconscionable and unacceptable is that they are forcing that risk on the broader population,"" he said. Canada has reached a tipping point in the epidemic with half of new cases being acquired through community spread, Smith warned. He noted that the spread of the virus is also placing health workers at risk and putting incredible demands on the health system. Hospitals across the country are now gearing up for an expected crush of COVID-19 patients. Dr. Barry Rubin, medical director of the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre at UHN, said work is being done to make more beds available while ensuring patients and staff are kept safe. At the same time, the hospital is monitoring international developments and responding to new evidence and directives.

By Christine SismondoContributing Columnist Tue., March 24, 2020timer3 min. read For the past week, I've been fighting something off. Or maybe it's seasonal allergies? Hard to say. You know the feeling: A little hazy, some sniffles, a froggy feeling in the throat. I knew it probably wasn't COVID-19 but, you know, I did have a fleeting thought. As Miss Hoover said in the second season of The Simpsons, ""Sometimes, when a disease is in all the magazines and on all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."" So I'm probably not alone in thinking the worst. I also know, though, that the health care system simply can't handle a panicked population spooked by the common cold or a bad pollen season descending on the city's emergency rooms. So we asked Dr. Jason K. Lee, a specialist in clinical immunology, allergy and internal medicine with a practice in Toronto, for guidance. For starters, we wanted to know if the pollens were flying early this year, given the warm weather and sheer number of allergy sufferers we've heard complaining. His answer? As of March 20, tree pollens started to become a factor. So how do you know the difference? ""The first question to ask is 'Do you have a fever?',"" says Lee. ""And allergies should not be causing a fever, so, if the answer is yes, then the next question is 'Are you experiencing shortness of breath?'"" ""Usually with allergies,"" Lee continues, ""people will have frequent trains of sneezing and it's usually clear nasal discharge. And, you know, some patients feel kind of tired but it's not a debilitating weakness or exhaustion. With an infectious disease, you feel exhausted and you may feel quite weak and fatigued to the point where it's actually hard to do the things you need to do for just daily living."" The COVID-19 situation is moving really quickly, symptoms vary from person to person and while not all the evidence is in, in addition to fatigue and fever, muscle aches and a dry cough are two other indicators of COVID. If you have these symptoms, you should call 811, Health Canada's ""Healthline,"" to determine whether you should head to one of the testing centres. If you're looking for a handy flow-chart, Lee suggests this one based on information from America's Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the National Institutes of Health in the United Kingdom. Despite the fact that the coronavirus and influenza are very different pathogens, the symptomology is pretty similar—the main difference being shortness of breath. This is why it'd be helpful if more people had signed up for the flu shot in the fall and winter, since it might have reduced the number of maddeningly similar-looking flu cases that have to be dealt with in addition to a situation that may shape up to be a health care crisis. So, how worried should you be if you have these symptoms? That depends on how high-risk you are and how severe the symptoms are. ""So, it seems like there's quite a spectrum of severity of COVID,"" says Lee. ""And it looks like mainly patients over the age of 50, 60 and 70 are most at risk. And it looks like risk factors like high blood pressure, renal disease, COPD and asthma are all risk factors."" Lee tells me that allergies and asthma are both risk factors for respiratory tract infections in general, so he advises anyone who has these problems to take special care and get serious about practising social distancing. For those with none of these risk factors, the one thing Dr. Lee isn't advising is for people to take two aspirin and call the doctor in the morning. Although he says nothing has been proven yet, in France, doctors are starting to warn COVID patients off aspirin and similar drugs. ""One common element in patients who have been having really bad outcomes from COVID-19 are those who take NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like Advil, ibuprofen, naproxen, Motrin and aspirin and things like that,"" he says. ""Those are very common ingredients of cold remedies, like over-the-counter cold remedies which almost always have an NSAID in them.""

So I think that's good advice to just have out there as well."" Christine Sismondo is a Toronto-based writer and contributor to the Star.

The province is switching to the evening, overnight and weekend price of 10.1 cents per kilowatt hour for the next 45 days at a cost of $162 million in foregone revenue. ""The savings will simply show up on your next bill,"" Ford told a news conference Tuesday, telling Ontarians it's now cheaper to ""do the laundry or run the dishwasher"" during the day. Energy Minister Greg Rickford estimated the measure that started Tuesday will save the average small business $150 a month with farms getting relief of about $300. Rickford praised Ontarians ""for doing the right thing by staying home."" The Association of Power Producers of Ontario applauded the price break. ""Ontarians should not be financially disadvantaged because they are following the direction of public health officials and staying home,"" the organization said in a statement. A group representing small- and medium-sized companies asked the Progressive Conservative government to consider extending the rate relief beyond the envisioned six-week time frame. That would ""avoid businesses that are starting back up after COVID-19 facing peak summer rates when the economy is just getting going again,"" said Ryan Mallough of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. Ford had hinted at the rate reduction move in the last week after closing schools, declaring a provincial state of emergency and urging people to stay home or work from home to slow the spread of the virus that has killed seven in Ontario and more than 17,000 around the world. In addition, thousands of workers in the restaurant, retail and other sectors have been laid off as the province moves to an essential services model. With so many offices, manufacturers and schools dark, TVs and computers are on all day in houses, apartments and condos when time-of-use rates are usually 40 per cent to 100 per cent higher depending on the time of day. The peak price from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., and the dinner rush rate from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. is 20.8 cents per kilowatt hour on weekdays. The mid-peak rate between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. is 14.4 cents. The $162 million price tag is on top of the $5.6 billion a year the Progressive Conservative government is spending on subsidies to keep the price of electricity down. In addition, Ford promised during his 2018 election campaign to slash rates another 12 per cent. The premier urged landlords to consider sharing the rate relief with tenants whose hydro is included in the rent. ""If you have a savings why wouldn't you pass it on?"" A ban on winter disconnections of electricity service for unpaid hydro bills was extended last week to the end of July as thousands struggle with household finances because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Liberals are asking the opposition parties and Senate to rapidly approve a $27-billion spending package, with a further $55 billion in tax breaks and available credit. The House will take up the measure on Tuesday and the Senate is scheduled to deal with the legislation on Wednesday. Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Trudeau said the legislative package would allow the government to quickly get money into the pockets of Canadians who need the help paying their bills, such as rent. ""We know that there are significant pressures on Canadians right across the country who are facing bills coming in, who are facing pressures on caring for their families,"" Trudeau said. ""That is why we are working extremely quickly to get money out the door and into the pockets of Canadians during this extraordinary time."" However, some of the benefits won't flow for a few weeks and a new report out Monday suggests many renters may not be able to wait until the first aid flows next month. Research from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives says just under half of renters in this country, or 1.6 million households, might have only enough money saved in the bank to pay their bills for a month or less. A further quarter, roughly 830,000 households, don't have enough income to get through a single week without pay, the analysis says. ""As the crisis worsens, the need to support low-income renters becomes even more urgent,"" Ricardo Tranjan, a political economist with the centre and the report's author, said in a statement. ""Both the federal and provincial governments must work to keep renters safe and solvent."" COVID-19 has produced a rapid downshift in the economy as businesses are forced to close and Canadians asked to stay home, which has led to a sharp drop in consumer spending and a sharp jump in claims for employment insurance benefits. Last week alone, the government received 500,000 new EI claims. Many people who file for employment insurance are able to find new jobs before very long, in normal times. But the Conference Board of Canada estimated in a report of its own Monday that the economy could shed more than 330,000 jobs between April and October, which would raise the unemployment rate to 7.7 per cent. If the projections hold true, the organization estimates Canada's economy would contract by 1.1 per cent this year. Many of the hardest-hit sectors employ many of the nation's renters. To help them, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which oversees the federal government's national housing strategy, has done a massive shift of its resources to deal with the crisis. It has also told any organization it funds to suspend evictions until the situation improves.

Finance Minister Rod Phillips on Wednesday injected $3.3 billion more into health plus $3.7 billion for other supports and promised an additional $10 billion in tax deferrals, doubling the deficit to $20.5 billion. Last year's budget shortfall was $9.2 billion. But as doctors, nurses, and other front line workers strive to contain the virus, Phillips said it was urgent that he table the record $174.3 billion spending plan. ""COVID-19 is an extraordinary threat to the health and economy of Ontario - the greatest we've faced in my lifetime,"" the 55-year-old treasurer told a legislature that was limited to 28 MPPs instead of the customary 124 members due to the need for social distancing. ""It demands an extraordinary response from all levels of government and civil society because we're all in this together,"" said Phillips, who cancelled the planned budget that was to have been delivered Wednesday due to a pandemic that has crippled the global economy. A full budget complete with future projections will be tabled by Nov. 15. Because of the worldwide uncertainty, Phillips was unable to include any such outlook. Premier Doug Ford, who had promised to balance the budget by 2023, stressed ""these are unprecedented times"" and the government will spare no expense. ""We will spend whatever it takes,"" Ford told reporters. To help families and businesses scrambling because of the outbreak, there will be $10 billion in tax deferrals. These include deferring $1.8 billion in property taxes paid by individuals and businesses. The employer health tax exemption (EHT) will temporarily be doubled to $1 million, which should help 57,000 small businesses - 30,000 of which wouldn't pay the tax at all. Phillips' statement warned the government is taking a punishing revenue hit in many areas - the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, which generated $2.3 billion to provincial coffers last year is projected to bring in just $809 million in 2020-21. That's because COVID-19 has forced the closure of Ontario's casinos. Overall, the Tories are expecting $5.8 billion less in revenue than anticipated. The financial statement sets aside $3.3 billion in new spending for health care, with two-thirds of it targeted at outbreak response measures. That includes a $1 billion contingency fund to direct as needed depending on how hard COVID-19 hits the province as the government considers whether to put overflow hospital patients in hotels. In addition, there is $160 million to boost lab-testing capacity and surveillance of the virus amid concerns Ontario has had to limit testing to the most serious cases and health-care workers. Experts have warned that leaves many milder cases undetected as the number of confirmed cases alone rises about 20 per cent daily. The cases going undetected makes it impossible for local public health officials to track their close contacts and isolate them to slow the spread of the virus. Home testing kits will be provided when they become available, said the financial statement that also sets aside $935 million to improve capacity in overcrowded hospitals with more acute- and critical-care beds. Nursing homes, which are full of frail elderly people highly vulnerable to the virus and the most likely to become seriously ill, will share $243 million to boost their emergency capacity and implement more virus containment measures. Another $80 million is going to nursing homes to maintain ""quality"" of care with staff expected to be overworked amid outbreaks that have already hit a number of long-term care facilities and resulted in several deaths. Given fears that health-care workers are running low on personal protective equipment, an extra $75 million has been earmarked - along with $120 million for improvements to home and community care and another $62 million to hire more doctors, nurses, and personal-support workers. Mindful of the importance of social distancing, the province will spend $23.8 million to boost the number of doctors seeing patients by video or helping them via email or phone. There will be one-time payments to families of $200 for every child under the age of 12. Parents of special-needs kids will receive $250 per child as part of that $336 million program. College and university students will also get a six-month break in repaying their Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) loans - a move that follows a similar interest-free period announced by the federal government last week. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now OSAP loans comprise both federal and provincial monies, and post-secondary groups have been worried about the impact of COVID-19 on students and how they can continue to make payments during mass shutdowns. Given the economic uncertainty and job losses in the province, post-secondary students have also been urging governments to enact a two-year moratorium on interest payments for anyone graduating this year. While Phillips praised the New Democrats, Liberals, Green, and Independent MPPs for agreeing to expedite passage of his bill, he ignored some of their recommendations for the statement. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath had called for immediate $2,000 payments to households facing pandemic-related economic hardship. ""I am urging the government to regroup, and put together a direct financial support package for people, and for small- and medium-sized businesses. Many Ontarians are at their financial breaking point,"" said Horwath, noting rent and mortgage payments are looming. Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, meanwhile, had urged the Tories to consider matching the federal 10 per cent wage subsidy to help workers and their employers. ""We know that if we do nothing, more workers will soon find themselves laid off,"" said Del Duca, adding ""most of what's been announced today is in the form of deferrals, which suggests that businesses will be required to pay what they owe in six months."" In the fact of such criticism, Phillips struck a non-partisan tone. ""As the premier has said there is no team blue, team orange, team red or team green - there is only Team Ontario,"" said the treasurer, whose fiscal update was a serious, sharply focused affair. It came in stark contrast to last year's controversial $163.4 billion budget that unveiled the defective double-blue Ontario licence plates, which are illegible in some lighting conditions, and a slew of hidden cuts, including to municipal public health funding. Ford was so unhappy with the 2019 budget that he demoted treasurer Vic Fedeli to economic development minister just 10 weeks later after being forced to abandon some of the key planks in the spending plan. The legislature, which is supposed to be in session now, will now break until April 14. Robert Benzie is the Star's Queen's Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

It's the inmates' responsibility to clean the range. The hand sanitizer they were given last Wednesday has run out. Everyone is served food on the same plastic trays that come from a central kitchen that serves the more than 500 inmates. And the rotation of correctional officers do not appear to be wearing masks or any additional protective equipment. ""We're just sitting ducks,"" says Justin, who asked his last name not be used over fear of reprisal. The Barton Street jail has a 560-person capacity, but cannot turn people away. It's common for the overcrowded provincial detention centre to have inmates sleeping three to a cell - two in the bunk beds and one on a mattress on the floor. Justin uses a clean sock to hold one of two pay phones on his range that are shared by everyone. ""Once it gets in these walls there is nowhere for it to go,"" he says. Justin has been in the Hamilton jail since last May for a non-violent offence. He is scheduled for a parole hearing sometime between April 10 and 14, with an anticipated release date of May 4. In other circumstances, another month in jail is nothing. But for Justin, the next month, he fears, will see the contagious virus enter the correctional centre. He has asthma and his mom and other family who are waiting for him on the outside have other health issues they fear could make them susceptible to complications. ""It's 40 days away, not a big amount of time,"" he says. ""But the fact is, in 40 days how bad is it going to be out there?"" Justin's mom Madeline and other family have been writing every level of government, calling lawyers, parole and anyone who will listen desperate to get the Hamilton man an early release. He has a job and school lined up. A message from the mayor's office shared with The Spectator said the mayor and council do not hold authority over the courts or prison and recommended reaching out to the detention centre or a lawyer. Madeline said she also contacted Hamilton MPP Monique Taylor, who has advocated for other families at the jail. The family was asked to sign a form to allow Taylor to make inquiries on their behalf. ""Why not let out non-violent offenders?"" Madeline says. ""They're being treated like wild animals."" Others, including Hamilton-based advocacy group Barton Prisoner Solidarity Project, have called to release everyone. The Barton jail is a remand facility where many of the inmates are those who have been denied or have not attempted to get bail wait before trial. Most criminal court cases, including trials, have been postponed amid COVID-19. At Hamilton's John Sopinka Courthouse, bail hearings and a plea court are operating. It appears most people are being granted bail. However, the increased number of people being granted bail also appears to have caused a backlog. Barton inmate Dylan Meyerink says he was granted bail when he appeared by video Monday, but as of Tuesday afternoon still had not been released. He says he was told there was a delay because there was ""too much paperwork."" He has been at the jail for a month and noted he could not see any changes to cleaning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawyer Courtney Keystone, who represents vulnerable clients, including many women at Barton, compared the jails to ""modern-day gas chambers."" ""Nobody should be going in the jail and everybody should be going out,"" she said. She said she's worried because there is so much metal in the jails, and the virus can live for long times on the surface. She has heard horror stories about inmates without protective gear cleaning up after sick inmates. There is a long wait to see a doctor and rumours are flying around about someone in quarantine on the third floor.

A correctional officer at the jail, which has a capacity for more than 1,600 inmates, was hospitalized and tested positive last week. Ministry of the Solicitor General spokesperson Brent Ross says the province has made a number of changes to corrections, including stopping personal visits at jails and allowing inmates serving intermittent sentences to remain in the community. The Ontario Parole Board is also holding hearings electronically or in writing. Ross said corrections staff have been advised to ""monitor their own health"" and report any changes to management. Jails are inspected and ""thoroughly cleaned"" daily or as needed. They have communicated ""proper handwashing and cough/sneezing etiquette"" to staff and inmates, he said. People being admitted are screened for respiratory illness. ""If an outbreak of any communicable disease occurs or is suspected, institution officials take immediate precautionary containment measures in accordance with operating procedures, including notifying the local Medical Officer of Health, and provincial health professionals,"" Ross said. Outside programing has also been suspended, including the Elizabeth Fry Society, which has provided services for women at the jail in custody and after release for more than 10 years. They were notified by the Hamilton jail that as of March 16 it was in the ""best interest of all to cancel programs until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Sharon Cole, the head of the board for the Elizabeth Fry Society Southern Ontario Region. The organization offered online programming material, which Cole said could be ""easily copied and handed out to the women."" ""However, the detention centre has refused us and we are therefore unable to offer our supports to the most vulnerable people in our community during this very difficult time,"" she said. noreilly@thespec.com 905-526-3199 | @NicoleatTheSpec -With files from Toronto Star SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Spec More from The Spec & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The provincial total of the COVID-19 cases is now 993, including 18 deaths and eight people whose cases have fully resolved. Two residents of a Bobcaygeon, Ont., nursing home died amid a COVID-19 outbreak there that has also left at least 14 staff members infected, the Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit said. Three residents at Pinecrest Nursing Home tested positive and since then, 35 other residents developed symptoms, though they have not been tested — per provincial guidelines — since the virus was already confirmed to be in the facility, said the region's medical officer of health, Dr. Lynn Noseworthy. ""This outbreak of COVID-19 is currently the largest outbreak in the province and really brings home how devastating and deadly this virus can be for older people in our communities,"" Noseworthy said in a statement. Various procedures to try to stop the spread were implemented once the outbreak was confirmed, ""but given the incubation period of the virus, many staff and residents were probably already infected,"" Noseworthy said. Ontarians got emergency alerts sent to their cellphones, radios and TVs at 2 p.m. Friday, warning recent travellers to stay at home. ""TRAVELLERS RETURNING TO ONTARIO You are at high risk of spreading COVID-19,"" the alert will read. ""You are required by law to self-isolate for 14 days. DO NOT visit stores, family or friends. Everyone should stay home to stop the spread."" Health Minister Christine Elliott said Ontario is using every tool to ensure people are well informed about the steps they should take. ""We need everyone to do their part by staying apart,"" she said in a statement. ""Lives depend on it."" The federal government recently passed an order requiring people arriving in Canada by land, air or sea, to self-isolate for 14 days, with penalties of up to $1 million or three years in prison.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. An 18-year-old McDonald's employee who said she had the coronavirus, causing the Rymal Road East location where she worked to shut down last week and her co-workers to self-isolate was a faker, Hamilton police say. Police say it was all to get out of work. On March 23 police were tipped from Hamilton Public Health Services about an individual who had created a fake physician's note with fraudulent medical information about testing positive for COVID-19. Investigators say the bogus note was given to a restaurant supervisor on March 19. The McDonald's restaurant, located at 20 Rymal Rd. E., at Upper James Street, took immediate safety actions by closing the store and sending all employees home to self-isolate. The restaurant remained closed for several days while professional cleaning services worked to sanitize the store. There has been a significant impact on the restaurant, local customers and employees. ""The magnitude of the concern for public safety warranted police attention,"" said Const. Lorraine Edwards, adding that the restaurant took the fake diagnosis very seriously. It's not clear how many employees were impacted. An 18-year-old woman from Hamilton is facing charges of mischief over $5,000, fraud under $5,000, use a forged document and make forged document. Police said the charges are for over $5,000 because of the cost to the business to sanitize. A total dollar loss was not clear. The woman has been released on an undertaking and expected to appear in court May 18.

""We're preparing for every scenario,"" says deputy minister. ""We're preparing for Italy. 2 p.m.: British Columbia has release its ""worst case scenario"" data related to the COVID-19 pandemic but the numbers show the province believes it will more closely mirror the South Korean experience, rather than the situation in Italy. A briefing offered today by health officials, including B.C. medical health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, shows the province would be overwhelmed if it saw a scale of COVID-19 cases similar to Italy. But officials say the model shows B.C. is already developing a ""cascading"" approach to free up additional hospital and other capacity over time. Data suggests travel restrictions and social-distancing measures are beginning to have an impact and the trajectory of new cases in B.C. changed from a 24-per-cent average daily increase to 12 per cent as of March 21 - but experts aren't ready to predict that the curve is flattening. 1:55 p.m.: New Brunswick is announcing 12 new cases of COVID-19 in the province, for a total of 45. Chief public health officer Jennifer Russel said today 11 of the cases are travel-related while one is being investigated as a possible case of community transmission. Russel says one new case cannot be traced to an infection that occurred outside the province. 1:50 p.m.: Finance Minister Bill Morneau won't say whether a promised 75 per cent wage subsidy for employers struggling to pay their employees will have a cap, saying more details will be rolled out soon. The federal government announced this morning that was increasing the wage subsidy from the 10 per cent announced last week so employers don't have to lay off their staff. Morneau also says the support and loans promised for small businesses on Friday amounts to about $95 billion, which is in addition to the $52-billion in direct support to Canadians that was approved by Parliament earlier this week and $55 billion in deferred income tax. 1:50 p.m.: Four passengers have died aboard the Zaandam as the cruise ship awaits permission to transit the Panama Canal, the Miami Herald reports.

He says the move will leave around $30 billion in cash in the hands of businesses. Morneau also says small businesses that access up to $40,000 in government-guaranteed, interest-free loans from banks to help endure the crisis could be allowed to keep up to $10,000 if they repay the rest of the loan by the end of 2022. The measures are part of a broader package of federal support for small businesses announced on Friday amid concerns about the impact the pandemic will have on the economy. 1:15 p.m.: Quebec is announcing 10 more COVID-19 deaths in the province, bringing its total to 18. Premier Francois Legault said today the province recorded another 392 positive COVID-19 test results, for a total of 2,021 cases. Legault says another 35 people have been hospitalized since Thursday, including seven more people who are in intensive care. The premier is also asking Quebecers to avoid travelling to Montreal and to the Eastern Townships area, which he says are the two regions of the province with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. There are 4,607 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada, according to the latest numbers from The Canadian Press. 1:15 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Service Canada employees can and should be working from home, despite the growing demand generated by financial aid applications. The federal government announced Thursday night it would close down the network of in-person Service Canada centres over COVID-19 concerns. 1:05 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador has reported 20 more positive cases of COVID-19 and reported its first hospitalization from the virus today. The province has now reported 102 cases of the illness. Nineteen of the new cases are in the Eastern Health authority and one is in Labrador-Grenfell Health. Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, says 68 cases in the province are directly linked to an exposure at a funeral home in St. John's between March 15 and 17. 1 p.m.: Ontarians will get emergency alerts sent to their cellphones, radios and TVs at 2 p.m. today, warning recent travellers to stay at home. The alert will tell travellers returning to Ontario that they are required by law to self-isolate for 14 days as they are at high risk of spreading COVID-19. It will tell them, ""DO NOT visit stores, family or friends."" The message will say that everyone should stay home to help stop the spread of the virus. 1 p.m.: Canada's deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo suggests Quebec has been hard hit by COVID-19 in part because its March break was earlier than the rest of the country. March break in Quebec was held from March 2-6, when the scope of the virus was still unknown and governments at all levels in Canada had yet to start enforcing stringent measures to prevent its spread. Other provinces had their March break from March 16-20, after travel restrictions and efforts to start semi-isolating were starting to be implemented. Njoo also says the current crisis is going to last months, not days or weeks. 1 p.m.: Prince Edward Island's chief medical officer of health says the province's schools and daycare centres will remain closed until May 11. Dr. Heather Morrison also says all non-essential government services and businesses must remain closed indefinitely. Morrison reported no new cases of COVID-19 on the Island. The province has nine confirmed cases. 12:45 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting 17 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 90 confirmed cases.

That was a jump of six fatalities in a 24-hour period that saw another 170 cases of the new coronavirus confirmed, a sharp rise of 25 per cent to 858. Across Canada, there were 3,579 cases and 35 deaths with dry cough, fever and chills being among the most-reported symptoms. Ontario's chief medical officer of health said he would not be surprised to see the number of new cases in this province start rising by 200 or more daily. That's because thousands and thousands of Ontarians who have returned from March break and other travel abroad may be ""incubating"" the virus circulating in global vacation spots and airports, Dr. David Williams said. ""We are in this upswing,"" he told a regular daily briefing at Queen's Park, urging people to stay at home if they can and stay at least two metres away from others when out and about. The unidentified worker from the Gibb St. Superstore is one of two COVID-19 deaths below the age of 70 to date, said Williams. The other was a Halton Region man in his 50s region who had underlying health conditions. Superstore management revealed Monday that the worker, who had no recent travel history, had tested positive but not been in the store for seven days. The store moved to reassure concerned shoppers on its Facebook page, noting the premises were given a thorough cleaning and assured by Durham Region public health officials ""the risk to our customers is very low."" At least 12 of Ontario's new cases have been admitted to hospital, including a woman in her 20s from Toronto who had close contact with a person who had tested positive, and a London-area man also in his 20s. There are now an estimated 50 Ontarians in hospital with the virus, up from 20 last week at this time. Twenty-nine of the patients now hospitalized are in intensive care, with 20 on ventilators. But plenty of capacity remains in Ontario hospitals, officials said. Still, Health Minister Christine Elliott defended moves by some hospitals to delay some cancer and other surgeries to reserve space for an expected wave of COVID-19 patients. ""I'm sure it's distressing,"" she said. ""But we absolutely need to create capacity."" In Ottawa, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said authorities are getting a better handle on the impacts of COVID-19 on the health-care system. About six per cent of cases are being hospitalized, 2.6 per cent becoming critically ill and one per cent fatal. ""The fact that Canada's fatality rate is at one per cent indicates that the health-care system is not currently overwhelmed,"" she said. ""But these fatalities could be further reduced by preventing the illness in our most vulnerable population,"" she added. ""Many of the deaths in Canada have been linked to outbreaks in long-term care facilities.""

Under pressure from opposition parties and dozens of business groups, Trudeau said Friday that Canada will increase wage subsidies for small businesses from 10 per cent to 75 per cent. On top of this, Trudeau also said a new ""Canada Emergency Business Account"" will allow banks to give up to $40,000 in government-backed loans to businesses, with no interest for a year and the chance that $10,000 will be forgiven. The government will also defer sales tax and import duties for businesses until June, leaving $30 billion in the economy, Trudeau said. And Canada's Crown lending agencies will get another $12.5 billion that businesses can borrow, on top of the $10 billion in credit already announced, Trudeau said. The government will also only collect taxes on the incoming Canada Emergency Response Benefit if and when recipients recover their incomes, Trudeau said. The benefits are set up to provide $2,000 per month to people who stop getting paid because of the pandemic. The prime minister did not say how much these new measures will cost, but he urged businesses to use this support to keep workers on their payrolls or consider hiring back people who have been laid off amidst the crisis. ""I know for many of you, the last few weeks have been heartbreaking…This climate of uncertainty could threaten everything you've worked for,"" Trudeau said during his daily address to the media outside Rideau Cottage. ""These are uncertain times, but my message for you today is: we're going to be here for you,"" he said. The extra relief is being hurled into an economy that — according to several different projections — is tumbling into a deep decline. Earlier Friday, the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer presented an ""illustrative scenario"" that showed Canada's real gross domestic product (GDP) could contract by more than five per cent this year — the largest decline since 1963. By this summer, the national unemployment rate could soar to 15 per cent, the office reported, and the federal deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year is expected to balloon from almost $27 billion to more than $112 billion. That would be the biggest budgetary hole, as a share of national GDP, since 1993, the office said. Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a national organization representing more than 2,500 businesses, also published a report on Friday that painted a bleak picture of what's to come. It concluded manufacturing output is on pace for its worst year since the 2008 financial collapse, with an expected drop of 5.7 per cent in 2020 due to an ""unprecedented drop in demand"" in the face of the global pandemic. Adding to the federal effort to protect the economy and ensure it can bounce back when the pandemic is over, Canada's central bank once again slashed its marquee interest rate on Friday. It now stands at 0.25 per cent. The rate was 1.75 per cent less than a month ago. At the same time, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the bank will embark on a multibillion spending spree to buy government-issued bonds — a rarely-used monetary practice known as quantitative easing. This is meant to increase the supply of money in the economy and make it cheaper to take out loans. Poloz said Friday morning that the central bank is looking to support the Liberal government's huge COVID-19 rescue package, which Finance Minister Bill Morneau said this week is expected to include up to $52 billion in direct aid to individuals and businesses — and that's before the extra measures Trudeau unveiled on Friday. ""The intent of our decision today is twofold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and — over the longer term — to lay the foundation for the economy's return to normalcy,"" Poloz said. Royce Mendes, executive director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said by email that — after Friday's actions — the Bank of Canada is now ""throwing the kitchen sink at the economy.""

In the ensuing economic slowdown, the federal government has been swamped with hundreds of thousands of applications for employment insurance — almost a million from March 16 to 22 alone. As demand for government aid surges, Ottawa ceded to pressure from workers unions this week and decided to close all of the more-than 600 Service Canada centres across the country. In a statement, the Public Service Alliance of Canada said the decision will protect workers from COVID-19 and ""will not impact the ability of vulnerable Canadians to receive the support they need at this critical time."" The union said most Employment Insurance and emergency support applications are done online, and that people will also be able to apply over the phone. Pierre Céré, spokesperson for the Quebec-based Conseil national des chômeurs et chômeuses, slammed the decision in a statement Friday. ""Service Canada is an essential service,"" Céré said in French. ""Hundreds of thousands of citizens have questions, need information concerning their files, many need help in person to fill out their employment insurance applications,"" he said. He said phone lines are often busy and government websites are confusing. He called on the federal government to increase telephone capacity and improve its online portals. Trudeau said Friday the government has been working to shift services online over the past few years, and closure of the offices was made in line with health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He added that special considerations will be made for people who can't access service by phone or online, but did not say what they are.

Ontario sent out emergency messages on cellphones, television and radio on Friday afternoon to warn travellers returning to the province they are at ""high risk"" of developing and spreading COVID-19 which has already killed 18 in the province. The emergency alert urged travellers to stay home for 14 days and monitor for symptoms and noted ""you are required by law"" to do so. ""Do not visit stores, family or friends,"" Premier Doug Ford told a news conference at Queen's Park minutes before the alerts went out at 2 p.m. While the ""vast majority"" of people are obeying the post-travel order issued by the federal government, Ford said some may be out of touch with the news and need a reminder. The virus has had devastating impact in Italy, Iran, Spain and the United States, among other countries, since emerging in China late last year. There have been more than 25,000 deaths worldwide and almost 1,400 in the U.S. A day after he accused an upscale grocer of price gouging for charging $30 for a package of sanitizing wipes, Ford said retailers can expect to see ""very large fines"" established in the next few days under Ontario's state of emergency. He also urged people not to flock to cottages outside Toronto after talking to rural and cottage-country mayors over their concerns city folk are straining supermarkets, and could overload hospitals that don't have the capacity at this time of year to deal with a summer-style influx. ""If you have a cottage, they're asking you please don't come up,"" Ford said. There has been an upswing in social media posts from year-round residents in cottage country, who are concerned about people coming up from heavily populated areas like Toronto, where COVID-19 is more prevalent, and spreading the virus.

The Ford government officially launched ""Learn at Home"" online Friday morning, which provides online materials for elementary and secondary students, who have been off this week for March break, and are, for now, set to return to class April 6 in a bid to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus. ""As a father myself, I know parents always want the best for their children, and I also know from speaking to parents that many are concerned that their child is going to fall behind while schools are closed during this difficult period,"" Premier Doug Ford said. ""To support families and students, our government has developed a one-stop spot for at-home learning. It doesn't replace school, but offers a great alternative as we approach the end of March break."" The province also released a modified TVO schedule, after it asked the public broadcaster to boost educational programming for younger students during the break. Ford said ""Learn at Home/Apprendre a la maison"" covers literacy and math and all lessons were created in Ontario by certified teachers, and is available in both English and French. The high school materials focus on science, technology, engineering and math, and students can also access course content. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said, ""the Learn at Home initiative will help mitigate 'learning loss' during this period of uncertainty. Our plan will provide interactive teacher-led math supports to keep students learning and empower all students to learn key skills with an emphasis on STEM education, while also arming parents with resources to support them as their kids learn at home."" TVO and its French counterpart TFO also have a number of online resources that parents can use. Jennifer Hinshelwood, TVO's acting chief operating officer, said in a statement that ""TVO's suite of digital learning products are designed to engage young minds in learning - a mission that seems doubly important at times like this when many of our traditional learning environments are not accessible."" The province also continues to work on additional online programming given the uncertainty around the COVID-19 situation. Other jurisdictions have already cancelled school indefinitely. The government says it is working with school boards to help students who don't have access to a computer or the internet, given public libraries have also been shut down. Mathify, which gives students homework help by certified Ontario teachers, is now available for those in grades 6 to 10.

The U.S. overtook China as the country with the highest number of infections. As the number of infections worldwide reached a half-million and deaths climbed past 23,000, the damage to people's livelihoods and their well-being from the effort to flatten the rising curve started to come into focus. In India, where the country's 1.3 billion people were under orders to stay home, legions of poor were suddenly thrown out of work, and many families were left struggling for something to eat. ""Our first concern is food, not the virus,"" said Suresh Kumar, 60, a bicycle rickshaw rider in New Delhi whose family of six relies on his daily earnings of 300 rupees, or $4 (U.S.). ""I don't know how I will manage."" India has the world's second-highest number of people living in extreme poverty. Rickshaw drivers, produce peddlers, maids, day labourers and other low-wage workers form the backbone of the economy, and many live day to day on their pay and have no savings to fall back on. The Indian government announced a 1.7 trillion rupee ($22 billion) economic stimulus package that will deliver monthly rations of grain and lentils to a staggering 800 million people. Around the globe, the death toll rose to about 8,200 in Italy, 4,100 in Spain and 1,700 in France, including a 16-year-old. The U.S. had about 1,200 deaths, about 400 of them in New York state, the worst hot spot in the nation. Most of those victims were in New York City, where hospitals are getting swamped. On Thursday, a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University showed the United States now had the most confirmed cases of any country, with more than 82,000. Italy and China, the latter of which was the origin of the outbreak late last year, both had more than 80,000. Louisiana was quickly becoming another smouldering hot spot. The number of new cases there jumped by more than 500 Thursday, for a total of over 2,300, with 86 deaths, including a 17-year-old, the health department said. The higher infection numbers reflected an increase in testing. New Orleans was gearing up for a possible overflow at hospitals, with plans to treat as many as 3,000 patients at the city's convention centre. From New York's Fifth Avenue and London's Piccadilly Circus to the boulevards of Paris and the streets of Rome and Madrid, restaurants, hotels, airlines, giant chains and small shops are all shuttered, and factories across both continents have ground to a halt, as cities, states and entire countries have ordered the closing of non-essential businesses and instructed people to stay home. Companies in Europe are laying off workers at the fastest pace since 2009, according to surveys of business managers. And the U.S. is bleeding jobs as well: The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week was nearly five times the old record, set in 1982. Dann Dykas, 37, of Portland, Ore., was laid off from his job helping design and set up displays for trade shows. ""Everything is so surreal,"" he said. ""I can't even get an interview for another job, and we now have to worry more about being careful and taking care of ourselves."" In Georgia, 33-year-old Ian Smith was let go from his job at a wine bar and is working ""side hustles"" and relying on the generosity of friends. ""On my worst days, it's hopelessness, and on some of my better days, it's 'What possibility can I create in all of this?'"" he said. ""I can't pretend that I always feel that, though."" In a rare positive sign, stocks rallied on Wall Street for the third straight day after an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package to help businesses, hospitals and ordinary Americans pull through the crisis won passage in the Senate. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 1,350 points, or over six per cent. The rescue plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House on Friday, would dispense checks of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, announced that federal officials are developing guidelines to rate counties by risk of virus spread, as he aims to ease the restrictions meant to slow the outbreak. Italy, the eurozone's third-biggest economy and a major exporter of machinery, textiles and other goods, became perhaps the first Western developed nation to idle most of its industry, extending a shutdown on smaller, non-essential businesses to heavy manufacturers. Among the companies in Italy that have shut down or rolled back production: Fiat Chrysler, Ferrari, Pirelli tires and Luxottica eyewear, maker of Ray-Bans and Oakleys. The industrial lobby Confindustria estimates a cost of 70 billion to 100 billion euros ($77 billion-$110 billion) of national wealth a month if 70 per cent of companies are closed, as anticipated. ""We are entering a war economy,"" said Confindustria President Vincenzo Boccia. Elsewhere around the world, South Africa, with the most industrialized economy in Africa, headed into a three-week lockdown starting Friday. The country is already in recession, with an unemployment rate of 29 per cent.

The government will give the self-employed grants equal to 80% of their average monthly profits, up to 2,500 pounds ($2,975) per month. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. So far, more than 120,000 people have recovered, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.

The extra overtime pay will continue until the beginning of May, and is in addition to a $2-an-hour wage bump currently in place. In an email sent Saturday to employees around the world, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said business was ""not as usual. ""This is a time of great stress and uncertainty. It's also a moment in time when the work we're doing is its most critical,"" the email said. Last week, the Star reported on Amazon warehouse workers' concerns over the spread of COVID-19 — including lack of access to paid sick leave, lack of access to masks, and fears that the new hiring to cope with demand made following social-distancing guidelines difficult. Photos shared with the Star showed packed lunchrooms and crowded work spaces. One Amazon worker at a GTA warehouse, who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity, said the company has since made ""pretty substantial"" changes to social-distancing measures. The new measures include staggering start times and lunch breaks at fulfilment centres, as well as deactivating every other workstation so that the distance between employees processing items is greater. ""Now they're letting people wear masks,"" the worker added. ""There's more and more people wearing masks. So they're allowing it."" Gagandeep Kaur, a postal worker and organizer with the Brampton-based Warehouse Workers' Centre called the pay increases a ""step in the right direction"" for employees, but said she'd like to see the measures made permanent. ""If they are an important part of society and people are depending on them, their wages should reflect that,"" she said. ""Two dollars is not a true reflection of that. They deserve much more."" Starting wages at Canadian fulfilment centres are around $17 an hour, not including the temporary $2 wage boost until the end of April. In his email to employees on the weekend, Bezos said he was ""not alone in being grateful for the work you are doing."" He added that Amazon had ""placed purchase orders for millions of face masks we want to give to our employees and contractors who cannot work from home."" ""Masks remain in short supply globally and are at this point being directed by governments to the highest-need facilities like hospitals and clinics,"" the email said. ""When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people."" Amazon is also hiring 100,000 more employees across the U.S. to cope with surging online demand. It is currently advertising warehouse-job openings across Canada. ""(These workers) are providing necessary items to the most vulnerable in society. Their role is very important at the moment,"" said Kaur. But the additional hiring still poses issues, she added — especially since seasonal hires do not receive paid sick days. ""They are adding more of the temporary workforce that will be there with the same precarious conditions,"" she said. In a statement posted online, Amazon said it has also ""adjusted our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes to prioritize stocking and delivering items that are a higher priority for our customers."" However, the GTA employee said they'd so far seen little change in the kinds of orders being processed. ""The things that have jumped out of me the last couple of days are children's books, puzzles, games, video games, the cosmetics (orders) I find are still pretty standard,"" the employee said. Despite more robust social-distancing measures, there are still some parts of the job that required close interaction with others, the worker added.

Already people worried about food staples have emptied some grocery store shelves, although governments have all said supplies are secure. ""We're in unknown territory. We have concerns about potential problems,"" said Todd Hames, president of the Alberta Wheat Commission. ""That's why we need to have governments recognize that farming is an essential service supplying food for the world."" Hames, who has a grain farm near Marwayne in east-central Alberta, said railways, the Port of Vancouver and companies that supply fuel and farm implements also need to remain open with spring seeding only weeks away. It's especially important since there have been delays in getting grain to market due to strikes and rail blockades, he said. ""Just when prices were starting to see our seasonal rallies in the spring, coronavirus hit. It's just all gone to hell in a handbasket,"" Hames said. ""Who knows what we're in for this year?"" Canada's cattle industry saw a sharp drop in prices when the coronavirus pandemic was declared, although they have stabilized in recent days. In 2018, Canada exported $3.7 billion in beef and live animals to 56 countries, but three-quarters was shipped to the United States. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association wants to make sure that market isn't affected and is relieved that borders are still open to beef as an essential good. But first and foremost, said executive vice-president Dennis Laycraft, there must be recognition of efforts to keep an adequate supply of food available to Canadians. Laycraft said the industry has been working with Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to ensure meat-packing plants remain open. ""We've had good assurance that we're going to be able to keep the plants up and operating at capacity,"" he said. The federal government is exempting temporary foreign workers, including migrant farm workers, from some COVID-19 travel restrictions. About 60,000 - mostly from Mexico, Jamaica and Guatemala - come to Canada annually, including 20,000 to Ontario alone. Bill George, chair of the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association, said workable safety rules need to be developed for those workers. ""We have to have some protocols that make sense. We view it as an essential service, but sometimes it would be very hard to maintain the six feet minimum separation that they want,"" George said. ""We have to find a way around this or potentially look at relying on other countries to supply our (produce), and you're not going to be getting a lot out of Spain this year or the United States."" George said each day of delay increases the risk of crops not being planted in time - something that Canadians could see reflected at the grocery store. ""That would be my concern. There'll be shortages and the prices will be higher if it is available. There'll be a more limited selection for sure."" Not everyone in the agriculture sector is concerned at this point. Jeff Lewandoski, who runs a cow-calf operation in Jenner, Alta., said any worries are six months away when young calves will be taken to market.

Lewandoski is more concerned about the long-term impact. ""It's not the virus itself,"" he said. ""People panicking worries me and the decisions our government makes worries me that some of this might have some long-lasting effects on our whole economy.""

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. Long-standing issues in the health care system are wreaking havoc during the COVID-19 crisis, including the lack of full-time jobs in long-term care. The province has directed employers to limit the number of homes staff work at to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect one of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to seniors in long-term care. But the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) says roughly half of the workers are part-time and most have other jobs to pay the bills. ""People are reliant on multiple part-time jobs to be able to survive, so we told the government, 'You can't tell people you can only work at one institution unless you're prepared to make up the economic losses,' "" said Michael Hurley, president of CUPE's Ontario Council of Hospital Unions. He points out that 85 per cent of these workers are women and more than one-third are single moms. ""You put them in a horrible position,"" he said. ""This is the consequence of ... intensified casualization."" One of the lessons of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 was that workers travelling between multiple health care jobs can spread the virus. ""This was a huge problem with SARS and we believe this is a huge problem today,"" said Vicki McKenna, president of the Ontario Nurses' Association. ""Many health care workers can't get a full-time job so they have cobbled together a bunch of jobs."" Workers who have been made to choose between jobs don't know if they are considered to have quit, taken a temporary leave, been laid off or terminated. ""We're going to need every health care worker in the system,"" McKenna said about getting these workers full-time hours. The unions don't dispute that it's better to have long term care staff — mostly personal support workers, registered practical nurses and registered nurses — work out of one home. ""Given that in long term care you are dealing with a population that is extremely vulnerable to this virus given their age and given their co-morbidities, this becomes a very important point of public health policy,"" said Hurley. In fact, they take issue with the government giving employers temporary broad new powers that include redeploying staff to other homes. ""We can't have employers moving people between sites,"" said McKenna. ""This is really wrong.""

But the adventures didn't stop there, and the family moved around the country. Hampson worked as a miner and as a plane mechanic, with evenings spent in jazz clubs, before finally settling in Vancouver and opening up a locksmith shop on Main Street. Hampson died this Sunday from complications due to coronavirus at the age of 93. He was the 11th confirmed fatality in British Columbia and the 21st death in Canada linked to the pandemic. At his retirement home, Haro Park Centre in downtown Vancouver, there are now 10 other residents and 12 staff members infected with COVID-19, according to health officials. His devoted son, Bruce, was not able to see his father before he died, because he and his wife are currently under quarantine at home. ""I knew he was scared and I wanted to comfort him . They were absolutely incredible at St. Paul's Hospital. Doctors turned on their phones and I was able to talk to him (on video) for 10 to 15 minutes to hold his hands virtually and walk with him in his last steps on planet Earth before going to the next world. ""He didn't speak, but he raised his head and smiled. I know he heard what I said."" Now, as the family grieves, his son is also angry. Angry at fellow Vancouverites for having parties and playing frisbee on the beach while his father was taking his last breaths. ""We're letting people go out in parks. We just don't get it,"" says Bruce. ""The city council is thinking of giving people fines."" Fines, he says, are for parking or speeding. ""I would like to see the reserve out there with rifles."" He urges people to think beyond just themselves and their families. ""You're endangering society, my family."" He's also incredulous about the shortage in testing kits across the country that has left him and his wife in the dark as to whether they also have COVID-19. Bruce last saw his dad in person two days before he developed a high fever and was rushed to the hospital on March 14, where doctors administered a test and confirmed his coronavirus diagnosis. A doctor advised Bruce and his wife to stay home and wait for a call from Public Health within 24 hours. After waiting for the call to come for two days, the couple dialed the non-emergency 811 hotline, but couldn't get through after many tries. Since they both developed symptoms, and Bruce is 66 years old with a pre-existing lung disease, they fully expected to get tested. But last week, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix announced a shortage in swabs needed for COVID-19 testing, and said tests were only available to people sick enough to require hospitalization, those in long-term care homes, health-care workers and people living on a First Nation reserve. Bruce said the testing limitations are unacceptable, and calls on the government to expand capacity in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. The WHO recommends testing all contacts of confirmed cases if they show symptoms of COVID-19. The volume and criteria for testing has been a matter of contention across the country since the beginning of the outbreak, with members of the public questioning why certain close contacts of positive COVID-19 patients, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose wife tested positive, weren't undergoing tests of their own. Experts agree about the importance of testing when it comes to the ability of public health officials to trace the spread of the disease, thereby containing it. ""The best case scenario for sure would be if we could test everybody who has symptoms. That would be ideal for information,"" said Dr. Eleanor Fish, a Toronto immunology expert who researched SARS and Ebola. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now But while B.C. was an early leader in Canada on testing, having tested 1,012 individuals by the end of February when Ontario had tested 629, the spread and concern over the virus in that province has made it hard for labs to keep up. ""We've done over 18,000 tests and the backlog of testing that had accumulated over the past week and a half has mostly resolved,"" provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Monday. ""We've also ramped up the capacity so that we're able to test as widely as we need to."" B.C. has also changed its testing criteria, so health-care workers, people associated with long-term care facilities, and community clusters of the virus unconnected to travel would be prioritized. ""For the majority of the people who have travelled back to Canada, self-isolation is what they need to do, even if they have mild symptoms, and they do not need to have a test in those cases,"" Henry said. Fish said that's because a positive COVID-19 test doesn't change a clinical response, except in severe cases. ""If you have mild symptoms then you're not going to be treated in hospital. It's prudent to stay at home and treat your aches and pains,"" Fish said. ""In terms of clinical management this is why we're saying it makes no difference to have a test."" ""Why is the Prime Minister not being tested? He's not showing symptoms,"" Fish said. ""The only advantage would be to get a negative."" Meanwhile, Bruce and his wife continue to experience symptoms, including dry cough, sneezing, runny nose and chest tightness. ""The fear is the worst thing . Once I knew my dad had coronavirus, it's terrible but you know and there's peace in it. When you don't know, that's the horrible thing,"" Bruce told the Star. Since testing is limited, Bruce wants health officials to stop ""misleading"" the public with numbers of confirmed cases that don't reflect presumptive COVID-19 cases. ""The numbers make it seem like the virus is under control . People don't know the virus is a killer. They could have it, and could pass it on to their father or grandfather."" Bruce knows his father was in his nineties and would've died sooner or later, but he wouldn't want anyone to have to experience receiving a loved one's coronavirus diagnosis.

It's the largest single-day spike in cases so far. The province says two more people died from the virus, bringing the death toll to 21. Two of the deaths have not been confirmed by a lab to be from COVID-19. The province is still reporting that eight people have fully recovered from the virus. Ontario continues to make progress on its backlog of tests and reported about 7,100 tests under investigation as of Sunday morning, compared to 8,700 on Saturday night. Meanwhile, a First Nation in southern Ontario said it was erecting checkpoints at entrances and exits to its territory after confirming their first cases of COVID-19. The Six Nations of The Grand River said Sunday that two people on the reserve had tested positive and were self-isolating. Elected chief Mark Hill said the move to set up checkpoints represented a drastic step in their fight against COVID-19. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he will remain in isolation at his home for almost two more weeks even though his wife recently announced she has recovered from COVID-19. Trudeau says the couple took steps to remain apart, but staying at home for another two weeks is prudent because he was sharing a roof with someone who was ill. ""I have to continue in isolation in order to be sure that we're following all the protocols and the recommendations by Health Canada,"" he said at his daily briefing to the nation in front of Rideau Cottage. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau issued a thank you to Canadians for their support Saturday in a Facebook video announcing she had been given the ""all-clear"" from both her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. ""I have a clear bill of health by medical professionals,"" she said. Gregoire Trudeau tested positive on March 13 after returning from a trip to England. Trudeau says his wife has now taken their three kids to the prime minister's cottage residence in Quebec, while he remains at their Ottawa home. Trudeau was the first major world leader to go into isolation because of COVID-19, and his role as both the head of a G7 nation and the only parent at home able to care for the couple's three children garnered him headlines around the world. He has shown no symptoms himself and neither have their kids, Xavier, 12, Ella-Grace, 11 and Hadrien, 6. Over the last two weeks Trudeau has overseen the launch of more than $100 billion in aid for Canadian families and businesses in an unprecedented nationwide economic slowdown prompted by public health demands that Canadians stay home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. On Sunday, Trudeau appeared to be turning the government's attention more specifically to the most vulnerable in Canada, designating $7.5 million for Kids Help Phone and $9 million for United Way Canada to assist seniors.

Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Sunday the most up-to-date national numbers show 5,866 positive cases of COVID-19, and 63 deaths. She said about three per cent of Canadians who have been tested for the illness actually have it, but warned not to get complacent because the test results lag behind the actual spread of the illness. Tam said she is cautiously optimistic about signs in British Columbia that the spread of the disease has slowed, but said the next seven days will be critical for getting a true understanding of what kind of impact social distancing is having on Canada's case load.

So why does it hurt so much when coronavirus robs us of them? HS By Heidi StevensChicago Tribune Sun., March 29, 2020timer4 min. read We could be forgiven for believing, prior to recent days, that we don't need each other all that much. That we had slipped, almost by accident, into a transactional society where face-to-face, shoulder-to-shoulder interactions with our fellow humans were unbearably slow and wildly inefficient and frankly, a little unpleasant. We can purchase groceries and birthday gifts and clothing and novels with our phones and we can have them delivered by a mystery human while we're not even home to say thank you. We venture, when we must, to stores, but we can check ourselves out, thank you very much, unless we're buying produce and the scanner gets confused and then we cringe when a human has to come help us. We forgo movie theatres in favour of Netflix and high school reunions in favour of Facebook and out loud, in-person, eye contact conversations in favour of texts. And it seems OK, mostly. It works, mostly. Loneliness rates are on a precipitous rise and we're choking on outrage most of the time and I do worry that robots and/or those Amazon Go stores where you just grab things and literally walk out the door will take over most of the jobs I was hoping my kids might one day apply for. But we've seemed, on balance, to be going with it. We've appeared, in large numbers, to have gotten on board with the slow phasing out of human interactions. And then coronavirus hit. And panic, understandably, set in. We are worried about whether we will live or die and whether our loved ones will live or die and whether that living and dying will take place under chaotic, not-seen-in-our-lifetime conditions because our health care system will be overloaded and our economy will collapse. But we are also worried about losing our human interactions. The ones we appeared, as recently as 10 days ago, to be phasing out. It feels tremendously painful for college students to think about abruptly leaving their friends and professors and roommates and classmates. It's a shock to our systems to no longer have, for the foreseeable future, a book signing or basketball game or theatre production or music festival or prayer service to experience with a crowd of people who will laugh and cheer and sing and worship and cry, maybe, alongside you. It's a lonely decision to socially distance - grandchildren from grandparents, instructors from students, neighbours from neighbours - even if it's a prudent one. It's refreshing, in a way, to realize how much of our health and sanity and joy are derived from our human connections. It's also a little terrifying. Because those connections are also what make us vulnerable - to a virus, but also to longing and pain. ""A couple of clients have been talking about the support so many of us are going to need if the virus, closings and cancellations follow course,"" family therapist John Duffy, my friend and podcast partner, told me Thursday when I asked him how the day had gone. ""We were talking about impending grief, for any lives that have been or will be lost. But also of all of the expected ritual, ceremony, vacations and such that will shift the expected course of life for so many people."" He talked about a high school varsity basketball team that was suited up and then turned away that evening from what would have been its last game of the season.

""It's one, relatively small, example. But it got me thinking about so many lasts that will, or may, be missed: dances, graduations, exams, internships."" I also spoke Thursday with Adriana Torres, manager of volunteer services for Fox Valley Hands of Hope, a nonprofit that offers support and counselling services. Many of her volunteers go into nursing homes and hospice care facilities for weekly visits with the residents. But heightened safety restrictions mean volunteers won't be allowed to visit patients at least through the end of March, Torres learned. ""Our patients are already so isolated,"" Torres told me. ""Their worlds get smaller and smaller because they're not able to go out anymore and they don't get as much family interaction or friend interaction as they used to."" Her volunteers bring flowers. Some play the guitar for patients. Some read to them from the Bible. ""We tell our volunteers to wake the patients up if they're sleeping,"" Torres said, ""otherwise some of them miss their only visitor for the whole week."" She said the volunteers are distraught at the idea of their patients having no one to visit them, no one to read to them, no one to hold their hands. Some of the volunteers will write letters, she said, but it won't be quite the same. ""A number of patients are no longer able to talk,"" Torres said. ""They have Alzheimer's or dementia. But they always feel the touch. They actually smile when they feel it. They need the actual contact."" What could be more true. What could be more elemental. What could be, honestly, more beautiful. Let's hold on to that. Now. Tomorrow. A month from now. A year from now. ""They need the actual contact."" Don't we all. And when it's safe and healthy and responsible to stop socially distancing, when it's OK to socially gather and socially engage and socially share moments big and small, let's cherish and cultivate that part of our humanity.

Here's how to stop overindulging during COVID-19 isolation By Douglas Quan Vancouver Bureau Thu., March 26, 2020timer3 min. read Spending way too many hours in front of the TV? Indulging in way too many salty snacks? You're not alone. A recent Bloomberg report cited data showing sales were up - way up - for all types of comfort foods, including popcorn (48 per cent), pretzels (47 per cent) and potato chips (30 per cent) compared to a year ago. This doesn't come as a surprise to Kira Lynne, a life coach and counsellor in Vancouver. During stressful or anxious times, such as what we're experiencing right now with the COVID-19 pandemic, people will reach out for things that bring them comfort, whether it be certain junk foods, TV shows or video games. ""It's a scary time."" Lynne said its important you don't beat yourself up if you find yourself giving in to these temptations. ""Be gentle with yourself on that."" That said, there are some practical things you can do if you're worried about overindulging. She suggests, for instance, delaying the snacking and the Netflix-watching to the end of the day as sort of a ""reward"" to yourself. Another piece of advice: eating ""mindfully."" Get rid of distractions, such as the TV. You'll enjoy the food more and won't need to eat as much to feel satisfied. Amy Bondar, a nutritional therapist and certified eating psychology coach in Calgary, agrees. To slow down the binge eating, she recommends that her clients ""see, taste, smell and hear each bite of food,"" they take in. In other words, ""experience the experience of eating."" ""Unwanted eating behaviours only happen in the stress response and the more heightened your stress and anxiety, the more likely you are to eat unconsciously and stand in front of the pantry or fridge gnawing on your worries,"" she wrote in a recent blog post. With so much uncertainty in the world right now and things that are beyond our control, experts recommend focusing on finding things that you can control. That includes building a daily routine for yourself so you have some predictability and structure to your day. Lynne says in the first part of her day, she takes her dog for a walk, comes home and meditates, makes breakfast, devotes a couple hours to work and then takes a lunch break. Adrienne Clarkson, Canada's former governor general, even weighed in this week on the importance of establishing a routine, tweeting: ""It is so good for the morale to dress every day as though going to the office, or a meeting. For heaven's sake wash your hair and don't wear pyjamas or a sweat suit all day! And, guys, SHAVE!"" On the question of whether it's OK to keep the PJs on throughout the day, Lynne prefers not to make a blanket rule. Instead, she might ask her clients, ""how do you feel different if you are in PJs?"" or ""are you glad you got out of PJs?"" and then letting their answers guide their clothing choices.

Go online and find a home workout routine that you like. Start an online business. Catch up with old friends over the phone or video chat. Do some spring cleaning around the house. ""Use this time as an opportunity to redefine your health, not decline your health,"" Bondar said. Lynne also suggests limiting your intake of coronavirus news each day. ""I check it once a day. Just as much as I need to stay healthy - nothing additional,"" she said, adding that she's ""asked people in my life not to send me gloom and doom."" ""I need to keep my mental health in a good place."" Experts say another way to lessen anxiety is to find ways to help others. Make an online donation to a charity, Lynne said. Or help deliver food to people who can't get out of the house. ""It gives a sense of purpose."" Douglas Quan is a Vancouver-based reporter for the Star.

By Jen Kirsch Contributing Columnist Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read With the pandemic and current global climate, we're in a new stage and phase of dating, and there's nothing wrong with you if that's where your mind is going or if love is what you're seeking. We are all trying to get by. Before COVID-19, many dating experts and writers – myself included – would advise that it would be in your best interest to meet an online match in real life as soon as possible, to avoid wasting your time and emotional energy investing in someone you may not have chemistry with. Now, however, you are left to communicate via text, in app, through video calls, but meeting up in person is no longer on the menu. So what does this mean if you are feeling lonely or looking for love? It's time to go back to some more old school methods of connection, like conversing with one or a few people at a time, but in a more enriched way. Now is an opportune time to bond over banter. We're in a more vulnerable state. Our anxieties are heightened, and our need for validation is far lower than it was as we cope with the sudden changes to our lifestyle. We are more aware. And mostly, we have been stripped of the distractions that are brought on through our vices and our learned ways of coping with confusing emotions (Running to the bar or out with friends or into someone elses bed at the first sign of feelings' of loneliness) and we are looking to others to open up to. To share with. To help us make sense of what's happening. We are actually willing to use these devices that were always created to connect, to actually *gasp* connect. Unfortunately, there's no rule book or guidelines when it comes to dating during a pandemic, other than keeping your distance and not leaving your home to see that person in real life. But there are some do's and don'ts when it comes to virtually connecting and maybe you can identify some behaviours that weren't really working in your favour in the first place. For starters, now's your chance to focus on quality over quantity. Dating apps dictate the more the merrier, and many users are often talking to various people at once, continually looking for the next best thing and moving on to another at the first sign of boredom or doubt. But in real life, if you aren't engaged or focused, there's no way to move to the next step. When you allow yourself to open up and engage with one person, you can actually dive deeper into less superficial conversations, therefore creating a stronger connection. If the banter is natural and organic and you're both giving as much as you're taking, then roll with it and see what comes. Which brings me to my next point: Don't force conversation. If it's forced via text, it won't flow naturally if and when you meet in real life. Conversations are best when they are natural. If someone says something that makes you feel uncomfortable, uncertain or leaves you with nothing to respond, chances are there's no connection there. Be real with yourself and with them and don't waste your time. Now that you're not distracted by life's usual fast pace, you can see a missed connection for what it is. If you're talking to someone you've clicked with online, the banter is flowing, you've been having an engaging conversation and you both seem to be sharing just as much, feel free to check in to ensure you're on the same page. You may be thinking that things are going well and once things get back to normal that you will meet in real life, but be clear of your wants and check in on them. You don't want to discover after spending your free time confiding in another that you see a future with, only to be blindsided when you find out they just wanted a pen pal to pass the time with. Be clear with your wants and needs before you get too invested. In terms of the best method or form of conversation to have, go with what seems natural. You don't need to force a FaceTime interaction or phone call from the get-go, but be mindful that someone's voice and mannerisms play a role and a part in your attraction. It can also create a more strong connection. Go at a reasonable pace here. Just because you know other friends are hopping on the FaceTime/Zoom/Skype bandwagon, doesn't mean you have to follow suit. Lastly, insecurities when it comes to feelings of rejection or inadequacies won't magically go away just because we have bigger, way more important things to deal with right now. We are all stressed, anxious and unsure about how this pandemic is going to play out. And though things are changing fast we are all human and all have our own baggage. Even the big dating apps like Bumble and Tinder, are reminding its users to swipe and stay safe as we all navigate COVID-19 together. When the Star reached out to Bumble, they pointed to some great features like voice call and video chat that allow for an even deeper connection without having to meet in public, or share your phone number or email.

Under the PBO's modelling, Canada's real GDP growth could contract by 5.1 per cent in 2020 - the ""weakest (year) on record since 1962,"" the office said. The PBO stressed that given the extreme uncertainty in the world right now, their report is just a scenario and not a prediction of what could happen. But it makes clear that Canadians will have to hunker down for the long haul during the global health and economic crisis. ""We assume that the current COVID-19 social distancing and self-isolation measures will remain in place through August, lasting roughly six months in total,"" the office said. ""Based on our economic scenario, the (federal) budget deficit would increase to $26.7 billion in 2019-20 and then to $112.7 billion in 2020-21."" The PBO's analysis also assumes that the world's oil producers fail to reach an agreement to limit production and stabilize world oil prices. Before the extent of COVID-19's impact on the economy was known, an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia already threatened Canadian governments' budgetary plans, particularly in Alberta. But the PBO noted that the federal government's fiscal position before the crisis was healthy, and the government has room to maneuver as businesses and citizens look for financial relief from the government. ""While additional fiscal measures will likely be required to support the economy in the coming months, the government's balance sheet prior to these shocks was healthy . Even after additional support measures are provided, fiscal stimulus measures may be required to ensure that the economy reaches lift-off speed especially if consumer and business behaviour does not quickly revert back to 'normal' conditions,"" the report noted. ""Given credit market access at historically low rates, and looking to historical experience, (the analysis) suggests that the government could undertake additional significant borrowing if required.""

Ontario has no such plan By Jennifer PagliaroCity Hall Bureau Toronto Star Sat., March 28, 2020timer5 min. read With rents coming due April 1, tenant advocates are pushing the federal and provincial governments to provide rent forgiveness or cash relief during the COVID-19 emergency. While the governments have made broad statements, there has been no specific policy outlining how the province plans to help renters in Ontario. On Thursday, when asked about the looming April 1 date, Premier Doug Ford repeated his previous direction that evictions be suspended during the outbreak. Then he added: ""If you can't pay rent and you're just in an absolute crisis, then you don't have to pay rent."" When asked later what that means — Would cash relief be provided? Would landlords be compensated? — a spokesperson for Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark clarified there is no legislation being passed or program in place. ""To tenants who are having challenges paying rent: please speak to your landlord about whether it can be postponed or if other payment arrangements can be agreed to,"" spokesperson Julie O'Driscoll said in a statement. ""And landlords: please be as flexible as you can. We are encouraging landlords and tenants to work together during this difficult time to establish fair arrangements to preserve tenancies."" Geordie Dent, the executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants' Associations, said that puts tenants in a ""terrible"" position and they hope some government relief will come soon. ""Most tenants pay their rent and most tenants don't like living in tremendous instability,"" he said. ""What you're looking at right now is a bunch of people who can't and they're being put in a very precarious position."" He said tenants are calling their hotline asking for help. ""What we're saying is, if it's between feeding your family and paying your landlord's mortgage, feed your family,"" Dent said. But it's not clear what will happen when the temporary ban on evictions lifts. ""We're terrified about what's going to happen in the next six months,"" he said. Bryan Doherty, who lives in Parkdale, says he's out of work and won't be able to pay rent April 1. Doherty, a member of Parkdale Organize and part of a campaign called Keep Your Rent that is urging tenants to not pay their April rent during the COVID-19 crisis, said Ford's words and the fact evictions are on hold for now are not any kind of assurance. ""The level of indifference and afterthought that this is being given is totally insane,"" he said. Asking that rent forgiveness and deferral be dealt with on a case-by-case basis won't work for everyone, he said. ""Let's say hypothetically my rent is like $1,100 and I have $850 in the bank because my hours have been cut this month. What's the math that Doug Ford wants me to do there? I know the math my landlord's going to want me to do, which is $850. And then I'll owe the rest next month. That's the situation that tenants are being put in."" This week, the B.C. government announced it would provide a rent supplement of up to $500 a month for those experiencing financial hardship who didn't qualify for other rental programs. The money will be paid directly to landlords. ""With lost jobs and lost wages due to COVID-19, many tenants are worried they can't make the rent. It's a challenging time for landlords too,"" B.C. Premier John Horgan is quoted as saying on the government's website. Ontario's new economic plan responding to the COVID-19 outbreak does not mention ""rent"" or ""tenants"" once. When asked about the B.C. program at a press conference on Thursday, Minister of Finance Rod Phillips mentioned funding that's being provided to other specific groups, like parents, and how the government's plan is ""best supporting the Ontario people."" Clark's spokesperson also noted a recently announced federal taxable benefit of $2,000 a month for up to four months for eligible workers who have lost wages.

A total of 30 per cent of households in Ontario were renting, the same data shows. Daryl Chong, president and CEO of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association representing landlords, said they're hopeful governments will provide relief, and that those who can pay rent should. He reiterated the province's message about tenants speaking to landlords if they need accommodations. ""We're not cold and heartless individuals or companies,"" Chong said. He said animosity between tenants and landlords exists ""more in the media than in reality"" and that the ""vast majority"" have great relationships. Where that relationship doesn't exist, Chong said he believes a landlord would still have a ""compassionate ear,"" given the situation. Coun. Josh Matlow (Ward 12 Toronto-St. Paul's), who has advocated for tenant rights at city hall, said the provincial freeze on evictions was an important step. ""Renters need to know that they have a home to stay in during this crisis and that while their most important concern is for their health, they're not stressed about how to even make their monthly rent."" Matlow said he's getting lots of concerned emails from constituents, including about what happens after the eviction ban lifts and there are months of unpaid rent cheques. ""The province needs to provide a clear and immediate plan that everyone can understand that ensures that tenants don't need to worry about their rent, when their focus should be on their health — and landlords understand how their losses will be offset,"" Matlow said. NDP MPP Chris Glover, who represents Spadina-Fort York, said renters should have been part of the Ford government's economic plan. ""Times like this is when the government needs to step up and support people. We all need to be working together to make sure everyone comes out of this hole at the end,"" he said. A paper called ""The Rent is Due Soon"" published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on Monday put a spotlight on the coming cash crisis for renters. Of the 3.4 million Canadians who rely on wages, salaries or self-employment to pay rent, nearly half have less than a month's savings and a third have two weeks or less, author Ricardo Tranjan, a political economist and senior research at the centre, found using Statistics Canada data.

Those who defy the order, which went into effect in the wee hours of Wednesday, could face fines or arrests, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a news conference in Ottawa. Freeland and other ministers at Wednesday's midday briefing initially said the order wouldn't take effect until midnight. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the same in the Senate during an appearance there. But several hours later, government officials began making the rounds to clarify that the quarantine order had been in effect for more than 12 hours already. ""It is in fact in place now. I do concede there was a bit of confusion,"" Hajdu's spokesperson Matt Pascuzzo said in an email. The new restrictions, which make compulsory what the government has been strenuously urging people to do voluntarily, do not apply to so-called ""essential"" travellers who are exempt from an ongoing mutual ban on travel between Canada and the U.S. ""We have decided that now is the time to make that measure mandatory,"" Freeland said. ""I think we all really appreciate that it is so important to have this self-isolation to protect the health and safety of Canadians."" While the federal Quarantine Act gives Hajdu sweeping powers to control the spread of a viral contagion, including steep fines, arrest and even jail time, it wasn't clear Wednesday precisely how the government intended to enforce the new restrictions. ""We will have mechanisms in place to enforce the quarantine,"" Freeland said, without elaborating beyond calling it a ""legal obligation"" for any non-essential traveller returning from outside the country. The measure comes amid growing apprehension about the widening scope of the pandemic south of the border, which the World Health Organization has warned is becoming the outbreak's new focal point, and where President Donald Trump has been musing about reopening parts of the country on the April 12 Easter long weekend, to the horror of public-health experts. The U.S. added more than 8,500 new reports to its total of more than 63,000 active cases Wednesday, a pace that now outstrips the spread in European hot spots like Italy and Spain. The hardest hit region is New York, which comprises nearly half the American total and which added more than 4,400 cases on Wednesday alone, mostly in New York City. Even so, ""there are large sections of our country probably that can go back to work sooner than other sections,"" Trump told the daily White House briefing. ""I'm not going to do anything rash, or hastily - I don't do that,"" he added. ""It could be we'll do sections of our country. There are big sections of our country that are very little affected by what's taken place."" If indeed parts of the country are able to go back to work, people would still be able to defend against the virus by practicing social distancing, handwashing and ""all the things you're supposed to do,"" Trump said. ""They're not going to walk around hugging and kissing each other in the office when they come back, even though they may feel like it."" Freeland pointed to the new mandatory quarantine when asked about Canada's contingency plans in the event the U.S. outbreak risks spilling over the border. But she made a point of noting that essential travellers - truckers, cross-border health workers, airline crews and others keeping trade and commercial arteries open - are considered essential for a reason. ""We need to be really thoughtful about what we do there,"" Freeland said, citing the specific example of long-haul truck drivers who are ferrying critical goods and supplies between the two countries. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now In the same breath, however, she acknowledged the ""fluid and evolving"" situation both around the world ""and on our continent"" - a suggestion that the government may need to constrict the border even more if the circumstances demand. ""As the situation evolves, we are constantly - and by constantly I mean every single hour - reviewing additional measures, including measures at the border."" Keeping store shelves fully stocked is as much about keeping people from panicking as it is about the provisions themselves, said Jenifer Bartman, a business adviser and consultant based in Winnipeg. Bare shelves ""can create a sense of panic, of insecurity,"" Bartman said - an especially dangerous circumstance among people who are supposed to be self-isolating at home to prevent spreading the virus. ""All of a sudden people are running out - and it's not even just getting this stuff, but it's running around trying to find it, too."" The number of air travellers from the United States is down 80 per cent from the same time a year ago, and land crossings are down 71 per cent, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair told senators Wednesday as he acknowledged the ""challenge"" of keeping trade moving through a partial travel ban. Truck traffic is also down slightly, but that's a symptom of production stops in the U.S. as workers stay home to combat the spread of the virus. ""It remains a challenge to maintain those supply lines but we are monitoring on a daily basis and I can tell you truck traffic is moving very freely and readily across our border,"" he said. ""I am confident at this point that we have been able to maintain those supply chains."" Drivers are being asked to rigorously self-monitor for any COVID-19 symptoms, to keep their distance from others, and use appropriate hygiene techniques, including frequent hand washing.

Over the weekend, Universal Pictures' ""The Invisible Man"" and Walt Disney Co.'s ""Onward"" were the two most popular movies to buy or rent on FandangoNow, an online service. Both were supposed to be exclusively in theatres for the next several weeks, but those plans were upended when most of the 40,000 U.S. theatres closed due to the outbreak. Studios are hoping to recoup some of the lost business by giving viewers quarantined in their homes an early opportunity to watch new films. That means practically every first-run movie, including ""Birds of Prey,"" from AT&T Inc.'s Warner Bros. and Sony Corp.'s ""Bad Boys for Life,"" will be accessible to everyone with a TV, internet connection and $20. ""As fans continue to look for new content to watch at home, FandangoNow has experienced its biggest weekend ever,"" said Cameron Douglas, who oversees the service. ""We expect to see another big week ahead."" But rentals are unlikely to make up for what filmmakers and distributors lose from the shuttered theatres. Some studios opted to delay major films scheduled to premiere in March, April or May, rather than make them available at home early. The box office is still the biggest source of revenue for new films, even though half of ticket sales go to theatres. Universal made three new movies available on demand Friday, including ""Invisible Man,"" ""The Hunt"" and ""Emma."" All were among the 10 most popular digital downloads on FandangoNow, the service said Monday, without giving exact figures. Fandango is owned by Comcast Corp., which also owns Universal. Some older favourites could see a sales boost from quarantined fans. Disney's ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" was the fifth most popular film on FandangoNOW over the weekend. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s ""Knives Out,"" which premiered in November, was also in the top 10.

Parents share tales of fun and frustration from the front lines of learning at home KT By Kristin Rushowy and Isabel TeotonioToronto Star Sun., March 29, 2020timer5 min. read The first week in, Laura Fraser Ash gave up. ""We've thrown home-schooling out the window,"" said the Burlington mom of three children ages five and under. ""Our days consist of negotiating meltdowns, me hiding in the kitchen with an enormous mug of tea, and trying to keep the baby away from my husband's Skype work phone calls."" They're not alone. While some parents are on social media proudly posting their children's daily schedules and photos showing kids hard at work, there are just as many who struggle to juggle things at home now that schools are shut down for the foreseeable future because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents can't get their teens off the Xbox at night - and then can't get them up in the morning. One mom said her daughter burst into tears when she simply asked her to study. Another mom tweeted that she has only just come to learn that her daughter doesn't really know how to tidy the kitchen so she is ""bringing home ec back to the curriculum."" Their tales from the home-schooling trenches are frustrating - but also funny. Fraser Ash, a primary school teacher, noted her daughters Maggie and Alice - who are 5 and 3 - are now ""working collaboratively."" ""They have hilariously learned how to both sit and pee on the toilet at the same time,"" she said. Sara Milroy woke up Monday morning with good intentions, then ended up reading the news online and went down a ""rabbit hole"" before realizing half the day was gone and her two boys were still in bed, as her husband worked in the basement. ""Our reality is, we're all staying up too late, and we are all sleeping in because we are not in a routine,"" said Milroy, an elementary music teacher in Peel. She's come to terms with her boys Brennan and Callum, in Grades 5 and 8 respectively, playing video games, because they do so virtually with friends and she can hear them laughing and having fun at a time when they miss those social connections. ""We will figure it out as more information is released and shared"" by boards about learning plans for kids next week, she said. ""I'm not going to sweat it right now."" Toronto mother Andrea Szego, whose son Emmett is 13 and daughter Eve is 9, said the time spent together means ""we're laughing more - but we're (also) fighting more because of proximity."" Speaking by phone - as her children screamed and wrestled in the background - she said, ""We try to keep a schedule, but it changes daily."" Still, she tries to squeeze in outdoor time, school work, fun stuff and ""Operation Wipe Down,"" which involves disinfecting common surfaces in the house. ""To be honest, I'm finding that all of a sudden, it's 11 a.m., or 4 p.m., and I don't feel like I've gotten much done,"" Szego said. Toronto mom Carla DeSantis is blunt: ""Our first week of home-schooling has been a bit of a bust."" Her two sons in university are busy with online classes - but her daughter, in Grade 9, isn't as motivated. One of her teachers reached out via Google classroom with links to resources, but otherwise, DeSantis has been coming up with ways to keep her daughter engaged, including compiling a stack of books for her to read. But with teens, she said, ""nothing is happening before 11 a.m."" On Friday, DeSantis says they were ""trying to get back on track ... I just told her to not tell me about her interesting dream but to write it down - (I'm) grasping at straws here."" In Guelph, Lisa Kahn's children, Avery and Grayson, spent two long days painstakingly colouring the driveway, brick by brick, with chalk. ""It's brought many smiles to our neighborhood,"" wrote Kahn on a Facebook page where parents have been sharing their kids' outdoor chalk art. NDP education critic Marit Stiles said when she first heard about the shutdown, she assumed they'd have a schedule for her younger daughter, who is in Grade 10. ""Then reality set in,"" she said. ""The hardest thing is getting her head around the fact that she's not going to school anytime soon - she can't see her friends in the same way she's used to"" and she also misses the certainty and routine of school. ""And there's the anxiety about what's coming next,"" said Stiles, adding it's important to focus on kids' mental well-being as well as their physical well-being during such stressful times.

Fraser Ash noted that for young kids, ""so much of their learning happens with how they interact with the world around them."" And even though that interaction has been significantly limited by where they can go, there's still plenty of opportunities around the home for learning. ""I'm not really in the mental head space right now to sit down with my kids and educate them in a formal way,"" said Fraser Ash. ""They might even be ready for that, but I'm personally still coming to terms with everything that's happening. And putting that extra stress on myself, and my kids in what's already a stressful situation, is a lot."" Still, Fraser Ash says the kids ""have probably accidentally learned more than I intended."" ""We planted some seeds for a new garden and they've watched them sprout,"" she said via telephone as her girls played noisily in the background with baby brother Owen. ""They've built forts, had them collapse, and built them again."" Milroy is worried about her older son moving to Grade 9 next year with gaps in his math knowledge, so she has ordered workbooks and hopes he can finish maybe a page a day. ""In our heads, we keep wanting to try to do as much as we can,"" she said. ""But we are sleeping in. We are staying up late. We are baking. We are eating. We are talking. And we have actually been able to slow down through this whole thing, which is nice."" ""But as a parent, and as a teacher, I know we will sort through this. The kids will be OK. Whatever disruptions we have this year, we can deal with that at the start of next year."" Eloise Tan, who has two boys ages 5 and 3, said at their place, the ""learning"" is mostly ""daddy has to do the laundry, do you want to help him?"" That said, her eldest, Theo, has also been practising his letters. ""It's messy - it's what our reality is like,"" said Tan, the director of research at advocacy group People for Education. While parents might struggle to get their kids to do school work, there are other things - like communication, collaboration, responsibility - that can be honed while they are at home, she added. ""Bringing kids into the daily life of what's happening doesn't need to be seen as separate from learning,"" Tan said. ""That is learning.""

Shelley Morse, president of the Canadian Teachers Federation, said her main concern is that some students won't have access to the technology they need to continue schooling at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""If you only have one device in your household and two parents need it for work and students need it for their school work it's going to create many challenges and create inequities for sure,"" she said from Wolfville, N.S. ""We have issues all across Canada with high-speed internet and the fact that in some areas you don't even have that."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he will make a COVID-19-related announcement in the coming days pertaining to youth. Morse said she hopes it will involve access to technology for students. Karl Butler, a Grade 12 student in Guelph, Ont., has been grappling with at-home schooling. ""For some classes they have plenty of communication with us so we can actually do stuff in those classes, but for other classes they're like, do work you had before. Good luck. And that's about all they've told us."" A video conference in a computer science class has allowed students to ask questions while lessons and worksheets have been posted online for a physics class, said Butler, who is aiming at a career in engineering. ""It's just hard not being able to ask any questions to the teacher from the lessons so you're not fully understanding it going into the worksheet. And as well they can't walk through a problem with you so you don't really know how they want it for a test."" Butler said students also worry how their marks from limited tests they took at school will factor into acceptance by universities. Butler, who has applied to three universities in Ontario and one in British Columbia, said he sympathizes with teachers as they await direction from their unions via Ontario's Education Ministry on how to teach remotely. ""Several of my teachers have emailed me saying they haven't been told what's happening. So they don't know what's happening as much as we don't."" The Ontario government has said classes will resume in two weeks following March break. In British Columbia, schools are closed indefinitely while the B.C. teachers' union and the Education Ministry come up with a plan. Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce said he has been in discussions with the presidents of teachers' unions in that province on how to support students at home. In a statement, he said they are also discussing strengthening professional development for teachers to better support students online and outside the classroom, as well as professional care on issues like mental health and special education needs. In an online video message, schools superintendent Jordan Tinney told teachers in Surrey, B.C., that they should remain out of their schools unless a principal has asked them to go to the building. A rotation will be arranged so staff can get any needed materials, said Tinney, whose school district is the largest in B.C. ""If teachers need technology and photocopying, we need to know when they will be in the building, who will use the copier, and then we will have a cleaning protocol for the copier after each use and for any classroom they have visited."" Jacqueline Loewen, who teaches kindergarten in Delta, B.C., said teachers in the district expect to get more information through an online conference next week but there's a lot of uncertainty about how students will be taught. ""It's been a very anxious kind of time wondering what is expected of us,"" she said, adding she may post a video of herself reading a book and ask parents to help her students respond to it. Loewen said she is concerned about the impact of an ongoing disruption to classroom learning for children.

Loewen is also worried about children whose mental health and learning needs are not being met by specialized school staff as well as students who depend on breakfast and lunch programs at school. ""There's huge concerns. It's heart breaking.""

The province is also set to clamp down on the size of gatherings, reducing them to five from the current 50 with exemptions for essential services like grocery stores, the premier signalled Saturday. Ford took aim at rogue retailers as well as people who were ""loading up"" on hand sanitizers, masks, disinfecting wipes, toilet paper, soap and household cleaners to sell online or in stores with major mark-ups. ""If you're out there trying to price gouge and take advantage of this situation . then stop, stop right now, because it's un-Canadian it's wrong,"" said Ford. He admitted being ""furious"" on Thursday when he first heard of upscale grocer Pusateri's charging $29.99 for a package of Lysol disinfecting wipes. The company insisted the price, many times higher than other retailers charge, was a ""mistake"" and offered refunds. ""Help us find these people. If you see somebody that is price gouging . let us know,"" Ford added, touting a hotline at 1-800-889-9768 that will begin taking calls Monday. There's an online reporting option at ontario.ca/form/report-price-gouging-related-covid-19 The $750 tickets will be for individual offenders, who could face fines up to $100,000 and a year in jail if summoned to court and convicted under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. Those penalties rise to $500,000 fines for company directors, and up to a year in jail, and a maximum of $10 million for corporations. Ford said bylaw officers and police will have to take into account wholesale costs and any higher input costs manufacturers face as suspected infractions are investigated on a ""case-by-case"" basis. While most retailers are being reasonable, Ford said there are a few ""bad apples"" not getting the message. Facing continued criticism from doctors and nurses on the front lines over a shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment leaving them vulnerable to COVID-19, the government invoked the Supply Chain Management Act in a bid to get medical materials to where they are needed. A number of hospitals, including Sunnybrook and Niagara Health, have issued directives limiting the number of masks given to staff for each shift despite repeated assurances from Health Minister Christine Elliott that supplies are adequate. ""Given the scarce supply of masks, everyone needs to do their part to conserve,"" says a new memo from Niagara Health limiting staff in COVID-19 units, emergency rooms and urgent care centres to two masks per shift. A respiratory therapist at Sunnybrook told CBC that two masks is inadequate, considering the high number of patients many medical staff encounter. ""You wonder how protected you really are,"" said Julie Nardi. Police and firefighters have also complained about a shortage of masks. Several police officers have already contracted COVID-19. Ford said he would raise the concerns about masks in a conference call with hospital executives. ""We'll make sure the front-line people are equipped."" To date, 91 health care workers in Ontario have contracted COVID-19, although there is no breakdown on how many got it on the job. The supply chain law empowers the province to centrally manage medical and other supplies and collect data on inventories at various health care institutions so that purchasing can be prioritized and incoming shipments sent where they are needed most, said Government and Consumer Minister Lisa Thompson.

""We're coming after, we're going to come after you hard - and I'm going to protect the people of this province,"" Ford said Thursday, taking aim at one of Toronto's most posh grocery stores. ""I have zero - zero - tolerance for price gouging. I'm calling them out - Pusateri's. I hear that they're selling hand wipes for $30 a tin. That's disgusting, absolutely disgusting,"" the premier said. ""A company like that would be selling hand wipes for that cost? People would have the nerve to actually jack up their prices to $30 a container for hand wipes? It's beyond belief,"" he said. ""Nothing gets me more furious than someone taking advantage of the public that are in desperate need of these items. That hits a nerve when people are being taken advantage of."" Ford said ""we're bringing this to cabinet and we're going to put an order that it is going to be illegal for price-gouging."" His comments came after a photo went viral on social media of the Lysol disinfecting wipes being sold at Pusateri's for $29.99. Retailers typically sell them for a fraction of that price. When contacted by the Star, an employee at the Avenue Rd. and Lawrence location, where the picture was apparently taken hours earlier, said Lysol wipes were sold out. Another employee at the Bayview Village location also said the wipes were sold out, but they didn't know how much they were being sold for because they had to scan the item for the price to register. Pusateri's president and CEO Frank Luchetta insisted in a statement that it was all a mistake. ""While no excuse, our stores are facing immense pressure on all levels of operation. As a result of this mounting pressure, critical elements were overlooked including the incorrect pricing of the product,"" said Luchetta. ""This was our mistake, our error, our oversight and we apologize to everyone impacted,"" he said. ""We are promptly reviewing and adjusting any and all products that may have been improperly listed."" Luchetta said refunds will be issued to anyone who asks. ""We are a family-owned and operated and we share in the concern of the new realities that COVID-19 has created for everyone,"" he said. ""This should never have happened and it will never happen again.""

Another half-million visitors to the online site had symptoms serious enough to be instructed to self isolate — another indication of how serious the situation in Ontario is. Around the world, governments have created online tools that ask people a series of questions to help them determine if they have symptoms of the rapidly spreading virus. Ontario official went online with its assessment tool, accessible through the provincial health ministry website, on March 23, after a soft launch three days earlier. (A word about the numbers in this story. The provincial site does not account for people who visit the site more than once. This story will refer to ""visits"" or ""visitors"" to the site. It is possible that some people have visited the site and used the tool more than once.) When the online tool was launched, people were encouraged by the health ministry to ""take this self-assessment if you think you have coronavirus (COVID-19) or have been in close contact with someone who has it."" Through Friday, March 27, 920,271 visitors to the site had taken the assessment, a series of questions that begin with the most serious symptoms. ""Are you experiencing ... severe difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, confusion, lost consciousness."" The online tool also asks if the visitor has fever, a ""new cough"" or shortness of breath. Other questions ask if the visitor to the site has muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose, or a headache. According to provincial data released to the Star, here is the result of the past week of online traffic to the self-assessment tool. The ministry was only able to provide a breakdown for 920,271 visits to the site as of 11:59 p.m. on Friday, March 27. Additional visits to the site put the total number of visitors over a million by Saturday afternoon. Of those 920,271 visitors: •100,645 visitors to the site were directed to ""seek immediate assistance"" by calling 911 or going to a hospital emergency ward. Those visitors would have indicated they had the most serious symptoms, including severe difficulty breathing and severe chest pain. •119,071 visitors to the site were directed to seek clinical assessment by contacting Telehealth Ontario or calling their doctor. Those people would either have been told to visit emergency, if their symptoms and history indicated that was necessary, or told to self-isolate. •197,115 visitors to the site reported moderate symptoms such as cough and fever. The online tool directed them to self-isolate and the tool provides timelines for that restriction. •246,641 visitors to the site were exhibiting mild symptoms such as headache, runny nose. They were also directed to self isolate. •256,799 people (roughly one-quarter) reported no symptoms at all. Ministry officials are struggling to understand the final category — 256,799 visitors reporting no symptoms — and there are several explanations. Some people who are healthy might use the tool because they are simply curious, but it is likely that the larger number are people who are returning travellers or those in the high-risk age category over 70 years who are seeking additional information. This weekend the province, to help understand the numbers in greater detail, launched an enhanced version of the online tool. The new version asks people if they have just returned to Canada; if so the tool instructs them to self-isolate for 14 days. The updated version also asks people if they are over 70 or immunocompromised, and therefore at higher risk. Local health units and Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, are working together to further fine-tune the tool, a provincial official told the Star. In its news release announcing the new tool, the province said it is critical to providing ""real-time data on the number and geography of users."" Meanwhile, Ontario is making plans to free up hospital beds and is in discussion with hotels in case there is a dramatic influx of patients over the next few weeks. Get the latest in your inbox Never miss the latest news from The Spectator, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters.Sign Up Now To put the online tool's numbers in perspective, as of Sunday morning, Ontario was reporting 1,355 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province, including two deaths. All of the province's confirmed cases are patients who have tested positive for the virus; however, as the Star has reported, many people who doctors believe have the virus have not been tested because Ontario is focusing its testing efforts on front-line workers in hospitals and nursing homes, and people (including nursing home and homeless shelter residents) who come in contact with large groups of people. There is also a testing backlog, which Ontario is gradually reducing. As of Sunday, there were 7,203 tests awaiting testing, a significant drop from 10,000 backlogged tests just a few days before.

Here's her advice for coping. By Laura ArmstrongStaff Reporter Toronto Star Sun., March 29, 2020timer5 min. read The world is a scary place amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, causing anxiety for many. Jam Gelua is among those people, but managing her anxiety is not new for the 29-year-old software developer. Gelua has struggled with anxiety for as long as she can remember. She considered seeing a professional in her teen years, but found the process of seeking help too intimidating. It wasn't until a little more than three years ago, when she found herself isolating physically from her friends and family, that she realized her mental health was getting worse and she reached out. Gelua was diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. Her psychiatrist suggested cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which focuses on changing negative thoughts and learning specific coping strategies, to manage her anxiety. Friends tend to offer Gelua a lot of emotional support, so while she tries to practice strict physical distancing because of COVID-19, she is also trying to be as social as possible with her close community. ""It's not as satisfying,"" she said. Gelua knows many people are experiencing new found anxiety during the coronavirus pandemic and now, more than ever, she said, people should be reaching out for support in any way they can. Here, she shares some advice for coping. When did the coronavirus pandemic enter your conscience as a possible anxiety trigger? When it started going on the news that people should be doing social distancing and staying at home, I work from home so in my free time I feel like I'm a pretty extroverted person despite being anxious. I like to go out and I like to hang out with my friends and have them over or whatever. It was making me really anxious to feel and think that I couldn't have that social aspect, where I don't feel so alone. I can only imagine people who are introverted that normally deal with this stuff but now they don't have an option, they have to stay home. What works for you in terms of easing anxiety? Lately I've been playing a lot of relaxing video games that you can do multi-player with or I can play with my friends online. I've done a lot of Skype calls with my friends so we can all just hangout in our own homes and feel social. I'm having phone calls with my therapist, we still do (cognitive behavioural therapy) sessions over the phone. That's really helped a lot. I find that I have to create a routine so that I can feel some sort of structure towards my day so I'm not just getting up and turning on my computer and working. I have to get up, get coffee, maybe do some yoga with my partner, something. How do your coping strategies differ now compared to before the coronavirus pandemic? The things that I've noticed that are very different, I used to try to go out for a walk to feel better, going to a coffee shop if I'm feeling anxious. I found that going outside and running an errand and being outside helped me with my anxiety because it allowed me to look around and not be in my own head. Being stuck at home, you are alone with your thoughts a lot more often than you normally would be. What does cognitive behavioural therapy mean to you? Cognitive behavioural therapy involves, for me, reshaping the way that my mind reacts to certain situations so anything that was a stressor for me before or currently, CBT really helps you break down your emotions and your thought process in whatever situation that you're facing. It helps you put into words or put it in front of you like, 'Oh, that's what I'm feeling.' It helps you cope. How would you apply CBT to the situation you find yourself in right now? Because everybody is at home and we're all just sort of dealing with our own stuff, there's a lot of emotions. Talking to a lot of my friends, we all sort of describe it in the same way where we're all just going through a rollercoaster of emotions every day. We feel anxious, worried, sad, grateful but we also feel guilty. CBT and thinking about my situation with the things that I've learned through CBT, it helps me not feel so confused or anxious about not being able to put it into words or communicating it with other people. Are there any practices that help you communicate? One of the things that I found that really helps me is grounding. You focus on one particular part of your body, you're really conscious of what your breathing is like, how your feet feel on the floor, maybe the things around that you're smelling or how your clothes feel on you, just being really present, basically, and being aware of that helps take you out of whatever downward spiral you might be experiencing. What would you suggest for people who don't know where to turn if they're struggling with anxiety during this pandemic? One thing that has really helped me was to gather your friends in an online setting, whether it be Skype or FaceTime. We did this thing called pod mapping where you figure out the people who are directly in your vicinity and you get to offer either financial help, help with dropping off supplies to somebody who can't go outside, that kind of thing. We all just sort of organized a safety net for one another in whatever way we needed to so if somebody says, 'Oh, I'm having a really, really hard day today,' then one of us can jump on a call with them and talk things out. I guess relying on each other is the most important thing right now for me. What would you say to someone who doesn't always struggle with anxiety but is experiencing it now and feeling out of their depth?

You're not the only one who is feeling unsure and scared and worried about the future and what's going on. Just take comfort in the fact that I hope this thing isn't going to be forever. It's really cliche to say but this too shall pass, right? This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Laura Armstrong is a sports reporter based in Toronto.

SchuetzeThe New York Times Tue., March 3, 2020timer3 min. read BERLIN — The tradition has persisted in what is now Germany for nearly two centuries, through wars, epidemics and revolutions. Before dawn on the bitterest of winter mornings, vintners harvest grapes that are frozen on the vine, pressing them before they thaw to produce a tiny quantity of exquisitely concentrated sweet white wine. But this winter, for the first time the German wine industry can recall, a cold enough morning simply never came. ""This year will go in down in history,"" said Ernst Büscher, a spokesman for the German Wine Institute, a trade group for German vintners that concluded last month that there would be no 2019 German vintage of the sweet specialty known as ice wine. While climate change is causing uncertain and chaotic weather worldwide, Germany has experienced a clear trend toward warmer winters, according to Peter Hoffmann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. The changes have wreaked havoc with everything from winter sports to riverboat journeys. According to the German meteorological office, this winter was the second mildest for the country since nationwide record-keeping began in 1881. Although it represents about 0.1% of Germany's wine harvest, ice wine is a beloved and closely watched premium product — and a test of winemaking skill. ""It's like the icing on the cake,"" said Ralf Bengel, who runs Schloss Vollrads, a winery about 15 miles from Wiesbaden in the west of the country. ""It's a wine that is used to represent our product."" In Germany, ice wine is first mentioned in 1830, when a farmer in the Rhine region left a vat of frozen grapes to ferment and noticed that it was the basis for a very sweet, fine wine. To yield the concentrated juice the style requires, water in the grapes must be frozen solid, which means they need to be harvested after several hours of temperatures at or below 19 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 Celsius), usually in the very early morning. In 1982 the wine was given its own German ""predicate"" designation, meaning its production follows tight guidelines. Canada is now the world's largest producer of ice wines, but the most famous (and expensive) come from Germany. The German version has been increasingly rare and endangered for several years now. This year, as it does every year, Schloss Vollrads left a few of its grapes — less than 1% — past the autumn harvest in the hopes of a particularly cold night. They were one of about 40 to 50 vineyards in the area to do so. But as in the previous seven years, Bengel was unable to harvest suitable grapes. Schloss Vollrads is one of several vineyards having such troubles. The dearth has led to a spike in prices, with a half-bottle of ice wine from the Schloss Vollrads going for at least 100 euros (roughly $110). The rarity encourages vintners to keep trying to produce the wine, despite increasingly difficult conditions, according to the Wine Institute, which keeps a tally of those who leave grapes on the vine for the winter harvest. ""I'm old enough to remember the '80s, when we made very good ice wine year after year,"" Bengel said. Hoffmann of the Potsdam Institute says that while climate change led to more extreme local weather events, winter temperatures in Germany were following a clear trend. ""It could be an anomaly, but the longer you observe, the clearer the trend for warmer winter temperatures stands out,"" Hoffmann said. ""You see the temperature trend is pretty stable over time: There's a rise of about 1 degree per 30 years locally."" ""Since 1988, we've been noticing that our main wine regions in southwestern Germany have become significantly warmer,"" Büscher said, speaking for the vintners.

To celebrate the birth of his child two years ago, Jung decided to try making ice wine after 10 years of sitting out the tradition. He was lucky: On a clear blood-moon night in January, the temperatures dropped enough for him and his crew to go out in the early morning to harvest. The resulting 2018 ice wine is everything Jung had hoped. Best of all, according to Jung, it will age extremely well. ""Ice wines,"" he said, ""are for eternity.""

Ontario is liberalizing liquor licensing laws to allow restaurants to temporarily sell beer, wine, and spirits to go. Tourism Culture and Heritage Minister Lisa MacLeod told 1,250 industry participants on an electronic town hall Thursday that ""our government is helping bars, restaurants, and pubs by allowing the sale and delivery of alcohol."" Premier Doug Ford said Progressive Conservatives are responding to pleas for assistance from restaurateurs devastated by COVID-19. ""These folks are hurting so badly. They're the ones who requested about home delivery,"" Ford told reporters at Queen's Park. ""It's a good idea if people don't have to leave their homes,"" he said, emphasizing there are no plans to shut LCBO stores. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario said the measures are ""to support Ontarians and businesses that have been significantly impacted by the spread of COVID-19."" Effective immediately, licensed restaurants and bars in Ontario may sell alcohol with food takeout and delivery orders between the hours of 9 a.m. and 11 p.m. ""All active liquor licensees may immediately begin offering this service if they choose and there is no application process or fee required,"" the AGCO said. ""Liquor may be sold for takeout or delivery through a third party, such as a food delivery service or ordering platform, provided they are acting on behalf of the licensee,"" the commission said. Anyone involved in the delivery of alcohol must have successfully completed Smart Serve training, which can be done online. ""Everyone at the AGCO is concerned for the individuals, families, businesses and communities affected by this virus,"" said Jean Major, the commission's registrar and CEO. As well, the 450 supermarkets that are already allowed to sell beer and wine — as well as breweries, wineries and distillers that remain open to the public — will be allowed to start selling those products at 7 a.m. ""in order to support early shopping programs for vulnerable people and to provide greater flexibility to retail stores."" ""The AGCO is also extending by three months the term of all active liquor, gaming and cannabis licences, authorizations and registrations during this extraordinary situation. In all cases, licensees do not need to do anything. Existing licences will simply remain in effect for the extended period, at no additional cost."" Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca first suggested the measures to help restaurateurs and other small business owners. ""I thank the government for being open to this suggestion,"" Del Duca said after hearing MacLeod's news. ""It will have a real economic impact for restaurants that are struggling to survive,"" he said. ""We are all in this together and I will continue to work together with the government to deliver positive progress during this difficult time."" LCBO stores remain open during the pandemic, but on reduced hours of 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will be closed Mondays for extensive cleaning to protect staff and customers. The Beer Store is also staying open, but only from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. The privately owned company has temporarily stopped accepting bottles returns. Charlie Angelakos, chair of the Beer Store, praised the government for ""demonstrating leadership and unprecedented action"" in response to the pandemic. ""We agree that the hospitality sector deserves urgent support,"" said Angelakos. ""The Beer Store and our 30 Ontario-based brewer owners are ready to work with the hospitality sector to implement these changes immediately. Let's stick together and stay safe.""

Restaurants and bars throughout Toronto have posted signs saying no alcohol or money has been left on the premises, suggesting there are mounting concerns about break-ins.

The team has isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (known clinically as SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the hospital said Thursday night on its website. The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and gain a better understanding of the biology and evolution of the virus, the hospital said. ""We need key tools to develop solutions to this pandemic. While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,"" said Dr. Samira Mubareka, a microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook. The team — Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto; Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University — was able to culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility. ""Researchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,"" said Kozak, a clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook. ""It demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate."" Banerjee, a post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University, said collaboration is the key. ""Now that we have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we can share this with other researchers and continue this teamwork,"" he said. ""The more viruses that are made available in this way, the more we can learn, collaborate and share.""

I was fortunate to be part of the 20-member panel looking at how we can move forward to best support children and youth with autism and their families. I believe the panel put forth recommendations that will benefit those waiting. I want to share a broader perspective however. While the Advisory Panel met to discuss changes to the program from June 2019 onwards, I was equally fortunate to come back to my clinic each week to meet children and hear their stories from parents and caregivers. I have continued to make diagnoses that may best explain a child or youth's developmental profile of strengths and difficulties. Sometimes, this diagnosis is autism, and many times it is not. In the span of a week, I see children and youth as young as 15 months to almost 18 years of age, and their challenges may vary. While one child may just have difficulty speaking, another may have a combination of challenges related to their mental health, behaviour, thinking and learning skills, suggesting several diagnoses such as learning disability, anxiety or depression and oppositional defiant disorder. During my training as a developmental pediatrician, I was taught to use my clinical skills to figure out the issue and then identify ways to address it. In my field of childhood disability, there are no cures and my service as a health professional is primarily in the form of helping parents understand how and why their child's development might follow a different path than what they may have imagined. More importantly, it is to make recommendations on how to then support that child along their trajectory of growth and development, and to support the child's ability to function in different environments such as home or school. In my journey now as a physician, however, I have come to a major fork in the road I call my clinical practice: Why do I continue to make diagnoses if the support systems are not there to definitively help children, youth and their families? When parents call and ask for a 'fix' to their child's development or behaviour challenge, I simply don't have any to offer, and all I can tell them is to contact such and such agency and wait. Parents become desperate and ask about medications to help their child and in that desperation, they may lose focus on the need for children (and parents) to develop skills. Yet those opportunities to learn and practice skills are far and few between in our fragmented system. Over the last several years, I have seen many families in six to eight-month intervals, and they are frustrated, upset and confused about the future. They are waiting, not just for provincially funded autism services as one example, but for the broader community and government of Ontario and Canada at large to pay attention to their reality. My goal is not to single out the provincial Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services as I strongly believe this is not their problem alone, but rather an Ontario and Canadian problem, regardless of who is in power. How we help those who may seem very few among us will shape our future. The protests of some at Queen's Park may help put pressure but much more needs to be done. So many voices are lost along the way. Voices that I listen to every day in clinic. Voices that we must respond to because within them are pleas for help. Dr. Mohammad Zubairi is a Developmental Pediatrician and Assistant Professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

Some hospitals are ditching the ritual of covering reproductive organs and fetuses during imaging exams after prominent medical and scientific groups have said it's a feel-good measure that can impair the quality of diagnostic tests and sometimes inadvertently increase a patient's radiation exposure. The about-face is intended to improve care, but it will require a major effort to reassure regulators, health-care workers and the public that it's better not to shield. Fear of radiation is entrenched in the collective psyche, and many people are surprised to learn that shielding can cause problems. The movement also has yet to gain much traction among dentists, whose offices perform more than half of all X-rays. ""There's this big psychological component, not only with patients but with staff,"" said Rebecca Marsh, a medical physicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, who spoke about shielding at a December forum here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. ""How do you approach something that is so deeply ingrained in the minds of the health-care community and the minds of patients?"" Covering testicles and ovaries during X-rays has been recommended since the 1950s, when studies in fruit flies prompted concern that radiation might damage human DNA and cause birth defects. Only in the past decade did radiology professionals start to reassess the practice, based on changes in imaging technology and a better understanding of radiation's effects. Lead shields are difficult to position accurately, so they often miss the target area they are supposed to protect. Even when in the right place, they can inadvertently obscure areas of the body a doctor needs to see -the location of a swallowed object, say -resulting in a need to repeat the imaging process, according to the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, which represents physicists who work in hospitals. Shields can also cause automatic exposure controls on an X-ray machine to increase radiation to all parts of the body being examined in an effort to ""see through"" the lead. Moreover, shielding doesn't protect against the greatest radiation effect: ""scatter,"" which occurs when radiation ricochets inside the body, including under the shield, and eventually deposits its energy in tissues. Still, Dr. Cynthia Rigsby, a radiologist at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital, called the move away from shielding a ""pretty substantial"" change. ""I don't think it's going to happen overnight,"" she added. In April, the physicists' association recommended that shielding of patients be ""discontinued as routine practice."" Its statement was endorsed by several groups, including the American College of Radiology and the Image Gently Alliance, which promotes safe pediatric imaging. Around the same time, the Food and Drug Administration proposed removing from the federal code a 1970s recommendation to use shielding. A final rule is expected in September. In the coming year, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, which gives guidance to regulatory bodies, is expected to release a statement supporting a halt to patient shielding. However, experts continue to recommend that health-care workers in the imaging area protect themselves with leaded barriers as a matter of occupational safety. Groups in Canada and Australia have endorsed the change, and a movement to abandon lead shields is underway in Great Britain, according to Marsh. Marsh, who's helping direct the educational effort, said perhaps a dozen U.S. hospitals have changed their official policies, but ""most hospitals are starting to have the conversation."" Chicago's Lurie hospital is launching an ""Abandon the Shield"" campaign to educate staff, patients and caregivers before it stops shielding across the organization this spring, Rigsby said. Shielding is used for most of the 70,000 X-ray procedures performed annually at Lurie in a variety of settings, from orthopedics to the emergency department. A few miles away, at the University of Chicago Medicine hospitals, the recommendation to stop shielding ""came as kind of a shock,"" said Dr. Kate Feinstein, chief of pediatric radiology. Feinstein said it seems contrary to what radiology professionals are taught, and she's uncertain how it applies to her department, which already takes steps to reduce the chance that a shield will interfere with an exam. ""We apply our shields correctly, and our technologists are incredibly well trained,"" she said. Nevertheless, Feinstein said, her department is weighing a halt to routine shielding.

As of last spring, at least 46 states, including Illinois, required shielding of reproductive organs if they are close to the area being examined, unless shielding would interfere with the diagnostic quality of the exam, according to the medical physicists' association. Some states are revising their regulations. In some cases, hospitals have applied for waivers or sidestepped state rules by taking the stance that a shield has the potential to affect diagnostic quality any time it is used, Marsh said. The amount of radiation needed for an X-ray is about one-twentieth of what it was in the 1950s, and scientists have found no measurable harm to ovaries and testicles of patients from radiation exposure that comes from diagnostic imaging after decades of looking at data. ""What we know now is that there is likely no (hereditary) risk at all,"" said Dr. Donald Frush, a radiologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, California, who chairs the Image Gently Alliance. There's also no evidence that fetuses are harmed by even a relatively high amount of radiation exposure, such as that from a CT scan of the abdomen, Marsh said. Nevertheless, some patients may insist on shielding. The physicists' group suggested that when hospitals craft their policies they consider that shielding may ""calm and comfort."" ""I don't think any of us are advocating to never use it,"" Frush said. Public confusion might develop if dentists continue to shield while hospitals don't. An estimated 275 million medical X-ray exams were performed in the U.S. in 2016, but 320 million dental X-rays were done. Mahadevappa Mahesh, the chief physicist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said there's been less outreach to dentists on the topic. ""It's high time we bring them into the discussion,"" he said. The American Dental Association states abdominal shielding ""may not be necessary"" but has continued to recommend using lead collars to shield the thyroid ""whenever possible."" But Mahesh, who's on the board of the physicists' association, cautioned that lead collars to protect the thyroid may not be helpful and could obscure images taken by newer 3D dental imaging machines. Contacted for a response, the dental association said its guidance on shielding is under review.

By Christine Sismondo Special to the Toronto Star Sun., Sept. 15, 2019timer5 min. read Everyone wants a winning smile. But are you willing to swish oil around your mouth for 20 minutes every morning to achieve that brilliant shade of white? Oil pulling is one of several folk remedy solutions regularly offered up to people who want to avoid expensive in-office procedures to get rid of stubborn stains and the natural yellowing that comes with middle age. Other natural methods include rubbing strawberries on your teeth, eating apples, broccoli or pineapple, brushing with baking soda or hydrogen peroxide and even using turmeric, which, given its power to stain my fingers yellow, seems counterintuitive, to say the least. ""It's true it makes things yellow,"" says Anaida Deti, a registered dental hygienist and CEO of DentalX Dental Clinic. ""But this is a very little bit added to the coconut oil people use for oil pulling, that became huge in the media last year, which is why people started to do it. Especially, I found a lot of young people starting to do it."" Although Deti doesn't do oil pulling personally (citing time as a factor), she does recommend patients with mild stains try natural teeth whitening strategies (including all the ones above) before deciding whether or not to spend the money on a professional cleaning and/or over-the-counter products. Since I basically fit that profile, I decided to try a couple of these folk remedies, starting with oil pulling - a folk remedy that involves swishing oil around the mouth to ""pull"" the bacteria from the gums. Generally speaking, people use extra virgin coconut oil, but I found an article in the Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine that suggests you can use olive oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, mango extracts and even milk. Since I had no good coconut oil in the house and exactly one last tablespoon of really good extra virgin olive oil left, I went with that, anticipating the worst. It turned out, though, to be way less bad than I expected - possibly because it was a truly delicious olive oil I'd brought back from Italy last fall. The results were even more surprising since, at the end of the 20-minute swish, my mouth actually felt great. My gums felt soothed, relaxed and less angry - and I didn't even realize my gums were angry. Hard to say if my teeth were whiter, but I could swear they looked brighter. After a second day of swishing (with slightly less good olive oil), I asked my partner if they were brighter. ""Definitely"" was the answer. ""How can this be?"" I wondered. Also what would my dentist say? ""I don't think there's any clinical evidence to support it,"" says Dr. Sharon Walden, owner of Dentists on Bloor (which offers professional whitening), ""But I've seen evidence in my practice that it does one of two things. It actually brightens the teeth and, more so, it actually helps reduce the inflammation in gingiva. So my patients, myself even included, have used it to combat gingivitis. It wasn't intended for teeth whitening, but that was a beneficial side effect."" Walden noted that she's only ever used extra virgin coconut oil, not olive oil, and also that pregnant patients are often keen to try oil as an alternative to commercial mouthwash, since some brands contain alcohol. When it came to the other folk remedies, however, she was a little less enthusiastic, although couldn't comment on all of them. Since Walden advises her patients to avoid berries when they're going through whitening treatments, she couldn't see how they could help. Walden was concerned that apples and baking soda might be hard on the enamel, so she advised me to use baking soda only occasionally. She also remarked that the use of hydrogen peroxide has fallen out of favour as a home remedy. So has ""fresh urine,"" which was once recommended as the best mouthwash by Pierre Fauchard, physician and ""father of modern dentistry,"" who, in the mid-1700s, dismissed a lot of contemporary cures as quackery. In The History of Oral Hygiene Products, How Far Have We Come in 6,000 Years, Stuart L. Fischman shows us that our obsession with pearly whites is far from new. In addition to human pee, for instance, people have turned to chalk, cream of tartar, charcoal, chewing sticks, opiates, alum, brick dust, pumice and even metal files to remove the yellow and brighten their smiles. I decided to give these ancient remedies a miss and, instead, ask hygienist Anaida Deti about prevention. ""I usually say that smoking is the one thing that people should be staying away from,"" she says. ""And I usually find that things that have a lot of colouring in them, like ketchup, mustard, pop, soda, coffee and tea, leave stains so, if you can rinse with water right after you drink coffee or eat things, that will help a lot."" That's easy enough. And it's better to head stains off at the pass, since there's probably only so much that can be done at home to remedy deeply stained teeth. Both dental professionals I spoke to were in full agreement on that. In addition to damaged teeth that turn dark after, say, a root canal and can only be fixed with crowns, there are people with heavy ""superficial"" damage from smoking, coffee, red wine and, well, middle age, whose best bet is probably in-office whitening treatments. ""It depends on the stains,"" says Walden. ""Some of the over-the-counter products, like Crest Platinum white strips (her favourite recommendation), could work on very mild stains but, if you've got deeper stains, it really needs something more professional. When it comes to deeper, darker staining, such as tetracycline staining, even I struggle getting these patients brighter with a professional agent."" I don't want to get there. And if rinsing and swishing can save me from that fate, I'm in. Looks like it's time to invest in some coconut oil. After all, two out of two dental professionals agree.

And probably more the latter, because I'm convinced the afterlife is dental-work free, where all teeth are pearly white and perfectly straight with the plaque-fighting properties of pure titanium. Hell is a place of daily root canals. Because I hate the dentist, I rarely see one. My general rule is to go only when something hurts. And not just your average toothache, something that can be managed with ibuprofen. When I bite down on a banana and the tears of agony roll down my face, I think about calling the dentist. Like all good phobias, this one is rooted in childhood. I had problems with my teeth at an early age and let's just say that the dentistry of the 1970s was not as advanced in the field of pain management as it is today. My childhood dentist was a beast of a man. In my memory, he is roughly seven feet tall with a giant drill and one of those huge scraper hooks where his hands should have been. That bad man hurt me and he hurt me good. It kind of snowballed from there to the point where I now hate just about everything about the experience. I'm particularly petrified of the high-pitched whining sound the drill makes, a sound that I always think should be followed by someone screaming. All the technological advances in the world and a dentist drill still has to sound like something is boring a hole straight through my skull and into the soft mushy part of my brain. I also dislike the sunny disposition of dental hygienists who are so nice as to explain how to floss — a lecture I continue to get as I trundle through middle age. They seem to enjoy flashing their perfect teeth at me from time to time as some sort of twisted reminder of what I don't have, but could if I only followed their vigorous brushing, flossing and repeating regimen. They also seem to find my state of fear somewhat odd and slightly amusing. I'm usually in maximum perspiration mode upon arrival and when I sit in that infernal chair I'm stiff as a board, my hands threatening to rip the arms clean off. I open my mouth only as wide as I absolutely have to, forcing all those who try and enter into a sort of nasty tug of war with my lips. It's gotten so bad they've taken to sedating me. I take a little pill about an hour before I go and basically arrive at the office legally stoned. It's the only think I like about the whole experience. But it's time to get over my childhood fears and get a handle on this once and for all. So I've promised myself that if I behave and went to the dentist like a good boy, I'd give myself a reward. Probably some candy. Drew Edwards thinks ""plaque"" is a funny word. He can be reached at drew@drewedwards.ca.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue.

The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading...

""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border.

Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning.""

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

Metro and the union that represents Loblaw workers say the wage boost is retroactive to March 8. Metro says the raise will last until May 2, but the Loblaw union did not give an end date. They say the raise is an acknowledgment of the tough but necessary work their employees are doing during an unprecedented time. Grocery stores are an essential service, so they can't be shuttered during the pandemic, even for the sake of social distancing. Both chains are also due to install Plexiglas barriers at service counters in an effort to protect employees from becoming infected.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to thespec.com for unlimited access to all articles. TORONTO - Ontario's top medical official is recommending that all bars and restaurants close, with the exception of those that do take-out and delivery. Dr. David Williams is also recommending that all private schools and daycares also close, along with churches and other places of worship. He says people should not gather in groups larger than 50, in line with a federal recommendation. Ontario has already ordered all public schools stay closed for two weeks after March break. The province announced earlier Monday that it is delaying the release of its full budget as it prepares to weather economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver a one-year economic outlook on March 25, which will detail the fiscal resources that will be available for sectors such as health care and municipalities. ""It's important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation,"" he said. Phillips said the full budget would be released as late as the fall. The province last week announced a $100-million COVID-19 contingency fund. Ontario reported 32 new COVID-19 cases Monday, bringing the total in the province to 177. The new cases are across the province, including in Hamilton, Ottawa and Sudbury, but the majority are in the Greater Toronto Area. New patients are all self-isolating, but other information - including their ages and how they became infected - is sparse. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, chalked that up to new lab testing sites that have opened up to accommodate increased demand being unable so far to quickly enter that supplementary information.

Wednesday, March 18, 2020. World Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight MR By Mia RabsonThe Canadian Press Wed., March 18, 2020timer6 min. read updateArticle was updated Mar. 30, 2020 OTTAWA - The federal government will deploy up to $82 billion in direct spending and deferred taxes to help every Canadian get through the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. ""In these extraordinary times our government is taking extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau said in a news conference outside his Ottawa residence. He said the package is aimed at ensuring people can do what they need to do to protect their health and that of others without fear of not being able to feed their families or pay their rent or mortgages. ""Public health should never hinge on financial considerations,"" Trudeau said. The unprecedented financial-aid package will beef up Canada Child Benefit payments for families and GST tax credits for low- and middle-income earners, provide a wage subsidy for small businesses to help them keep staff on the payroll during the slowdown, pause Canada Student Loan payments for six months and establish emergency benefits for people who don't qualify for employment insurance. There will be support for shelters that house the homeless or people fleeing gender-based violence, to ensure they can help people and manage the need for some to self-isolate. A separate fund to help First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities respond to COVID-19 is also part of the package. The single biggest item is deferring tax payments until August, accounting for an estimated $55 billion. Canadian businesses and individuals who owe tax money after today will be able to put off paying it until after August. The government is also moving the deadline for filing taxes to June 1 but is encouraging those who receive benefits from the GST credit or the child benefit to file as soon as possible to get access the additional funds available under those programs. Health authorities say the novel coronavirus could overwhelm Canada's hospitals if it spreads freely. Most people suffer relatively manageable symptoms, such as fevers and coughs, but a small percentage of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care, sometimes for weeks. More than 200,000 people around the world have tested positive for the virus and 8,300 are known to have died from it. There are now 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including nine deaths. In addition, Canada and the United States agreed Wednesday to close their shared border while allowing trade to continue. The agreement, involving two countries that have already barred certain foreign visitors, followed several days of talks between Washington and Ottawa to find a mutually agreeable way to limit the spread of the virus without shutting down vital trade and commerce corridors, which in some cases are lifelines on both sides of the border. ""Travellers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""In both our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home, we're telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours unless they absolutely have to,"" he said. ""This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the concerning thing is the sharp uptick in cases, as well as wider reports of ""community transmission."" Government efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, which originated in central China, are aimed at ensuring the number of cases does not spike so quickly that it overwhelms Canada's health system. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is encouraging every Canadian who can stay at home to do so, but acknowledged the wide-scale shut down of everything from schools to retailers to international travel, ""is having a significant impact on our economy."" ""This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before,"" he said. ""Clearly the impacts of this pandemic have been profound and will continue to be profound. Households and businesses are already feeling the effects. Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable. Whatever it takes."" The government last week announced a $1-billion fund to help Canada respond to the virus, including funds for the health-care system. Morneau said this is still all Phase 1 of the response, with more to come, including looking at what will be needed to help businesses and families return to normal, whenever that can happen. It is not clear to anyone how long the shutdowns will last but many weeks to months appears to be the minimum projection. Avery Shenfeld, the chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the federal package will ""cushion the blow"" but not prevent an expected recession. Shenfeld said the Canadian aid is better than the current United States' plan to mail a cheque to every American, because the disruptions are not evenly spread. ""But at this point it makes much more sense for the federal government, which can borrow on our collective behalfs at rock-bottom interest rates, to go deeper into debt, than to rely on business and households to have access to even more credit than they will already need to stay afloat,"" Shenfeld said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who enacted a provincewide state of emergency Tuesday, applauded the federal help as ""important steps to help keep our economy and people strong."" Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement the federal package will be of help, but said the wage subsidy on offer needs to be much higher. Morneau is promising $3.8 billion to help small businesses, charities and non-profit organizations keep paying employees, by subsidizing 10 per cent of an employee's wages for three months. It will max out at $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business. But the CFIB said by last weekend half of Canada's small businesses had reported drops in sales, and a quarter said they won't survive a significant drop in income that lasts more than one month. CFIB wants the government to increase the wage subsidy from 10 per cent to between 75 and 90 per cent, which is what some European countries have done. Denmark, for instance, offered a 75 per cent wage subsidy for up to three months. Conservative employment critic and British Columbia MP Dan Albas said he is hopeful the aid package will work but noted the concerns it's not enough to help small business. He was also critical of the Trudeau government for being too slow to react on things such as closing the border. Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump announced separately Wednesday that the U.S.-Canada border will be temporarily closed to non-essential travel, but Trudeau said the critical supply chain between the two countries will continue. While many civil servants who will be needed to roll out the aid package are working from home, Trudeau said the government has spent the last few days ensuring the capacity to get the money out because too many Canadians and businesses are ""looking at their sources of income dry up because of COVID-19."" ""It could make a difference on the health of all Canadians,"" he said. ""People need to be able to self-isolate, need to be able to stay home, need to be able to care for their families."" Parliament, which was suspended last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be recalled for a short emergency session to give the government legislative authority to implement the planned aid package. The government has stressed that Canada has a strong financial position that will allow it to absorb the costs. Economic growth in Canada and around the world, already sluggish before the outbreak, has slowed to a crawl, with many economists predicting a global recession.

Banks have offered a six month payment deferral for mortgages and organizations responsible for workers' compensation and occupational health and safety in some provinces have produced timely guidance material. Much more needs to be done. Little if any action has been taken to relieve the needs of tenants who can't meet their rental payments. No one in Canada, including the precariously employed, should be left homeless or destitute because of COVID-19 and the consequences it will have for both the health of our people and our economy. We must ensure that workers have the ability to stop working if they are ill, in their own interest and in the interest of public health. Statistics Canada estimates that between 27 per cent and 45 per cent of all Canadian workers do not have full-time stable jobs. This does not include low wage earners with full-time stable jobs who still live from paycheque to paycheque. The precariously employed include: the solo self-employed including those working in the gig economy; those on temporary contracts, working on call or for temporary employment agencies; and part-time workers, including the involuntary part time. In many provinces, full-time, low-wage earners are also in situations of employment precarity where employers may lay them off at will or where non-unionized workers can be fired for being absent for more than three days, even if they are absent because of illness. Labour legislation does not discourage employers from requiring sick notes to justify absences. Bill 148 in Ontario had curtailed employers' right to require sick notes, but that provision was repealed by the Ford government's Making Ontario Open for Business Bill 47. Now, we've heard promises that legislation is in the works that will ensure employers no longer require sickness notes in Ontario for those in quarantine, although the legislation has yet to be tabled. Anyone can be at risk of contracting COVID-19 at work, but workers in certain sectors, such as health care and also those working with the public, are particularly at risk. Occupational Health and Safety legislation requires that employers protect workers from hazards and workers have the right to refuse work that endangers their health. Health and safety regulators and public health officials are mandated to proactively provide guidance to workers on the front lines to protect their health and safety and that of others. If workers do become ill out of and in the course of their employment, workers' compensation should normally be provided. Compensation boards need to adapt their requirements of all injured workers in light of current challenges to the health care system. Lots of workers will be falling through the cracks of a very uneven social safety net in Canada, primarily provincially regulated with regard to labour legislation, and federally regulated, with regard to Employment Insurance. In other words, it is highly likely that some workers will not be able to pay their rent or feed their families if the current crisis is to go on for weeks or even months. Our governments need to take more action. Legislation improving Labour Standards and Workers' Compensation coverage is required to ensure that all workers who are absent because of illness or in quarantine should be guaranteed economic support while they are away, regardless of their contractual status. They should not be required to produce sick notes by their employers and they should be protected from reprisals if they are absent for health reasons. New measures should be introduced to protect the jobs of workers who are unable to work because of COVID-19. Provinces should enact temporary prohibition of evictions for nonpayment of rent. It sometimes takes a crisis to reveal all the fault lines in our flawed social safety nets. We can weather the difficulties arising from COVID-19, but only if we face it together and make sure to leave no one in Canada behind.

Ministry of the Attorney General spokesperson Jesse Robichaud confirmed the news in an email to the Star Monday evening. ""In addition, Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week,"" she added. The news comes as tenant advocates pushed for the province to freeze evictions, a move that several U.S. cities, including New York and San Francisco, have already made. Freelance illustrator and artist Paterson Hodgson called it ""a no-brainer"" and said she'd also like to see a rent freeze. She said there's a lot of worry amongst the neighbours in her highrise building. Many are facing reduced hours if not layoffs, as well as the ""financial burden"" of stocking up for possible self-isolation. ""The idea that someone could have no home during these very unsure times is very scary,"" she said, in an interview before the decision. Parkdale legal clinic worker Cole Webber joined legal clinic workers, lawyers and other advocates in the city in sending a letter to the Ministry of the Attorney General and the executive chair of Tribunals Ontario on Sunday calling for an immediate eviction freeze ""in the midst of a pandemic."" It was not immediately clear how long scheduled enforcement of eviction orders would be postponed for. Benjamin Ries, a lawyer and member of the Greater Toronto Clinic Housing Advocates, who signed off on the letter, said in an interview before the decision was made that there is firstly a ""fairness issue, with people losing income for reasons that are entirely beyond their control."" But there's also a public health reason to stop evictions. There's ""overwhelming evidence"" that homelessness, even temporarily, leads to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalization, and there's also some evidence it can lead to incarceration, Ries said.

They will witness the closing of the world's longest border, the one separating their country from the United States, to all but economically essential travel. As extreme a measure as it may seem, the governments of both countries were correct to adopt it because it will limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed 10,000 lives around the world. Desperate times justify desperate actions. And Ottawa was also right to ban travel into Canada from everywhere else in the world, except for the citizens and permanent residents of this country returning home. But while Canadians can applaud the federal government for taking these protective steps, they should hope that such wide-ranging restrictions, which are now in place in 91 countries, do not outlast the pandemic itself. That, unfortunately, is not a given. Across the political spectrum, critics of open borders and the free movement of goods and services are wrongly blaming globalization for COVID-19 and its fallout. Donald Trump and his right-wing, populist supporters claim the pandemic proves borders must be tightened to keep out foreigners and ""foreign"" illnesses — which is how the American president wrongly refers to COVID-19. At the same time, some left-of-centre critics of capitalism argue the pandemic's disruption of supply chains and its contribution to an impending global recession demonstrate the need for drastic economic reforms. They advocate reverting to the more locally oriented — and far poorer — markets of bygone days. The critics on both sides are wrong. We do not need more xenophobic walls or protectionist barriers in this world. Globalization should not become another casualty of COVID-19, and Canadians, of all people, should realize this. Canada is a trading country with a third of its wealth coming from its exports. Since the late 20th century, as Canada forged new trading alliances with the U.S., then Mexico and later both the European Union and a host of Pacific Rim counties, this country has prospered as never before. Canada is a country of immigrants that has been built over centuries and continues to be built today by newcomers from around the planet. In addition, Canada is a nation of travelers, with an estimated three million of its citizens now living abroad. Thanks to the open — but managed — borders that allow both immigrants into Canada and Canadians into other countries, Canada is enriched by a steady flow of new ideas, new innovations and new connections. And as Canada has joined the movement to open international borders elsewhere, hundreds of millions of people around the world have benefitted. While the World Bank estimates that 44 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty as recently as 1981, that number had fallen to 8.6 per cent by 2018. The sharp increase in international trade and global migration contributed to this remarkable progress. We know this pandemic is as unsettling as it is frightening. When the world has put this crisis behind it — as it will — there will be time for reflection, review and necessary changes to reduce the odds of a future pandemic that is so debilitating. But this is not the time for misdiagnosis. We should remember that centuries before the era of globalization, jet travel and modern supply chains, the world was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox and influenza. Closed borders, closed economies and closed minds aren't the cure to what ails humanity. International co-operation and the eventual return to a more open world are.

Telcos giving their customers unlimited data. Chicken farmers making large donations to local food banks. Airlines providing free flights back to Canada. Examples of corporate benevolence, if we can call it that, are showing up everywhere in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. More of this please. It's easy to get dragged down by stories about unscrupulous behaviour - the price-gougers, the employers who demand that workers show up, the malls that won't shut down or the workplaces that are just careless about social distancing. But, anecdotally at least, examples of benevolent measures by employers seem to outweigh the nasty. So where should corporate leaders who want to help Canada get through this focus their energy? Economic policy-makers are freeing up billions of dollars to bridge the coronavirus economy for Canada's deeply troubled business sectors and the people who work in them. CEOs should make that public money work even more effectively by thinking hard about how to help underwrite a collapsing workforce. Their efforts need not be driven by altruism alone. If they don't want to wait for years to see a reasonably functioning economy when this is all over, there are compelling business reasons to take some responsibility and help shoulder the burden now. The federally regulated sectors of the economy seem already to understand this. Commercial banks are showing welcome flexibility by opening the doors to their indebted customers and renegotiating loans and mortgages if need be, formally committing to leniency on a case-by-case basis. The telecommunications companies and the airlines are helping out, too - telcos by allowing unlimited data to encourage working from home, and airlines by flying half-empty planes to bring Canadians back home from abroad. (Sunwing even offered free seats on Thursday.) Both of those industries benefit from federal regulation, and it's part of the bargain. The country helps them all the time; they need to help us right now. ""This is reciprocity,"" said economist Jim Stanford. But there will need to be a lot more of this kind of thinking if we have any hope of a speedy economic recovery when this crisis finally ends. It's in corporate Canada's best interest to figure out ways to keep workers on the payroll, even if there's no revenue coming in, says Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. That's because there was a labour shortage before coronavirus brought many businesses to a standstill, and it's fair to expect that it will return when the pandemic is over. Failing that, corporations need to lay off workers cleanly so that they can quickly qualify for Employment Insurance, says David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. That's what Noront Resources did for its workforce of 20 mainly Indigenous workers in remote northern Ontario, says vice-president Glenn Nolan. Knowing the workers were susceptible to contagion because they often come from overcrowded communities with weak health care systems, the company laid them off, sent them home with severance and promised to call them back when the virus has calmed down. The top corporate responsibility, however, is staving off bankruptcy in whatever way possible. A company that closes its doors can't simply come back to life when the crisis abates. But keeping those doors open will be easier said than done. Revenues have dropped off a cliff in the hospitality, airline, tourism, oil and gas, and retail sectors, and we are in deep trouble in manufacturing and exports. Corporate goodwill will be necessary to getting through this, but it won't be enough. As Stanford noted, ""It's not going to be charity that saves us here. It's going to be government intervention and planning."" Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.
