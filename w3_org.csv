O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

The XHTML specifications are developed by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group as part of the W3C HTML Activity. For more information about XML, please refer to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 specification. Version date: 2010-01-27 1. Introduction XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] permits the development of XHTML modules and XHTML family markup languages. These modules and markup languages may, in turn, define local vocabulary items for use as values of attributes. This document describes the items that are available in the default XHTML vocabulary space: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#. 2.

Note that unlike all other XML namespaces, both the name and the prefix are specified; i.e., if you want XML 1.0 processors to recognize this namespace, you must use the reserved prefix xml:. xml:lang and xml:space As of the last update of this document, the XML 1.0 Specification (Fifth edition) (and also the XML 1.1 Specification Second edition) defines two attribute names in this namespace: xml:lang Designed for identifying the human language used in the scope of the element to which it's attached. xml:space Designed to express whether or not the document's creator wishes white space to be considered as significant in the scope of the element to which it's attached. xml:base The XML Base specification (Second edition) describes a facility, similar to that of HTML BASE, for defining base URIs for parts of XML documents. It defines a single attribute, xml:base, and describes in detail the procedure for its use in processing relative URI refeferences. xml:id The xml:id specification defines a single attribute, xml:id, known to be of type ID independently of any DTD or schema. Father denotes Jon Bosak, the chair of the original XML Working Group. This name is reserved by the following decision of the W3C XML Plenary and XML Coordination groups: In appreciation for his vision, leadership and dedication the W3C XML Plenary on this 10th day of February, 2000, reserves for Jon Bosak in perpetuity the XML name ""xml:Father"". Namespace change policy The XML Core Working Group reserves the right to bring additional names from this namespace into active use by providing definitions for them in new specifications or subsequent editions of existing specifications. The Working Group may also make modifications to the definitions of the names already in use, although such changes will not normally change the well-formedness or validity of existing documents or significantly change their meaning. All changes to the use of this namespace will be achieved by the publication of documents governed by the W3C Process. Other names beginning 'xml' The XML specification reserves all names beginning with the letters 'x', 'm', 'l' in any combination of upper- and lower-case for use by the W3C. To date three such names have been given definitions—although these names are not in the XML namespace, they are listed here as a convenience to readers and users: xml See the XML declaration and the XML namespace prefix xmlns See namespace declarations xml-stylesheet See The xml-stylesheet processing instruction Related Resources Section 2.10 of the XML 1.0 specification describes the syntax and semantics of the xml:space attribute. Section 2.12 of the XML 1.0 specification describes the syntax and semantics of the xml:lang attribute. An XML Schema fragment is available which constrains the syntax of xml:lang, xml:space, xml:base and xml:id in the schema language defined by the XML Schema Recommendation, Second Edition, of 28 October 2004. (An XML Schema fragment for the CR version of XML Schema is still available as well.) The value of the xml:lang attribute must be as specified by BCP 47, or be empty.

The XHTML specifications are developed by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group as part of the W3C HTML Activity. For more information about XML, please refer to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 specification. Version date: 2010-01-27 1. Introduction XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] permits the development of XHTML modules and XHTML family markup languages. These modules and markup languages may, in turn, define local vocabulary items for use as values of attributes. This document describes the items that are available in the default XHTML vocabulary space: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#. 2.

The XHTML specifications are developed by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group as part of the W3C HTML Activity. For more information about XML, please refer to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 specification. Version date: 2010-01-27 1. Introduction XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] permits the development of XHTML modules and XHTML family markup languages. These modules and markup languages may, in turn, define local vocabulary items for use as values of attributes. This document describes the items that are available in the default XHTML vocabulary space: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#. 2. XHTML Metainformation Vocabulary The XHTML Metainformation Module defined as part of XHTML+RDFa [XHTMLRDFa] specifies the following vocabulary items. alternate alternate designates alternate versions for a resource. appendix appendix refers to a resource serving as an appendix in a collection. bookmark bookmark refers to a bookmark - a link to a key entry point within an extended document. cite cite refers to a resource that defines a citation. chapter chapter refers to a resource serving as a chapter in a collection. contents contents refers to a resource serving as a table of contents. copyright copyright refers to a copyright statement for the resource. first first refers the first item in a collection (see also start and top). glossary glossary refers to a resource providing a glossary of terms. help help refers to a resource offering help. icon icon refers to a resource that represents an icon. index index refers to a resource providing an index. itsRules itsRules indicates that the designated resource is an [ITS] rule set. last last refers to the last resource in a collection of resources. license license refers to a resource that defines the associated license. meta meta refers to a resource that provides metadata. next next refers to the next resource (after the current one) in an ordered collection of resources. p3pv1 p3pv1 refers to a P3P Policy Reference File [P3P]. prev prev refers to a previous resource (before the current one) in an ordered collection of resources. role role indicates the purpose of the resource.

Note that unlike all other XML namespaces, both the name and the prefix are specified; i.e., if you want XML 1.0 processors to recognize this namespace, you must use the reserved prefix xml:. xml:lang and xml:space As of the last update of this document, the XML 1.0 Specification (Fifth edition) (and also the XML 1.1 Specification Second edition) defines two attribute names in this namespace: xml:lang Designed for identifying the human language used in the scope of the element to which it's attached. xml:space Designed to express whether or not the document's creator wishes white space to be considered as significant in the scope of the element to which it's attached. xml:base The XML Base specification (Second edition) describes a facility, similar to that of HTML BASE, for defining base URIs for parts of XML documents. It defines a single attribute, xml:base, and describes in detail the procedure for its use in processing relative URI refeferences. xml:id The xml:id specification defines a single attribute, xml:id, known to be of type ID independently of any DTD or schema. Father denotes Jon Bosak, the chair of the original XML Working Group. This name is reserved by the following decision of the W3C XML Plenary and XML Coordination groups: In appreciation for his vision, leadership and dedication the W3C XML Plenary on this 10th day of February, 2000, reserves for Jon Bosak in perpetuity the XML name ""xml:Father"". Namespace change policy The XML Core Working Group reserves the right to bring additional names from this namespace into active use by providing definitions for them in new specifications or subsequent editions of existing specifications. The Working Group may also make modifications to the definitions of the names already in use, although such changes will not normally change the well-formedness or validity of existing documents or significantly change their meaning. All changes to the use of this namespace will be achieved by the publication of documents governed by the W3C Process. Other names beginning 'xml' The XML specification reserves all names beginning with the letters 'x', 'm', 'l' in any combination of upper- and lower-case for use by the W3C. To date three such names have been given definitions—although these names are not in the XML namespace, they are listed here as a convenience to readers and users: xml See the XML declaration and the XML namespace prefix xmlns See namespace declarations xml-stylesheet See The xml-stylesheet processing instruction Related Resources Section 2.10 of the XML 1.0 specification describes the syntax and semantics of the xml:space attribute. Section 2.12 of the XML 1.0 specification describes the syntax and semantics of the xml:lang attribute. An XML Schema fragment is available which constrains the syntax of xml:lang, xml:space, xml:base and xml:id in the schema language defined by the XML Schema Recommendation, Second Edition, of 28 October 2004.

These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.

O.1 Introduction The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’ attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered deprecated.
