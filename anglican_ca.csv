Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact our information centre.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact our information centre. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact our information centre.

The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Welcome to the Anglican Church of Canada. We are a people seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus in serving God’s mission. We invite you to join us. Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us. Better yet, drop by your local Anglican church for a service or to ask a clergy out for coffee.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Our mission statement (aussi disponible en français): As a partner in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal Church, we proclaim and celebrate the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship and action. We value our heritage of biblical faith, reason, liturgy, tradition, bishops and synods, and the rich variety of our life in community. We acknowledge that God is calling us to greater diversity of membership, wider participation in ministry and leadership, better stewardship in God’s creation and a stronger resolve in challenging attitudes and structures that cause injustice. Guided by the Holy Spirit, we commit ourselves to respond to this call in love and service and so more fully live the life of Christ. The Anglican Church of Canada does not define its doctrine in a single confession. Our beliefs are articulated in our liturgies, as well as in these selected statements: Anglican tradition affirms three historic creeds: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Solemn Declaration (1893) united the Anglican Church of Canada as a national church and defined its relationship to the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Quadrilateral (1888) defined the commonalities of churches in the Anglican Communion and has also served as a basis for ecumenical discussion. The 39 Articles of Religion were a foundational document for the Church of England during the Reformation. Current work at General Synod is shaped by the Five Marks of Mission, used widely throughout the Anglican Communion.

Canadian Anglicans are a diverse community. We worship in small chapels and large churches. Some of us worship with guitars and drums, while others prefer organs and choirs. We speak many languages. All Anglican worship is grounded in common prayer. Our traditional text is the Book of Common Prayer, but our churches also use the Book of Alternative Services. We invite you to read more about our beliefs, our organization, our history, and what to expect when you visit an Anglican church. To learn more, contact us.
