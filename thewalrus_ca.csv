Why did it take a pandemic? April 29, 2020May 1, 2020 - by Angela MisriAngela Misri Illustration by Dalbert B. Vilarino, Updated 16:00, May. 1, 2020 | Published 13:04, Apr. 29, 2020 Since the first website went live, in 1991, the digital world has fractured in many ways, enabling bad behaviour, like revenge porn and cyberbullying, and becoming an archive of the worst of humanity. But, in the midst of a global pandemic, as so many of us sit in isolation, the World Wide Web has started to reflect what its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, imagined: a collective of ideas shared not for glory or financial gain but for the betterment of human knowledge. Between video-conferencing companies like Zoom offering free upgrades for schools, Canadian telecommunications businesses waiving roaming and long-distance fees while many of us work from home, and Uber delivering food to health care workers for free, the digital ecosystem is seeing a boom of organizational altruism. This support seems to extend to human interactions online as well. People are connecting more with far-flung friends. Strangers on Twitter are offering to give money to help pay others’ expenses. Mental health professionals, yoga teachers, and authors are offering their services virtually—and for free—to help stave off the cabin fever of self-isolation. Even on Reddit, that sometime cesspool of vitriol, Bill Gates hosted an AMA (ask me anything) with both his chief scientific adviser and the head of the Gates Foundation’s global health work. With the help of these doctors, Gates answered questions on subjects like coronavirus testing, how to teach safety during a pandemic, and when we can reasonably expect a vaccine. How Technology Can Fill the Gaps in Our Mental Health System The Rise of the Tech-Savvy Parent How YouTube Gives Us Love Without the Messiness It’s true that other global events in the internet era have resulted in virtual support, like that directed toward the the FDNY and the people of New York after the attacks on 9/11. But these moments were also overshadowed by hateful rhetoric. Misinformation seemed to spread as quickly as the facts. While misinformation, racism, and violence are still issues under this pandemic, the citizens of the World Wide Web seem more committed to the things that make us the same—our fear and resolve in the face of COVID-19. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) when he came up with a way for researchers working on different computers to share information. It took another year for that proposal, originally called Mesh, to develop into the earliest version of the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee’s boss at the time put his initial proposal aside but allowed him to begin writing the code that Berners-Lee believed could become the architecture for real-time document sharing. The beginnings of the internet already existed thanks to ARPANET and funding from the US Department of Defense, but it was Berners-Lee who became instrumental in making it accessible to the wider public. Back in those heady early days, the web was a benevolent place where many coders and programmers shared their work for free. In April 1993, CERN and Berners-Lee put the World Wide Web software into the public domain, giving the underlying code an open licence—royalty free, forever. The following year, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium, an international community dedicated to developing web standards and recommendations and promoting core values of openness, interoperability, and vendor neutrality. Anything that went against those founding principles—be it developers, software, or code—presented the risk of causing tension in the growing community. This kind of cooperative ownership seems to have led to a mentality that we should not have to pay for things that are basically free to post if not free to create. Remember when we had to buy the whole album even if we only liked one song on it? Now, it’s become a pay-what-you-want adventure as we bounce between music platforms, dodging both ads and financial responsibilities. To this day, traditional industries—most notably print media—struggle to replicate the earning ability of the pre-internet era. But the belief that the internet was free and owned by everyone who used it also lowered the standards of discourse. Anyone was allowed to post anything, and the anonymity meant that there were very little real-life repercussions. The pendulum swung from benevolent, cooperative beginnings to the dark side of human nature, where communities could gather around ideas of violence and hate. But, as the pandemic is showing, that same power in numbers might make it possible to wrest the web back from the dark side. Pandemics of the past, from the Black Death to the Spanish flu, spread misinformation and fear almost as intensely as the viruses themselves moved through populations. In the mid-1300s, when the bubonic plague peaked, a primary way of sharing information was through word of mouth, which moved too slowly to keep pace with the spread of the virus. While those who first fell victim to the disease were being buried, Europeans and Asians in surrounding areas who had yet to encounter the disease were casually going about their lives, unaware that the plague would spread along trade routes, on ships, and through towns. Beginning in 1918, the Spanish flu—so named because the uncensored Spanish journalists were able to report on it openly during the war, not because of the mistaken assumption that it originated in Spain—would go on to have an estimated death toll of up to 100 million people worldwide. It killed an estimated 50,000 to 55,000 Canadians and resulted in the creation of the federal Department of Health, but the news of its lethality did not dominate the media. Moreover, information on its severity and spread was likely underreported due to censorship of the press in light of the war effort. In the papers, news of the pandemic was often subordinated to coverage of the war. Sometimes, articles about the illness didn’t even make it to the front page. Canada wasn’t the only one making this mistake. Several local authorities in countries like Italy and the US minimized the severity of the outbreak by denying death tolls or the strength of transmissibility. Wilmer Krusen, Philadelphia’s public health director, is largely remembered in history for downplaying the disease to the public. While other public health professionals were wary of allowing mass gatherings, Krusen allowed the Philadelphia Liberty Loan Parade to proceed as planned. By the spring of 1919, an estimated 12,000 people had died from the Spanish flu in Philadelphia. Pandemics of the past didn’t have the communications network that the web offers us today. With COVID-19, the internet warned us that a new disease was spreading very early in our initial discovery of it, even as some government officials downplayed its severity. Late last December, Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang used WeChat to tell his fellow medics about a SARS-like virus he was noticing in his patients. Chinese authorities did their best to shut down his communications, but by then, the cap was off. The internet passed around first-person stories and on-the-ground data and awareness grew, though many people and governments around the world were slower to react. Around the time the virus was declared a pandemic, when media companies like Fox News were claiming that the situation was being blown out of proportion by the Democrats, the truth was retweeted and reposted and pushed higher up on our feeds. At the same time, while people had access to information, they also had the choice to ignore it. With more people getting their news from social media—where algorithms can foreground information aligned with your interests and exclude what you don’t engage with—there was a risk that the apparent seriousness of the situation would test differently depending on one’s world view. But the information did get out, as did anecdotal COVID-19 stories from people as famous as Tom Hanks and Idris Elba. First-person accounts became more widespread, and as the death tolls continued to rise, so did the stories from medical professionals, tear-filled journaling in real-time on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook. It felt like an uncharacteristic and unprecedented groundswell of authentic conversation. And it’s exactly what we needed to remind us why we have an internet. There’s a terrible stereotype about the highly engaged internet user—that he’s a dude living in his mom’s basement in filth and misery, angry at the world and willing to anonymously attack anyone from behind the safety of his screen. That person may still exist, but the engaged internet user in 2020 is all of us who are using the web as a way to stay updated and stave off the loneliness of our isolated lives. Trolls and scammers didn’t go dark under threat of pandemic and are still making use of the internet to confuse and steal from us, including making false information go viral. But software companies are responding by creating new measures to shut those actions down. Amazon has identified hoarders and barred them from reselling, Twitter and Facebook have committed to identifying and removing pandemic-related content that could cause harm, and companies are taking action to combat the rampant spread of misinformation. People are fighting over toilet paper in grocery stores and governments are considering formal charges against citizens who break quarantine, but the temperature of the internet still seems remarkably positive, factual, and supportive overall. It will be interesting to see if the web still feels this way when we start easing back into our regular lives. We’re all (willing or unwilling) participants in what The Atlantic has aptly called “the world’s largest natural experiment in behavior change.” The question is: Can we make these changes permanent? Can we move the dial of discourse back closer to what Berners-Lee intended? Last year, in a speech reflecting on the World Wide Web’s thirtieth birthday, Berners-Lee called the fight for the web one of the most important fights of our time. “Citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart,” he said. “If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web, if we don’t do our part to foster constructive, healthy conversations online, if we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agendas of our governments.” If the majority of us go back to ignoring the parts of the web we find upsetting and only sharing information within our bubbles, then we will lose the progress we’ve made during this time—when the power shifted back toward a strong, collaborative digital community.

At the time, he was a family physician at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital who, thanks to his background in public health, had found himself in charge of enforcing the quarantine of hundreds of people; all told, more than 25,000 people in the Toronto area were kept isolated for ten-day stretches in their homes. Upshur understood that the practice raised plenty of ethical issues: Was it a proportionate response to the risk? Did restricting individual freedoms prevent a greater harm to society? Could the government ensure that the needs of those in isolation would still be met? But he was also curious: Just how bad did Canadians think it was to violate a quarantine order? Was it like running a stop sign? Was it like roughing someone up? Was it like . . . killing them? The Canadians surveyed back then gave the question some thought, and a full half of them concluded that, yes, breaking quarantine was the equivalent of manslaughter. An additional 27 percent compared it to felony assault. “We were shocked when we got the results,” Upshur says. “We went, ‘Holy crow, Canada is really bullish on quarantine!’” Over a decade later, this bullishness has served the country well in its far more difficult fight against the far more infectious sars-CoV-2. Canadians have, by a significant majority, been very supportive of the widespread distancing measures required to bring the pandemic under control. Once the entire country had the distinct experience of sheltering in place for months, though, and once places like Germany and New Zealand declared the first phase of this long pandemic behind them, we turned antsy and started eyeing the exits. Unfortunately, shutting a nation down is considerably easier than opening it back up. Politicians and public health officials are attempting to figure out, in real time, just what it takes to safely emerge from an extended state of mass quarantine—and what exactly life will look like over the twelve or eighteen or twenty-four months that may still stand between us and a vaccine. Your Brain on COVID-19 Anatomy of a Pandemic This Is the Internet We Were Promised Even health economists, who model epidemic-mitigation strategies, are working in uncharted territory with sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the illness of covid-19. “A lot of the pandemic plans around the world are based on influenza, where you don’t need to develop a whole new vaccine,” so containment measures can be more nuanced, says Beate Sander, Canada research chair in economics of infectious disease. As the h1n1 influenza virus spread in 2009, she helped produce a study that examined the costs of different interventions to curb the disease. “School closures were the wildest scenario we tried,” Sander says. “You couldn’t even think about the situation now, with covid-19—it [would have seemed] just so far out there.” The introduction of restrictive measures in Canada seemed—like falling in love or going bankrupt—to happen slowly, then all at once. First travel alerts were issued, then schools were shut down, then states of emergency declared across provinces; within days, aside from the once-weekly grocery trips and two-metre-buffer strolls that turned us all into anxious geometers, those who weren’t essential workers just stayed home. As the lockdown stretched on, however, excitement started to build around schemes that might get us out of it. Politicians, talking heads, news reports, and uncles on Facebook went through exuberant periods of discovery, touting the possibilities of antibody tests or immunity passports or contact-tracing apps that would ping if you had come too close to someone who later tested positive for covid-19. But the coronavirus pandemic is a complex, hydra-headed creature wreaking considerable havoc—3.3 million people infected worldwide in its first four months—and these strategies don’t amount to a silver bullet: some won’t work, some shouldn’t, and some can’t yet. “It’s very difficult to know what to do in this type of situation,” Sander says. Comparisons to previous health emergencies offer limited guidance: although sars hit Toronto hard, it remained relatively contained around the world, while Ebola was not a respiratory illness. “With covid-19, you have a virus that spreads very easily, often among asymptomatic people, and can still cause quite severe disease,” Sander says. “I don’t have examples for how to go about relaxing interventions.” “Everyone is looking for the cavalry to come,” Upshur says. “We want an approach that’s going to get us out of here quickly. But I’ve worked on pandemic preparedness since the mid-’90s. You learn one thing: respect the virus.” When a new virus invades the human body, the two branches of our immune system set to work. First up is the innate immune system, the foundational protection against pathogens. “It recognizes that something foreign and noxious has entered our bodies, and it turns on all sorts of alarm signals,” says Jennifer Gommerman, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto. The innate immune system generates antiviral proteins called interferons, which, fittingly, interfere with a virus in order to limit its ability to reproduce. While this system is critical, “it’s not exactly a special-ops team,” she says. “It’s more like a barrier that the immune system puts up to deal with the virus.” That barrier causes a ton of collateral damage: you get a fever, which helps power up the immune system to fight off infection, and are left feeling lousy. Over time, this crude defensive effort gives way to the adaptive immune system, a more sophisticated response that emerges once the body has had a chance to learn about a virus and tailor its counterattack. We have a seemingly limitless repertoire of lymphocytes, the subtype of white blood cells that are fine-tuned to respond to the particular protein causing all the chaos. Those lymphocytes produce giant quantities of antibodies, which target a virus’s vulnerabilities, prevent it from hijacking host cells, and clear it from our system. The adaptive immune system also has the ability to remember that virus, so if you’re reinfected with it, your lymphocytes respond quickly and vigorously, generating immunity to the pathogen. The tricky bit is that, if your body has never seen a virus before—a virus, let’s say, like sars-CoV-2—it can take one to three weeks for those lymphocytes to start working. The innate immune system is a sledgehammer: it assumes that a threat could spread anywhere. Quarantine is a sledgehammer too: it assumes the same about all of us. Most diseases circulating in our population have been around long enough that we’ve either acquired natural immunity, thanks to the long memory of our adaptive immune systems, or we’ve developed a vaccine. This way, when an outbreak occurs—as it did last summer with measles in Montreal—it unfolds against a backdrop of some existing immunity, so efforts to contain the spread can be more surgically applied to the individuals and places at risk. But no one had developed any immunity to sars-CoV-2 because no one had contended with this coronavirus before. “We very rarely see a completely susceptible population,” says Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. “That’s why we’re all hiding in our houses—because a very good way to keep the infected people away from the susceptible people is to keep everybody away from everybody else.” But, also like the innate immune system, quarantine causes all manner of collateral damage. Nearly 6 million Canadians applied for covid-19 employment benefits in the first month of the pandemic alone. In some parts of the country, rates of domestic violence have risen as much as 30 percent. Close to 100,000 people had their surgeries cancelled or postponed in order to free up hospital beds for covid-19 patients, the cbc found. And half of us reported in a recent poll that our mental health had deteriorated as a result of the uncertainty and isolation. So, until a vaccine arrives, how can we build the equivalent of an adaptive immune system for covid-19—targeting our response only where it’s needed instead of everywhere at once? How do we trade the sledgehammer for a scalpel? During the first wave of the pandemic, Canada, like most countries, followed the spread of covid-19 by testing people who had symptoms of the illness. That’s done through polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests, which detect markers of the sars-CoV-2 genome in the genetic material collected in a nasal swab. pcr tests will be crucial throughout the pandemic to diagnose new cases of covid-19 because they identify traces of the virus while it is still present in our bodies—they tell us where the virus is now. But those traces vanish once antibodies have cleared it from our systems, so pcr tests neither reveal where the virus has been nor offer a picture of all the people who’ve had it. For that, you need to look at a person’s blood serum through a serology test. These tests scour for particular antibodies to sars-CoV-2; the most refined of them can search specifically for antibodies that meddle with the interaction between the sars-CoV-2 spikes—the knobby, crown-like proteins that give coronaviruses their name—and receptors on the surfaces of our own cells. Determining how many people have developed antibodies illustrates the progression of sars-CoV-2 through a population, which is vital for establishing a more nuanced response to the disease. That’s why, as restrictions loosened and focus shifted to managing covid-19 until the appearance of effective therapies or a vaccine, serological testing gained traction. The UK announced a large-scale study that aimed to test upwards of 20,000 people in its first wave and 300,000 within a year. In the Netherlands, where as many as 10,000 people donate blood each week, serological tests are now part of screenings. At the University of Toronto and Sinai Health, researchers across disciplines have collaborated on a robotic system that can detect the antibody response in up to 10,000 blood samples a day. In each of these serological surveys, the goal is to monitor the virus’s prevalence within communities in order to better understand how immunity might be developing and how deadly covid-19 is proving to be. For all our talk about the curve, there’s an equally important shape in epidemiology: the pyramid of disease severity. Deaths are at the very top of the pyramid, followed by hospitalizations, then ER visits. Below that, there are the people who consult their doctors, and then, at the bottom, those who are sick but never seek medical care. “We see the more severe outcomes: the hospitalizations and the deaths,” Tuite says. “We’re less good at finding the less severe outcomes, which tend to be much more frequent.” Serological testing helps epidemiologists fill in the base of the pyramid so they can use that information to make more precise estimates of how many susceptible people remain. But what if, policy makers mused, serology testing could benefit not just the community but recovered individuals as well? The idea—floated by countries including Germany, Italy, the UK, and Chile—is that a positive antibody test could locate the lucky citizens whose immunity would allow them to rejoin the workforce and anchor the economy while physical distancing continues. These individuals would qualify for an immunity passport, some sort of government-issued documentation that would permit them to leave the house, head into the office, or shop for groceries with zero concern about catching the illness. In Canada, Kumanan Wilson, a specialist in general internal medicine at The Ottawa Hospital, has been investigating the ways proof of immunity might work here. Eight years ago, Wilson and his colleagues created the mobile national immunization app CANImmunize, and now he is collaborating with Canada Health Infoway, a federally funded nonprofit, to determine how best to issue digital certificates to people who are no longer susceptible to covid-19. “It would be almost like a boarding pass, with a scannable bar code that says you have the requisite lab results that identify you as immune,” Wilson says. That certificate could then be scanned before entry is granted to sports arenas, airports, or large gatherings. “When Trudeau says twelve to eighteen months for a vaccine, people are looking to whether there’s anything we can do before then,” Wilson says. “It’s a bit Orwellian—it’s not an ideal solution. But we’re not living in an ideal situation now.” In early may, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche racked up international headlines when it revealed details of its sars-CoV-2 serology test—one far more promising than any yet on the market. Germany struck a deal to purchase 3 million of the tests that month and 5 million for every month that followed. The US Food and Drug Administration also cleared the test for emergency use. (Health Canada had not, by that time, approved the sale of any serology test.) There are two ways to measure the accuracy of a serology test, and on both counts, Roche’s numbers are unmatched. For its sensitivity—how well the test identifies the people who have had sars-CoV-2 and developed antibodies to it—Roche says it works 100 percent of the time. That means every positive is a true positive; there are no false negatives, where you have the antibodies but the test says you don’t. Still, says Brenda Fine, an instructor in the mathematics department at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, “that’s the kind of error we don’t care as much about. Someone is safe to go out, but we don’t send them.” Then there’s the specificity of the test: how well it rules out the people who have not developed the requisite antibodies. Those are the true negatives. Roche claims a specificity of 99.8 percent, which means that 0.2 percent of the time, the test will give a false positive. “That’s the dangerous mistake,” Fine says. “Those are the people who, according to the test, are good to go to work, to a play, to a party, when they’re not safe at all.” A 0.2 percent error rate sounds pretty good. But the extent of that mistake hinges on the prevalence of sars-CoV-2 in a population: how many people have or have had the disease. The lower the prevalence, the higher the number of false positives. In a community of 1 million people, for example, with a prevalence of 50 percent, 500,000 people would still be susceptible to the virus. Roche’s error rate means that 1,000 of them would get a false positive. When prevalence is 10 percent and 900,000 people are susceptible, 1,800 of them would be incorrectly told they have antibodies. When prevalence is 1 percent, that number rises to 1,980. The greater the population, the worse the consequences. In a country of 40 million, with a prevalence of 1 percent, nearly 80,000 people would be under the mistaken impression that they were safe from covid-19. That’s why, however much we might all wish otherwise, serological tests can’t give any single person a clean bill of health or enable them to blithely bypass distancing protocols. The better the group fares—the lower the prevalence of the illness in the population—the less we’re in a position to know how any individual within the group will do. “I’ve worked on pandemic preparedness since the mid-’90s. You learn one thing: respect the virus.” So just how prevalent is this virus? The World Health Organization’s best guess for the global population is 2 or 3 percent. In Canada, we haven’t a clue. “Because the pcr testing was so poorly done, especially at the beginning, there are so many people who were asymptomatic and could have transmitted it,” says Anne-Claude Gingras, a senior investigator at Sinai Health’s Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. “We don’t know if we’re dealing with a prevalence of 0.1 percent or 1 percent or 10 percent.” Those people given false positives aren’t just risking their own health by rejoining the outside world—they’re well positioned to then spread the virus to others, causing new community outbreaks. The same thing that makes serological testing so crucial for a community makes it so risky for any one user to rely on its results. We’re still completely in the dark. What’s more, prevalence is going to vary region by region, city by city: Canada might well have an average national immunity of 10 percent, but those rates will look very different in Vancouver, which was initially hit hard by the virus, and in Charlottetown, where cases are low. “At this stage, I don’t know why we’re talking about national policy,” Fine says. “That might be useful if we were thinking about flying across the country, but we’re still at the stage where we’re wondering if we walk to the store a kilometre away. This is something for cities to decide one at a time.” Upshur, now an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, agrees: “Most of the countries that have managed the pandemic have been islands or small populations,” he says. “Canada is so huge that this is going to have to be done on a local level.” Even if we did manage to devise an absolutely iron-clad serology test, one that never returned false positives at all, it still wouldn’t be a perfect solution—because scientists don’t yet have any clear sense of how natural immunity to sars-CoV-2 works or how long it will last. “The immunity of respiratory viruses is extremely tricky,” Upshur says. “They mutate quickly and, for some reason, unlike measles or mumps, we don’t get this permanent, enduring immunity.” Immunity could perhaps last two years, as with the first sars; it could also be more like six months. We won’t know until we have the benefit of two, three, five years’ hindsight. “It’s really nice to think that serology is going to come to the rescue, but I’m not convinced it’s going to be the tool people think it is at the current time,” Upshur says. As for immunity certificates? There, he’s less inclined to hedge. “The idea that we would have anything like an immunity passport is science fiction.” As the great plague advanced through seventeenth-century London, red-painted crosses sprouted on sealed wooden doors: the stamp of the infected. In 1940s Canada, yellow quarantine signs took their place, alerting passersby to the polio or whooping cough or diphtheria that lurked inside. Immunity certificates reverse the indicator—here, it’s the healthy who are marked. Maybe that’s enough to mean the idea “actually might have some merit, under certain circumstances,” as US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said in April. As politicians (both the elected and armchair kind) have argued, even in the absence of a foolproof test or a better understanding of the illness, this lockdown can’t continue indefinitely. Trade-offs need to be made: a little more covid-19, a little less economic pain. Does that tip the balance in favour of these passports? Not when the effect would still be to divide families, workplaces, communities, and the country into two castes: the immune and the vulnerable. “You’ve introduced an ‘us’ and a ‘them’—you’re a vector of danger, you are to be feared, whereas I am the good, clean one,” says Françoise Baylis, a professor of bioethics at Dalhousie University. “That’s deeply problematic. It’s a bifurcation of the world.” It creates enormous ethical and social concerns. To begin, it means that the prize for everyone who has faithfully obeyed the rules and avoided unnecessary contact—and therefore the illness—is that they must keep sheltering in place for some unknown period of time. “You went home from work, you took the financial hit, and now the government is setting a precedent that says, ‘Well, we’re glad you followed the rules, but you don’t get to go back to work because you haven’t been infected and you haven’t survived it,’” Baylis says. That also makes it difficult for public officials to come back at the outset of a new wave of cases and ask citizens to quarantine again. “Why would you do that the second time around? Why would you believe that you should?” In a world where immunity is rewarded, there is every likelihood that some people would start to take chances with covid-19 not out of carelessness or frustration but as a conscious choice to contract it—that they would endanger their own health because they’ve been punished for their efforts to preserve it. “There are people who are particularly desperate to get back to work,” Baylis says. “If this is the only way, haven’t you created an incentive for them to get themselves infected?” There’s also the not-inconsiderable dilemma of how a system like this would be designed and enforced. “Are you talking fines? Are you talking imprisonment? Are you going to spot-check? Is this going to be a visible or invisible system?” she asks. And how would you map out the deployment of the antibody test itself? Who, after essential health care workers and the especially vulnerable, would have first crack at them? How long would it take to roll something like this out? There’s no quick way to test nearly 40 million people, and when that test determines freedom of movement, the stakes are enormous. “We already know that there are all kinds of discrimination built into many of our public systems,” Baylis says. (Recall that, in March, the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets was checked for coronavirus as symptomatic New Yorkers clamoured for testing.) “So the idea that it won’t be the wealthy, the powerful, and the elite getting access to serological tests—that’s just not the case.” And yet, a return to some form of life is already underway. Since immunity certificates and at-home antibody tests can’t structure that return, what should? The answer is a three-part strategy that will shape much of our short- and medium-term future: test, track, isolate. It demands, for starters, widespread testing—far more widespread than we have right now. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said that, before any restrictions could be loosened, provinces and territories would need to be running 60,000 pcr tests a day, more than twice as many as they were able to in early May. It is not possible to fight this pandemic without testing both those who are already ill and the so-called silent spreaders, who can transmit the virus before symptoms kick in. It looks increasingly like there are a lot of them out there. After testing 6 percent of Iceland’s population—both those who felt sick and those who felt fine—researchers found that 43 percent of the people who tested positive were asymptomatic at the time. Testing is the backbone of any country’s response to this pandemic. However, once a person receives a positive diagnosis for sars-CoV-2 and is safely placed in isolation—whether that’s in their own home, separate from other family members, or in a medical facility or designated recovery site—contact tracers must go to work. These trained public health employees feature prominently in the response to any communicable disease because they’re essential to identifying and then breaking chains of transmission; now, that means working with someone infected with covid-19 to pinpoint everyone they were exposed to in the forty-eight hours before the onset of their symptoms. Those contacts are then called by tracers and told they must also isolate at home or monitor for symptoms. It’s time-consuming gumshoe work: in normal circumstances, it takes eight to ten people working for about twelve hours to complete one case, says Richelle Schindler of Alberta Health Services. (When robust physical distancing measures are in place, she says, one investigator can wrap up an average case in about nine hours.) Unsurprisingly, many people in the tech industry are eager to disrupt this labour-intensive work and have offered new ways to expedite the process. Digital contact-tracing harnesses Bluetooth-equipped smartphones to detect when two people have been in close proximity. Once a person tests positive for sars-CoV-2, they report their diagnosis to a purpose-built app, which notifies close contacts through that same app, prompting them to isolate or get tested. In April, Google and Apple announced a rare collaboration to produce an opt-in contact-tracing platform that would work on their respective Android and iOS phones—without tracking user locations or necessitating any identifying data. Other countries are test-driving their own approaches to digital tracing. When someone in South Korea tests positive, for example, health authorities issue regional text messages, alerting residents to a website that omits the person’s name but does include details about their age range, gender, and the various places they’ve recently visited. New Zealand is reportedly considering passing out “Covid Cards,” a system that swaps a smartphone for something the size of a credit card, with Bluetooth capability and a battery life of roughly a year. In Quebec, deep-learning pioneer Yoshua Bengio proposed an app that would calculate your covid-19 risk score depending on where you’ve been and who you’ve encountered. Some provinces, including Alberta, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, have launched or are close to launching their own voluntary contact-tracing apps. But these digital tools raise serious questions about abuses of power, says Sean McDonald, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. “Often, in the tech community, there’s the idea that responsibility ends at the product, not at the impact. I think people are asking themselves, ‘Did I produce good location data?’ and not, ‘Am I shouting fire in a movie theatre with no exits?’” Can it be possible for these apps to link back to an individual’s identity? Will they be marshalled for discrimination? Is there a risk of what the American Civil Liberties Union called “surveillance creep” once the pandemic has passed? “If you’re inventing it now,” McDonald says, “chances are it’s not ready.” Even setting those questions aside, contact-tracing apps run the very real risk of simply being ineffective. Unlike human contact tracers, apps don’t seem to be able to distinguish between two strangers who are in so-called contact as they pass each other in a park and two family members living in the same house. They also don’t appear to distinguish between open and closed space: since Bluetooth signals can sometimes pass through walls, the apps will not know if people have been separated by car doors or are in entirely different apartments. In Israel, an app used by the security agency Shin Bet sent a woman into quarantine after it flagged contact with her infected partner. She had been waving at him from outside the building. To achieve what they promise, contact-tracing apps also need considerable uptake among prospective users: researchers at Stanford and the University of Waterloo estimated that 50 to 70 percent of a population would have to sign up. That’s a problem when half the world doesn’t own a smartphone. In countries where their use is pervasive, researchers at the University of Oxford found that 80 percent of smartphone owners would need to install the app before it could be effective. Technology isn’t anathema to human contact tracers: they draw on texts, location history, digital calendars, and transaction records to find the people who’ve entered an infected person’s orbit. “But technology doesn’t replace that clinical judgment of how close is too close, how long did people actually spend together, and what constitutes the onset of a symptom,” says Schindler, who, in the first month of the pandemic, hired roughly 400 medical students, residents, and recently retired health care providers to help Alberta Health Services with this work. Human tracers don’t need to capture every contact an infected person has had in order to be effective, she adds. The government of Ontario, for example, says it must reach about 90 percent of new covid-19 contacts within twenty-four hours as part of its plan to reopen the economy. It’s hard to pin an exact number on how many contact tracers we need: California, which has a similar population to Canada, plans to hire and train 10,000 tracers to do the job, though much depends on how well we’ve observed physical-distancing measures. But, as those measures relax and as more asymptomatic people are able to be tested and diagnosed, contact tracers will continue to be essential to containing community spread. The federal government launched a national recruitment campaign in early April to help with case tracking. By the time applications closed a few weeks later, the cbc reported, nearly 58,000 people had offered to take part. As ron klain, former president Barack Obama’s Ebola czar, has said, the virus is more patient than people are. Places like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, heralded in March as models for containment, had to contend a month later with a new wave of cases, leading to stricter physical-distancing measures and additional shutdowns. The mass quarantine in Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected, was only relaxed after seventy-six days—and even then, the more modest lockdown that followed looked a lot like Canada’s initial approach, with sweeping residential restrictions, school closures, and restaurants open for deliveries only. The process of reopening will, by necessity, continue to be painstaking and slow. The challenge for policy makers and politicians is that, because we shut a bunch of things down at once, it’s hard to know which measures have worked best and which ones can be walked back. “We’re flying blind right now,” says Fabian Lange, a professor of economics at McGill University. “There are lots and lots of variables that we have very little idea about, both epidemiologically and in terms of the economy.” Each province has undertaken its own risk-benefit approach to relaxing some of the physical-distancing measures in a targeted way. “It seems like younger individuals are not getting into as much medical trouble, even if they’ve been exposed,” says epidemiologist John McLaughlin, who retired last year as the chief science officer for Public Health Ontario. That notion informed Quebec premier François Legault’s push to reopen smaller daycares and elementary schools in the middle of May, even over the objections of parents. New Brunswick, which had called off its school year completely more than a month earlier, allowed two households to form a shared bubble, permitting some social interaction while minimizing the risk of spreading the disease. Manitoba kept its schools closed but let hair salons, restaurant patios, and museums reopen at reduced capacity, while Ontario sent seasonal businesses like garden centres to the front of the line. Ontario’s road map for recovery also said sectors could reopen if they modified operations to meet public health requirements. Though, as University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business professor Harish Krishnan notes, if everyone pegs plexiglass sneeze guards as a great way to separate customers at a restaurant, “we’re going to see a bottleneck of plexiglass in the global supply chain emerge very quickly.” Every change made to the interventions requires being incredibly responsive to the first sign of danger: greater numbers of still-susceptible people out in the world result in rising covid-19 cases. When Quebec announced it would reopen schools, the province’s director of public health, Horacio Arruda, promised to change course if hospitals became too crowded or too many people died. Ontario likewise insists a surge in cases will result in tightened measures, as do Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Upshur compares easing restrictions to sparks shooting off a campfire: “As soon as one of those sparks gets loose onto a pine needle lying around, it’s tinder for another fire.” Ease too many measures too quickly and the tinder ignites—and we’re back to contending with an out-of-control pandemic. That’s why epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite and her colleagues at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health proposed a strategy they call dynamic physical distancing, which turns the potential for freshly tightened measures into part of the actual long-term plan. “You look at what’s happening in your icus and, based on their capacity, you then dial your interventions up and down,” she explains. They chose icu capacity because it is, right now, a barometer Canada has a good sense of; with more consistent and comprehensive testing, that barometer could instead be the virus’s reproduction number, which is the average number of new cases one infected person generates. Either way, the approach is the same: as long as the virus can be managed, distancing measures can be eased, but the moment that new cases begin to reapproach that threshold, stricter interventions are turned back on. “Cases go up a bit, we react, they go down, up and down,” Tuite says. It’s another kind of shape we might soon get to know well. Instead of the curve—one line that rises, flattens, and eventually declines—this model looks more like an ocean wave, rising and falling as we toggle between bouts of distancing that respond to new outbreaks. In Tuite’s models, flattening the curve so it stays at a level that does not overwhelm our health care system requires at least a year of physical-distancing vigilance. “I definitely think there is going to be fatigue in terms of twelve to eighteen months of complete shutdown,” she says. On the other hand, dynamic physical distancing—call it riding the wave—“allows us to come up for air once in a while, and that’s important.” A week after Tuite’s study was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, a Harvard study in Science magazine proposed similarly intermittent phases of distancing directed by the prevalence of outbreaks and the capacity of health care systems in their respective communities. The idea is now guiding our national approach: in a joint statement with the premiers, Justin Trudeau said that public health measures should be flexible and proportionate, relaxed and possibly reintroduced based on the level of threat. That could also help ease apprehensive citizens back into the world, since an Angus Reid poll found that only 11 percent of Canadians say they’d resume their former routines as soon as restrictions lifted. Everyone else would wait and see. Okay, then: How long would we need to ride this wave? “We ran this model for two years under the hopefully-not-overly-optimistic idea that, in two years, we’ll have a vaccine,” Tuite says. The Harvard researchers reached that same conclusion: to avoid exceeding critical-care capacity, intermittent physical-distancing measures would be required until 2022. Upshur worries that developing a safe, effective vaccine in eighteen or twenty-four months “would be breaking land-speed records.” McLaughlin is more optimistic. “Compared to any other public health challenge in the past, the vaccine will come fairly soon, I believe,” he says. “It’s fascinating to see what happens when nations and disciplines of science work together.” In late April, the World Health Organization convened heads of government, global health experts, and philanthropists in a pledge to work together on the development and production of tests, treatments, and a vaccine; in early May, Trudeau and other world leaders promised to raise nearly $12 billion for the cause. “We could get clinical trials starting in six months, maybe sooner,” McLaughlin says, “and, if there’s evidence of safety and efficacy within a year, that’s fantastic. That is a tremendous accomplishment.” But we need to accept that we aren’t anywhere near the end of this pandemic. Until the vaccine arrives, and unless sars-CoV-2 mutates into a more benign virus, we must make these small, careful adjustments as we emerge tentatively from our lockdown and settle into the next phase. And that reality brings with it the distinct possibility that we’ll engage in some version of physical distancing again, and again, then again. “The virus doesn’t care about our dreams and aspirations,” Upshur says. “You can’t reason with a virus to go away.” So, for now—and maybe for next year too—we should take our cues from the virus itself. We’re going to have to be patient. Danielle Groen Danielle Groen (@daniellegroen) is a Toronto-based writer who won the 2018 Allan Slaight Prize for Journalism.

In February, the forty-one-year-old returned to Earth after living aboard the International Space Station for almost a year and working a strenuous schedule that involved hundreds of science experiments and six spacewalks. (Koch was lucky: spacewalks are rare, and only some astronauts get to go outside during their missions.) Astronauts often struggle with even the most routine physical activities, including walking, after experiencing the weightlessness of space. Some have returned from much shorter sojourns than Koch’s feeling so physically weak they collapsed during press conferences. Some have also struggled to ease back into everyday life after the thrill of a space mission. To improve the transition, every astronaut follows a tailored rehabilitation program when they return; in Koch’s case, that probably involved sixty days of training—split between nasa’s Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and her home—to readjust to Earth’s gravity. The beach wouldn’t mark the end of Koch’s training, but her coach knew that it would offer a mental health boost and that the astronaut’s desire to see the water again would get her through the first few days of exercises. A week after landing, Koch tweeted a picture of herself standing on a beach, arms outstretched in triumph. In many ways, space can be just as hard on the mind as it is on the body. For astronauts, the isolation, the confinement, and, at times, the uncertainty of space travel can be crushing even though they often spend years preparing for their missions. And, as researchers continue to establish mental health supports for spacebound crews and study travellers who have returned, they’re finding that there’s still much to learn about the long-term psychological effects of these journeys. Can the New Space Race Save Small Towns? The Science of Loneliness How Canadian Scientists Are Leading the Hunt for Extraterrestrial Life Koch had been preparing for her return to Earth while still in space. She told reporters she experienced no serious mental health issues during the mission, in part due to a personal commitment to “always focusing on what I had and not the things I didn’t have.” She also had regular check-ins with a psychologist. Over the past several decades, space programs have gotten better at recognizing the role of astronauts’ mental health in the success of their missions, this after at least a handful of trips were almost derailed due to concerns related to mental health. In 1968, the Apollo 7 crew experienced such uncomfortable conditions, including dealing with bad colds onboard, that they dismissed requests from ground control and even refused to wear helmets during the dangerous phase of reentering Earth’s atmosphere; the astronauts were not allowed to fly again. In 1973, the Skylab 4 crew, which spent eighty-four days in space, took a day off from in-flight research in the face of unrealistic deadlines and against the wishes of mission control; some went so far as to call this behaviour a “mutiny.” And American astronauts, such as Jerry Linenger, complained of isolation due to cultural disconnection while working on the Russian-run Mir space station in the 1990s—Linenger spoke little Russian, and his cosmonaut colleagues didn’t speak English. As nasa and the Russian space agency continued to work together, they included more language and cultural training for crew members. Some astronauts experienced breakdowns after coming back to Earth. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin fell into alcoholism and depression shortly after returning from his 1969 moon landing. To program directors, it became clear that some astronauts might feel a sense of emptiness after completing something as monumental as a space mission. “There was no possible way of setting a goal that would match the goals already achieved,” Aldrin wrote of his depression in his memoir, Return to Earth. The typical astronaut today tends to be a bit older than Aldrin was at the time of his mission (thirty-nine), and that often means they’ve spent more time preparing. But there’s still a lot we don’t know. While researchers believe that, under certain circumstances, space travel can negatively affect mental health, they can’t say for sure whether astronauts suffer more than ordinary people who’ve never left Earth do. And everything we’ve learned about mental health in space so far applies only to travels close to home—to the International Space Station and to the moon. nasa’s current aim to land astronauts on Mars in the mid-2030s—a voyage that would likely be restricted to a small crew and could take years—raises new questions. Could even the most skilled crews learn to tolerate one another for so long in such cramped quarters, travelling farther from home than any human has ever gone, without losing their minds? Meanwhile, aspects of that experience might feel less distant to the millions back on Earth practising physical distancing, isolating in their homes, or living under strict lockdowns due to the covid-19 pandemic. And, while the circumstances differ significantly—staying home but being able to go on occasional walks, as some of us can, isn’t the same as being on a months-long space mission—there’s no doubt that many of us have become deeply familiar with something astronauts have known for decades: it’s hard to live in a confined space for an extended period of time. Fewer than 600 people have made the journey to space. That’s one of the reasons it’s so hard to get a comprehensive sense of the mental health impacts of space travel on humans. Just a dozen people fly to space annually due to limited room aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that brings most crews to orbit from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. But we can learn from groups on Earth that, like those operating in space, work in isolated and often dangerous conditions, says Lawrence Palinkas, a medical anthropologist at the University of Southern California. Since the 1980s, he’s studied crews in polar environments; many of his subjects have experienced depression, feelings of social isolation, and even a sort of psychological torpor or sleepiness that sets in after a few months of working during the long polar nights or twilights. California-based cultural anthropologist Jack Stuster, who has also studied polar and space crews, shared anecdotes of cold-weather crews using unusual strategies to pass the time. One pair, confined to a two-metre-by-three-metre space for nine months as they waited out winter, eventually began sleeping seventeen hours a day because “there was nothing to do,” Stuster says. In light of such research, Palinkas’s work advocates for “coping strategies” for spacebound crews. Team-building training, for example, “enables them to identify points of tension and conflict and work through conflict resolution strategies,” Palinkas says. (Similarly, relationship therapists say couples in isolation should plan ahead for when things get stressful.) nasa, meanwhile, regularly sends astronauts on mini-expeditions in remote areas on Earth, including under water, to help them learn how to work together in isolated conditions. Canadian astronauts also occasionally accompany university researchers on far-flung geologic field expeditions. Astronauts are closely monitored during training, which can take years. With regular medical and psychological screenings, the long wait should give space agencies enough time to assess psychological problems before flight, says Canadian Space Agency flight surgeon Raffi Kuyumjian, who acts as a physician for Canadian astronauts from the ground. In orbit, astronauts remotely check in with their assigned flight surgeon about once a week and with a psychologist about twice a month. The outcome of those sessions could range from a simple thumbs-up to interventions to improve the astronaut’s well-being, Kuyumjian says. This could mean reducing their workload or giving the astronaut some extra time with family (at a distance, of course). Astronauts also sometimes get surprises, such as care packages in spacecraft deliveries or even a conversation with a celebrity, like the one that Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield had publicly with Star Trek’s William Shatner in 2013. (Usually these conversations are private, but Hadfield, who famously entertained global audiences with guitar playing and a rendition of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” from space, opted to livestream the discussion.) But Palinkas warns that there have not been any systematic studies regarding how well these psychological interventions work. Meanwhile, a study at the University of British Columbia aims to create guidelines to help astronauts get ready for the long trip to Mars. Twelve astronauts have been given questionnaires at various points before and after their space missions, focusing especially on any “space culture” crews develop to promote cohesion. Data collection is expected to wrap up this year. Another stream of research, looking into how being in space affects our cognitive skills, is comparing the health and processing abilities of twin brothers, one in space and one on Earth. Scott Kelly, who spent 340 consecutive days in space, was found to have noticeable drops in cognitive performance compared to his brother Mark, who had also been an astronaut but had retired before the study. In other words, returning from an almost year-long stint in space could potentially affect brain function. Is this unique to Scott Kelly, or is it something astronauts on lengthy missions can expect? With a single test subject, it’s hard to say for sure, and studies comparing the Kelly twins are not yet complete. nasa plans to send about ten more astronauts for lengthy sojourns on the International Space Station in the next five or six years; each of their missions could add to the small but growing body of knowledge about the human brain in space. Mars missions aside, tracking the progress of astronauts may also offer insight into how our minds work back on Earth; we don’t need to go too far to feel isolated, overwhelmed, or homesick. In March, as many of us adapted to the realities of social distancing and life in quarantine, Hadfield posted a YouTube video in which he offers viewers tips on self-isolating—including starting fresh projects and learning new skills. “Take care of your spaceship,” he concludes. “And I wish everybody happy landings.

The Real Property Association of Canada, the industry association for the country’s biggest landlords, soon reported a huge wave of skipped rents. Thirty percent of community strip malls missed their payments in April; for enclosed malls, delinquencies reached 44 percent. About two months into the lockdown, nearly a quarter of members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, owners of small- and medium-size businesses across a number of sectors, told researchers they were worried they’d go out of business. By mid-May, 28 percent of the surveyed members of Restaurants Canada, which represents 30,000 restaurants and food-service operations across the country, either said they were never reopening or predicted they would close unless conditions quickly improved. After rent came due on June 1, nearly half of the members of the Retail Council of Canada reported they had not been able to pay their rent at all; over a quarter of them said that landlords had threatened to either change their locks or formally evict them as tenants. “This is not a situation where we anticipate that 1,000 flowers will bloom in the retail space in the aftermath of COVID-19,” says Karl Littler, senior vice-president of public affairs at the Retail Council of Canada. Why It’s Impossible to Buy a House Do Good Landlords Even Exist? Why Grocery Shopping Is on Its Way Out The pandemic isn’t responsible for all of it. In significant ways, the crisis has simply accelerated preexisting problems and trends. Some shopping centres and strip malls were already on the brink. With online shopping eating away at their margins, brick-and-mortar stores have for years tended to be the weakest sector of the commercial real estate market. But there’s also no doubt that countrywide stay-at-home orders have set off a chain reaction of lost revenue that will be working its way through the Canadian economy for years. Early casualties—downsizing global brands, like Victoria’s Secret; stalwart retailers, like Reitmans, seeking court protection; and shuttered popular restaurants, like Montreal’s Le Maizonneuve—are just a preview of the grim times that lie ahead for the retail market. An interesting facet of commercial real estate in Canada is that many owners are institutional as opposed to private. These landlords not only take the form of public real estate companies and real estate investment trusts, or REITs—which allow anyone to invest in real estate like they would in stock—but also fund managers and life insurance companies. Among the biggest institutional owners are pension funds, which collect rent from thousands of businesses in multiple regions of the country, directing the proceeds into investments for teachers and other public-sector employees. The decisions they make, in other words, can affect the retirement plans of middle-income Canadians for decades to come. It’s one more reason institutional landlords can be obsessed with stability and are hungry for data that allows for long-term projections. For years, those projections had been sunny. Now, COVID-19 threatens to make a joke of them. Some tenants, closed by government decree, are looking for rent relief, warning that they could go out of business and thus endanger the very stability institutional landlords depend on. Landlords have been weighing their options. In some cases, they’re worried about paying their own mortgages. In others, they’re worried about failing to deliver expected returns to investors. The sometimes delayed, sometimes aggressive messaging has caused many small-business owners to freak out. “We’ve seen cases of demands for full rent even with businesses with zero revenue,” says Laura Jones, executive vice-president and chief strategic officer of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. “The stress in those cases is through the stratosphere.” The landlord–tenant relationship can be prone to tension and mutual suspicion. A landlord might view tenant complaints as bad-faith efforts to bargain down the rent during the next lease negotiation. By and large, Jones says, landlords appreciate the gravity of the situation and are trying to be accommodating. But she has been surprised, at times, by the lack of empathy toward tenants. “There seems to be a coldness,” she says. The vilification of landlords doesn’t sit well with Shawn Hamilton, senior vice-president and managing director with CBRE Ottawa, an office of the international real estate services company. “The landlord has been made out to be the heavy in all this,” he says, “but if you take it to its extreme”—referring to tenants’ inability to pay rent—“it could cause an entire recalibration of various pension systems and impact people’s ability to retire.” The federal government’s Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program was meant to make it easier for landlords to grant rent relief; instead, it’s upped the acrimony. The deal sounds good: the feds would pay 50 percent of commercial rents on behalf of tenants who saw sales drop by 70 percent or more during the lockdown months. The tenant pays just 25 percent of rent, and the landlord provides a 25 percent discount, taking 75 percent of what they were owed. But some landlords immediately said they weren’t participating. In an April 29 bulletin, since revised, the law firm Gowling WLG recommended that “landlords not agree to rent relief that they would not be prepared to grant without financial assistance from the government.” “It’s not that landlords don’t want to participate,” says Hamilton. “Given rules and contracts landlords have with lenders, they may be forbidden by their mortgage document to provide rent relief.” Commercial rental agreements are much less regulated and much more customized than residential leases, making them harder to amend. Since some landlords have thousands of tenants—some of whom paid all their rent during the lockdown, some of whom paid none—it’s a daunting task to investigate whether each of them is struggling. And, if they’re disqualified, who’s left holding the bag? Allowing a government initiative into an already unprecedented situation makes landlords nervous, and some would prefer to deal with it on their own terms. “If a tenant is negotiating with the landlord in good faith, generally they’ll get a good response,” says John Duda, president of real estate management services in Canada for Colliers International, a global real estate services company. “If the tenant refuses to share any data to show they’re under duress, then I can almost guarantee that negotiation is going to shut down.” Even as elected officials berate landlords to be more generous, Nova Scotia, Alberta, BC, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Quebec have implemented or are in the process of implementing eviction bans to protect commercial tenants during the crisis. There are suspicions that some landlords may use the pandemic lockdown as an opportunity to rid themselves of problematic tenants or businesses they perceive as paying too little for their space. Suspicions also run in the opposite direction, particularly toward large, well-established corporate tenants who claim to be struggling. “Within thirty days of shutting down, they can’t pay the rent?” wonders John Andrew, a professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at Queen’s University and director of executive seminars on corporate and investment real estate. “You have to take [some of what tenants] are saying with a grain of salt.” But the crisis, in some cases, may be beyond the reach of negotiations. The culling of precarious restaurants and stores may end up looking like a blip compared to what the COVID-19 pandemic could do to the office real estate sector. Pre-pandemic, many Canadian companies were skeptical of the idea of employees working from home. The lockdown forced them to go all in—and, for some, it’s working out. Shopify, which has more than 5,000 employees in Canada, has announced its shift to a permanent work-from-home model. In the aftermath of the pandemic, “we could see a reduction of maybe 30 to 40 percent of people working downtown on any given day,” says David Scofield, a professor at Ryerson University’s Ted Rogers School of Management. Fewer office workers would mean fewer people in downtown cores, which would be a further hit on downtown shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Over the long term, remote workers might be inclined to live in cheaper, farther-flung neighbourhoods and spend their leisure time closer to home. The downtown development boom that’s been reinventing Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver might have finally met its match. “Why do I need to live downtown if I’m working from home anyway?” asks Scofield. Suburban sprawl, long a derogatory term, could seem like common sense. Of course, it’s also possible that that scenario might not occur. Here’s some of the math landlords and tenants are currently doing: a typical office-space client these days rents about 130 square feet per employee. At close to $40 per square foot for Class A—or highest-quality—office space in Toronto, that’s $5,200 in net rent per employee per year. Have 100 employees work from home, and that’s more than a half million in annual savings. But what if social distancing becomes a long-term strategy against COVID-19 and other contagious diseases? Giving each remaining office worker six feet of distancing might mean that office footprints should remain the same. Maybe. “We’re cautioning [our clients] against making forever decisions right now,” says Hamilton. “It’s like making a decision to never drink again after the office Christmas party.” Persnickety landlords want answers to these questions about the future in order to figure out what to do about their currently floundering tenants. If things return to normal quickly, and if new businesses spring up from the ashes of the fallen, then playing the heavy makes more sense. If COVID-19 transforms the market for decades, then tolerating a few months of losses from existing tenants might seem more reasonable considering how many tenants—and possible future tenants—might vanish. “From our perspective, it’s not going to be a landlord’s market, even as some mule-headedly push their tenants into unsustainable positions,” says Littler. “Landlords need to be thinking in flinty-eyed economic self-interest.” Which is to say: short-term pain for long-term gain. A tenant who can’t pay 100 percent of the rent is better than no tenant at all. It may not be all bad for consumers, especially those who feel guilty shopping for deals from US retail giants like Amazon. The lockdown has forced many small- and medium-size Canadian businesses to do what some may have been putting off for years: sell online. It’s no surprise that Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify became the country’s most valuable public company in the middle of the economic shutdown. Consumers under lockdown have had no choice but to shop online; many of them have discovered they like it and will make a habit of it. Shopify’s gain will be main street’s loss. In fact, the big winner, so far, is the industrial real estate market, which is seeing increased demand for online-shopping distribution centres. Decisions that will dramatically affect Canada’s economy have to be made right now, tenant by tenant, despite a dearth of information about what will happen next week, never mind next month. If bankruptcies continue, communities may lose the stores and restaurants that make them great places to live. And landlords may find themselves stuck with shuttered shopping malls that nobody wants to buy.

According to the most recent numbers, the deficit for the 2020/21 fiscal year could reach $343 billion—a figure nearly seven times as large as the deficit Canada racked up during the 2008/09 financial crisis. We are likely heading toward the largest deficit since the Second World War. Never miss stories like this one. Sign up for our Sunday night newsletter: By checking this box I consent to receiving emails from The Walrus. Submit The money is being spent on everything from direct supports for Canadians, like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and Canada Emergency Wage Supplement (CEWS), to transfers for provinces and municipalities, which help them manage the sudden shortfalls in their own revenues. And, while it’s all in the service of preventing Canada’s economy from flatlining from the devastating fallout of a global pandemic, it has some people wondering if the treatment is worse than the disease. The economic snapshot released by the federal government in July described the unprecedented deficit as the “challenge of our lifetime” while, in an August tweet, Conservative senator Leo Housakos accused the prime minister of leading “the greatest country in the world into bankruptcy.” But what if we didn’t have to raise taxes or cut spending to reduce our COVID-19 debt? What if the Bank of Canada could pay it all down simply by printing more money? That’s the basic tenet behind modern monetary theory (MMT), an economic idea that has found new popularity in recent months. MMT proposes that countries that issue their own currency, like Canada and the United States, can’t go broke the way a household or business can and therefore don’t need to worry quite as much about running up debt. Leading this resurgence in MMT is Stephanie Kelton, a former economic adviser to Bernie Sanders and the author of The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People’s Economy. In the book, she argues that the prevailing narrative about government finances is informed by a false sense of scarcity when it comes to budgeting, and that abandoning this belief could open up a range of possibilities for progressive legislation aimed at saving the planet, improving living standards and education, and creating sustainable infrastructure—programs for which governments always claim to not have enough money. “What if I showed you that the deficit bogeyman isn’t real?” Kelton writes. “What if I could convince you that we can have an economy that puts people and planet first? That finding the money to do this is not the problem?” This is heresy among more conventional economists, never mind the politicians and pundits who pride themselves on fiscal discipline. After all, we’ve been told for decades that government deficits and debt lead to a weaker currency, more inflation, and ultimately financial ruin. We’ve also been told that there are basically two policy responses to debt and deficit: tax increases or spending cuts. But, after watching governments and central banks throw trillions of dollars at the COVID-19-driven economic crisis only to have inflation disappear and interest rates drop to zero, that consensus may be cracking. “There is a big rethink happening on this, even in the mainstream community,” says Marc-Andre Pigeon, an assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy and a long-standing MMT proponent. As Pigeon argued in a policy brief, this rethink could fundamentally alter the way we understand the defining challenges of a postpandemic world. Rather than worrying about balancing the budget or paying down debt, governments could be empowered to invest in ways that address the social and environmental deficits we’ve been racking up for decades. If we keep that in mind, Pigeon writes, we might find ourselves “discarding the fiscal scolds just as Copernicus discounted those who insisted on the increasingly convoluted Ptolemaic model that put the earth at its centre.” Don’t Worry about the Federal Deficit How Universal Basic Income Will Save the Economy I’m Part of the 0.1 Percent and I Want a Wealth Tax Modern monetary theory traces its origins to the early twentieth century, when a German economist named Georg Friedrich Knapp theorized that the intrinsic value of a currency wasn’t a function of its relationship to a commodity, like gold, but came from people’s faith in the government that backstopped that currency. In other words, economies could print as much money as they needed; they weren’t constrained by the size of their gold reserves. Knapp’s theory was augmented in the 1940s by Russian-born economist Abba Lerner, who suggested that, because deficits could coexist easily with low inflation—and because printing money to pay for the former didn’t have to raise the latter—government spending could be as ambitious as it needed to be. But Lerner’s ideas, already unconventional at the time, became radioactive by the 1970s, when a nasty bout of stagflation (that is, the combination of rising inflation and rising unemployment) hit the Western world. MMT, however, wasn’t dead—just resting. For decades, the theory was discussed and debated only within the confines of academia. That is, until Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider, in January 2019, that MMT “absolutely” needed to be “a larger part of our conversation.” Suddenly, it seemed like everyone with even a passing interest in economic theory was talking about the idea, either warming to its possibilities or recoiling from its implications. As the Economist noted last July, “A profound shift is now taking place in economics as a result, of the sort that happens only once in a generation.” Not surprisingly, MMT has its share of detractors. “The idea that deficits don’t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong,” said Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. In 2019, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett suggested that, if a government relied on its central bank to buy its debt, this could reduce demand for its currency, undermine the value of that currency, and eventually risk “spiralling” inflation, which when left unchecked can burn through an economy like wildfire. His long-time business partner Charlie Munger went even further, telling a CNBC reporter, “I am so afraid of a democracy getting the idea that you can just print money to solve all problems. Eventually, I know, that will fail. ‘You don’t have to raise taxes, you just print.’ In the end, if you end up printing too much, you end up like Venezuela.” Munger was referring to the way inflation had ravaged the once-strong Venezuelan economy over the last decade, driving millions into poverty and starvation. MMTers like Pigeon and Stephanie Kelton readily acknowledge both the risks of inflation and the need to contain it. But the notion that a stable democracy like Canada could quickly devolve into a failed kleptocracy like Venezuela ignores that the Canadian government actually has a number of preemptive tools at its disposal, from tax increases to more stringent regulations on lending and finance, that would control the amount of money flowing through the economy and avoid sparking episodes of runaway inflation. There’s also the fact that the conventional understanding of the relationship between deficits and inflation can’t explain Japan, where enormously high debt-to-GDP levels (it surpassed 200 percent in 2019; in Canada, debt was approximately 31 percent of GDP that year) have coexisted with a strong currency and ultralow interest rates for decades. According to some traditional economists, this shouldn’t be possible—those deficits and that debt should have pushed down demand for the yen, which in turn would have made Japan’s imports more expensive, thus fuelling inflation and triggering a jump in the interest rate to snuff it out. But inflation in Japan has remained relentlessly and remarkably muted, and its currency trades at the same valuations as it did back in the 1990s. We have our own examples of debt and deficits not leading to economic ruin here in North America. In 2008/09, central banks pumped trillions of dollars into global credit markets in an effort to avert total economic collapse. Despite dire warnings about the imminent threat of inflation, it never actually materialized. Interest rates remained low, the US dollar remained strong, and inflation remained conspicuously muted. Nevertheless, those warnings have returned as governments backed up their proverbial trucks in an effort to prevent another economic collapse in the face of COVID-19, and they will almost certainly continue to shape the conversation around what we do after the virus passes. But MMT offers an intriguing alternative to the fiscal austerity that Canada turned to in the 1990s and 2000s in order to start cutting into the national debt. And, according to Pigeon, this country is well-positioned to serve as an incubator for these new ideas. Not simply because we issue our own currency but because the Bank of Canada enjoys a rare level of freedom. “I think Canada’s probably been a better case study for the MMT propositions than the United States,” he says, “in the sense that, operationally, there’s very few restrictions around what the Bank of Canada can do versus what the Federal Reserve can do.” This isn’t just a matter for fiscal-policy wonks. Embracing MMT and investing in ways to address our social and environmental deficits could help policy makers close the gap between rich and poor, heal some of the fissures in society, and avoid the kind of populist flashpoints that Pigeon believes has led to situations like Brexit and the Trump presidency. As working people have fallen ever further behind those with capital and wealth, they’ve increasingly turned to political leaders who promise easy solutions. In that light, inflation might be the least of Canada’s problems. “There are worse outcomes,” Pigeon says, “and I think we’ve lived a lot of that in the last thirty or forty years.” Indeed, as a trio of pro-MMT economists argued in a 2019 Financial Times piece, “Commenters are not wrong that some of these proposals and tools will be controversial. What is ignored by this criticism is the fact that our current approach of managing inflation on the backs of a very indebted and underemployed public is also controversial.” Time will tell whether we can get past the language of belt-tightening and boot-strapping to have a more creative conversation about the role and purpose of government spending. But one thing is already clear: governments can spend far more during an emergency than we ever thought possible. The real question is how we’ll define what qualifies as an emergency—and how willing we’ll be to respond to it.

Thousands of Nicotiana benthamiana plants, a close cousin of tobacco, grow in long rows amid noisy ventilation. When the plants are six or seven weeks old, maybe twenty centimetres tall, they go on a journey, lined up by the dozens onto a flatbed that’s then inverted over a tank filled with fluid. The plants get dunked. The tank seals. And the roots are trapped in the air between the liquid and the lid, so a vacuum hose can slip into that space and begin to suck. The plants act like sponges: apply pressure to the roots and the leaves collapse; release that pressure a minute later and they expand, absorbing the liquid deep into their cells. This particular bath is filled with a bacteria that’s been slightly tweaked. Bits of its DNA have been swapped out for DNA from the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Pandemic Is Intensifying the Opioid Crisis How to Lift a Lockdown Your Brain on COVID-19 Once the plants come out of the tank, they’re moved to an incubation chamber, the temperature, light, and humidity tightly controlled. For the next week or so, the bacteria will insert its genetic information into the plants, triggering the production of millions of spike proteins in every cell of the infected leaves. The spikes self-assemble into something called a virus-like particle—not the virus itself but a particle roughly the size and shape of SARS-CoV-2. Gowned workers come and harvest the plants, stripping the leaves like they’re plucking basil for pesto, then send them on a conveyor belt that passes through what’s basically a paper shredder. The chopped-up leaves head next into a vat of enzymes and are left to soak overnight. The enzymes work to break apart the cell walls, releasing the viruslike particles so they can be collected, purified, and converted into a yellowish vaccine. This doppelgänger for SARS-CoV-2 can’t inflict any real damage, but “when you inject it into someone, the immune system sees it as though it’s the real virus and thinks, Oh my God, there’s an invader here,” says Medicago executive Nathalie Landry. “And then it will trigger a good immune response.” A vaccine is, in essence, a trick—a sleight of hand that convinces your body to mount a counterattack to a given pathogen before that pathogen actually infects you. There are various ways to pull the trick off: vaccines can be made with a weakened virus, or a killed virus, or just a key part of the virus, or a part of the virus piggybacking on a different, benign virus, or an instruction manual for making that part of the virus yourself. In each approach, you get the benefits of an immune response without the messy business of a disease. It’s a crucial tool for combatting a virus impervious to borders, seasonality, and many of the lockdown measures employed by anxious nations. So, when US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci tells Congress, as he did in July, that he’s optimistic a vaccine will be ready in late 2020 or early 2021, it’s tempting to imagine that as the moment when we can once again engage in all the activities that remain laced with fear, like hopping a plane, or seeing a concert, or hugging a grandpa. An effective vaccine represents an enormous, exciting move in that direction. But it’s not the pandemic finish line—it’s more like a pandemic off-ramp. Epidemiological, logistical, and ethical roads still lie ahead: to determine how long and how well that vaccine’s protection can last, to manufacture enough of it to jab into billions of arms, to allocate the first batches of supply between countries and within their populations, and to persuade vaccine skeptics to roll up a sleeve. We’re trying to protect the entire planet, all 7.8 billion of us. “The job isn’t done when you’ve got an effective vaccination,” says Ross Upshur, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health who cochairs the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 ethics working group. “The job is done when you get that vaccine out to everyone who needs it.” Humans have been trying to outsmart viruses for millennia. By the late 1600s, Chinese doctors had formalized their recipe: grind a smallpox scab into a powder and blow it up a healthy patient’s nose. (Apparently, for boys, this was done in the left nostril, and for girls, the right.) An ambassador to Britain sent reports of seventeenth-century North African surgeons making a small incision between the thumb and forefinger, then squeezing smallpox pus into the wound. At the turn of the nineteenth century, Edward Jenner extracted fluid from a cowpox blister, taken from—who else?—a milkmaid, and scratched it into the arm of an eight-year-old boy. These efforts may seem crude now—we prefer our vaccines packed tidily in glass vials, injected though sterile hypodermic needles—but the idea remains the same: teach the immune system how to ward off a virus so it has a head start should infection occur. A vaccine is, in essence, a trick—a sleight of hand that convinces your body to mount a counterattack to a given pathogen before that pathogen actually infects you When a new pathogen invades the human body, our innate immune system recognizes the presence of something noxious and sends up an alarm. The first responders are proteins that meddle with a virus in order to limit its ability to reproduce. “This is what’s called the dumb part of the immune system, though that’s quite mean because it’s not dumb at all,” says Brian Ward, an infectious-disease professor at McGill University and the medical officer for Medicago. But it’s also not precise: the innate immune system attacks anything that appears foreign and troublesome. Cue the adaptive immune system. “When cells are infected with a pathogen, they gobble it up, break it into pieces, and then start showing those pieces to the cells, saying, Hey, I found something that doesn’t belong here, can you please get rid of it?” says Marc-André Langlois, a molecular virologist at the University of Ottawa. B cells (a type of white blood cell) begin making antibodies: proteins that can subdue a virus by blocking its ability to get into the body’s cells. T cells (another type of white blood cell) arrive with two purposes: to help B cells make more antibodies and to assassinate cells that have been infected by the virus. It’s a more sophisticated response, but it’s also slower, taking a week, sometimes longer, to mobilize. “So, if you have a rapidly replicating virus, and it doubles, doubles, doubles, waiting seven days for antibodies might be too long and you might not survive,” Langlois says. If the infection is cleared, many of the body’s B and T cells then die off themselves. Some, though, transform into memory cells, typically bunkered down in your bone marrow, where they wait to spring into action the next time that same pathogen attacks. “All it takes is one B cell to recognize the target and get activated, and it will start proliferating so it can produce the antibodies,” Langlois says. “That’s why vaccines work. They give you this life-saving element of having the antibodies ready to be deployed.” A defence that would otherwise take the body weeks to mount can be summoned in just a few hours. We’ve come a long way from smallpox pus, but to develop a vaccine, scientists still need to pick their poison. In modern medicine, that decision involves choosing whether to use the entire virus or just a vital part of it. Whole-virus vaccines are the traditional approach. One strategy, dating back to the 1930s, is to take the pathogen—grown in giant batches of chicken eggs or, decades later, in cells—and then kill it, usually with heat, chemicals, or radiation. Because the virus is dead, it doesn’t cause disease once introduced to the body, even in people with weakened immune systems; because the virus is dead, it also doesn’t always cause a strong immune response, often requiring multiple doses. This approach is used in the flu shot and a hepatitis A vaccine, as well as in the one for polio, which a global vaccination effort has essentially wiped out. In a more recent variation on the whole-virus vaccine, a pathogen is weakened in a lab rather than killed outright. Chances are you’ve been jabbed with a bunch of these vaccines: they’re how we fight measles, chicken pox, yellow fever, and tuberculosis. Here, the cost-benefit analysis is reversed: because the vaccine closely resembles a natural infection, it typically elicits a robust, enduring response; because the vaccine is more potent, though, people with compromised immune systems are often unable to get it at all. But, by using the entire virus, the vaccine builds an immune response to many different parts of the pathogen. “The whole-virus vaccine is like a big shield in front of you,” Ward says. “If you’re in a Star Wars movie and someone is shooting lasers at you, you’re much safer behind that shield.” Yet a smaller shield, precisely positioned, can still protect you by blocking an important part of the virus rather than the whole thing. There are several ways of introducing this target protein—which is called the antigen—to the body. Most of them require another ingredient to fortify the shield: an adjuvant, usually aluminum, which for the past ninety years has been added to vaccines to boost the immune response. “An adjuvant is a little like hot sauce,” says Robert Kozak, a microbiologist at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. It livens up what’s already on your plate. One method of delivering the target protein to your body is to deploy a weakened common-cold virus, called an adenovirus, as a microscopic Trojan horse. That cold virus is unlikely to cause much damage, but it’s hugely efficient at slipping inside cells and releasing the antigen. Though scientists see promise in this approach, only one adenovirus vaccine has ever been approved, anywhere. In part, that’s because vaccines tend not to make a ton of money, and it’s wildly expensive to develop a new platform, so funding can be hard to come by. It’s also because adenovirus-vaccine candidates are in human trials for complicated diseases, like HIV and malaria, which are challenging targets. Another method skips the Trojan horse altogether and injects you directly with the pathogen’s critical protein. Virus-like-particle vaccines, such as Medicago’s plant-grown candidate, are a type of these protein-based vaccines. It’s a proven method—HPV and hepatitis B are just two examples—and there are usually few side effects once you’re given the shot. Then there are genetic vaccines, which don’t deliver the antigen itself but instead issue a blueprint of that target protein to our bodies, hijacking our own cells to produce it. In a DNA vaccine, DNA containing the gene for the antigen is delivered to the cells. The cells copy those genetic instructions into molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which issue marching orders to the body to assemble the antigen. “The antigen is then presented to the immune system, [which] mounts a defence,” says Gary Kobinger, one of the scientists behind the Ebola vaccine, who is now working on a DNA candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine for Laval University. It’s a relatively new method of vaccination, though Kobinger points out that, “in the field of experimental vaccines, it’s quite old,” a technology discovered back in the early ’90s. Messenger RNA vaccines bypass the DNA and go straight to the marching orders. The genetic material for the antigen is produced synthetically, then packed inside a pod made of lipid molecules, which slide easily into the cells. The benefits are that there’s no messing around with infectious material and the vaccine’s production time can be cut down dramatically, which is why some researchers believe a genetic vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready first. The disadvantage is that this is uncharted territory: no DNA or mRNA vaccines are currently approved for human use. SARS-CoV-2 is a stealthy operator. It has a gift for binding its spike proteins—those knobby mushrooms that every coronavirus illustration has burned into our brain —to receptors on particular cells scattered in high numbers along the lining of our respiratory tract. When contact is made, it creates an opening through which the virus can pour its genetic code, the RNA, inside our bodies. “The moment the RNA enters the body, it takes [over] the cell—there’s no wasting time,” says Natalia Martin Orozco, vice-president of drug development at Toronto-based Providence Therapeutics, which pivoted from developing an mRNA vaccine for cancer to one for COVID-19. The first proteins that SARS-CoV-2 produces are not to make more copies of itself but instead to suppress an immune response. “It says, Okay, let’s block everything that is going to stop me from multiplying,” Martin Orozco says. “After that, it starts producing what it needs to build the virus and grow.” There are now more than 200 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 in development around the world, using every conceivable approach. The vast majority of them, however, zero in on the spike as the vaccine’s target protein: the University of Oxford, Johnson & Johnson, and CanSino Biologics all insert the spike into weakened common-cold viruses; Novavax’s vaccine attaches the proteins to microscopic particles that are used as carriers; Moderna and Pfizer’s candidates encode the spike into their mRNA. It’s a good bet. The spikes are found in abundance on the surface of the virus, so they’re what our immune system sees first. “With the first SARS, we saw that the virus used the spike protein to enter cells,” says Kozak. “Viruses can be shockingly unoriginal sometimes, so if blocking that protein protected you against SARS One, it will probably work against SARS Two.” Not all of these candidates, in the end, will work—many of them won’t. (A sobering statistic: one 2016 study found that nearly nine out of every ten new drugs fail in the human-testing phase.) And it’s not yet clear what exactly will ward this virus off. “We don’t know the relative importance and contribution of antibodies and T cells in terms of protection against COVID,” says Manish Sadarangani, director of the Vaccine Evaluation Center, in Vancouver. Immunity isn’t an on/off switch: there are multiple levels of protection conferred by either shaking off a disease or receiving its vaccine. Some vaccines, like the one for hepatitis A, provide sterilizing immunity, which prevents the infection and its transmission almost entirely. Others, like those for diphtheria and tetanus, generate neutralizing immunity, where an infection can occur but won’t get very far and can’t make someone sick. Sometimes, as with the shingles vaccine, recipients aren’t fully covered but experience a milder version of the disease. Often, protection isn’t life-long, so we need booster shots to shore up our immunity. When it comes to coronaviruses, immune responses tend to be short-lived: two to three years for the first SARS virus, for example, after which people exposed to that same pathogen would likely fall sick once again. Still, three years of protection sounds pretty good right now. As Martin Orozco says, “Even if the vaccine lasted just one season, that, to me, would be a really great accomplishment.” In the midst of a pandemic, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that performs as well as a flu shot is nothing to sneeze at. Twice a year a consortium of scientists representing more than 100 influenza centres in more than 100 countries descends on the World Health Organization (WHO) to pick the flu strains that should be combatted by seasonal vaccines. For the northern hemisphere, these selections are made in February; for the southern hemisphere, September. Once the recommendations are made, the viruses are produced in WHO laboratories, then shipped to the companies around the world that manufacture the corresponding vaccines. There is no centralized body whipping up batches of SARS-CoV-2 for developers looking to try their hand at a COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, they need the genetic code for the virus, which Chinese researchers sequenced in the second week of January and shared in a public database. Once scientists determined what was inside the 30,000 “letters” of this coronavirus’s RNA, they could decide which proteins to target in their vaccines. After developers pick their antigen and their delivery system, they test it, starting with animals. Because ferrets and hamsters are, like us, naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, they were a popular choice for early vaccine trials at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (vido-InterVac). If the vaccine protects those animals from infection, the next step is a safety trial with dozens of people, to see if fevers spike or injected arms swell, followed by another trial, which measures how well an immune response to the virus has been produced. Then it’s on to the third trial, where thousands of volunteers are monitored for a statistically significant difference between rates of infection in an unvaccinated control group and in people who actually got the jab. At least half a dozen leading candidates have entered phase-three trials, including ones from the University of Oxford, Moderna, and Pfizer. Currently, the WHO has set the minimum bar for an effective vaccine at an infection-reduction rate of 50 percent, though 70 percent is preferred. What’s needed to make enough doses for these trials depends on the type of vaccine. For Medicago’s plantbased candidate, there must be wellstocked greenhouses and a dunking tank. To take another example: at vido-InterVac, where researchers are working on a protein-based vaccine, they begin with a single cell. “We take the gene from the virus that encodes for the spike protein, and we put that gene into the single cell, which now thinks it is its own protein,” says vido-InterVac director and ceo Volker Gerdts. At first, scientists use a three-litre beaker that contains everything necessary to make a cell happy: some sugars, a couple of amino acids, a nice warm environment, and a little CO2, so the cell is fooled into believing it’s still in a body. One cell divides into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen; the three-litre beaker becomes twenty litres, then 250, all the way up to a 1,000- or 2,000-litre bioreactor. From one individual cell, you can make enough of the protein for thousands, even millions of doses. Gerdts’s team wants just that protein in its vaccine, without sugar or waste or any of those extra bits. To isolate the spike, the liquid will get separated in a centrifuge: spun so the heavier waste and cell walls fall to the bottom, leaving the lighter protein on top. It will then get purified, so anything else that lingers is removed. “It gets really cleaned up to the point where you just have a very concentrated, pure substance,” Gerdts says. “And then you put it in a glass vial.” Making a successful vaccine is one challenge. Making enough of it to satisfy world demand is another. There are, of course, all sorts of regulations and standards concerning how to go about production: “I can’t head into my basement and start brewing up a vaccine,” says Curtis Cooper, president of the Canadian Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Every facility needs to conform to Good Manufacturing Practices (gmp), which are exceptionally specific rules set out by the WHO that ensure quality control. You want consistency over time so that each successive batch is precisely the same. Many Canadian labs can produce enough vaccine for their clinical research under these strict gmp conditions. But, when it comes to scaling up production, we’re not in nearly as strong a position. Gerdts says that there are two facilities in Canada with large-scale production capacity: Medicago and the National Research Council, which partnered with CanSino Biologics to produce its vaccine and received a recent $126 million federal boost. At Medicago’s clinical facility in Quebec City, 20 million doses of its plant-based vaccine, if successful, can roll out over a year; there’s a commercial facility in North Carolina that can manufacture another 100 million doses annually for whoever signs a contract. A third facility is slated to be built in Quebec, with greenhouses the size of two football fields, though that won’t be completed until 2023. And, in March, vido-InterVac received $23.3 million from the Canadian government, half of which will be used to complete its own much larger facility, which should be ready by next July. In the meantime, Gerdts is compelled to wait until another manufacturer can begin to produce his candidate. “Canada does not have the manufacturing capacity that is needed for making a vaccine for the world,” he says. “We’re not even close to making enough for Canadians.” What happened? Marc-André Langlois believes that—at least before this very moment—there wasn’t much of an appetite to equip the country for a hypothetical pandemic. “It’s generally unpopular to invest in preparedness, because you have all the other urgent commitments that start creeping up,” he says. “People might not want $300 million spent on making a vaccine-manufacturing facility for another virus that could potentially burn out.” Illustration by Glenn Harvey. It’s also a predictable outcome of operating in a global economy. “We outsource a lot of our vaccine procurement to these big multinationals in Europe, and we have not invested in the production capacity in Canada,” says vido-InterVac’s associate director of business development, Paul Hodgson. Canadian branches of international pharmaceutical companies, like GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur, are capable of producing other vaccines, but “it’s not like they have extra capacity just sitting there to push a new vaccine through,” he says. “It’s a matter of priorities—when there’s an opioid crisis or roads need repairs, where do you put the money? But, if you think research is expensive, you should try disease.” That has sent Canada looking for supplies elsewhere. The federal government has ordered 75 million syringes and needles from medical-technology company Becton Dickinson, enough to inoculate nearly every Canadian twice, and issued bids to secure a similar quantity of alcohol swabs, gauze strips, and bandages. “Our government is working on all possible fronts to deliver safe and effective treatments and vaccines to Canadians as quickly as possible,” procurement minister Anita Anand says. “What this means is, while we are working with domestic suppliers, we are also pursuing international arrangements.” In early August, she announced the first of these arrangements: a pair of deals with American companies Pfizer and Moderna for tens of millions of doses of their respective mRNA vaccines. By month’s end, Canada had also secured 38 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s candidate and 76 million doses of Novavax’s vaccine. Plenty of other countries inked deals of their own this summer: the UK reserved 100 million doses of the University of Oxford’s vaccine while the US secured another 300 million—that’s nearly a quarter of Oxford’s projected annual supply gone. By mid-August, preorders of COVID-19 vaccine candidates were reportedly stretching toward 6 billion doses, almost all of them claimed by wealthy nations. None of these vaccines has yet been proven to work. There’s another risk in relying on international sources: the goods might never show up. Early in the pandemic, for example, the White House ordered medical manufacturing titan 3M to stop exporting N95 face masks to Canada and elsewhere until the US shored up its own supply. The clinical trial for CanSino’s vaccine candidate was meant to start in Halifax this past May. Chinese customs refused to release the shipment; by late summer, the trial had to be called off. Global initiatives do exist to try to level the vaccination playing field. The international immunization nonprofit Gavi is pooling money from dozens of highand middle-income countries to invest in a number of vaccine candidates, including Oxford’s, with the aim of manufacturing 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. That’s meant to be enough for each country to vaccinate 20 percent of its population, with an emphasis on front line workers and vulnerable groups and with the cost fully covered for low-income nations. In June, Canada pledged $120 million to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a global project that includes Gavi’s vaccine-distribution initiative. China and the US haven’t contributed. But every country, company, and initiative will be competing for the same limited supplies; already, there have been murmurings of glass shortages that could curb the availability of vials. Stoppers are made by only a handful of companies. And it doesn’t take much to cause a major bottleneck. “At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn’t have enough nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests,” says Allison McGeer, a senior clinical physician at Toronto’s Sinai Health System. More than 100,000 swabs, ordered by the federal government, arrived in Ontario contaminated by mould. “These are tiny, [cheap] things, but if you don’t have any of them, you’re paralyzed,” she says. “There’s a long list of those things that go into vaccine manufacturing that have a potential to pose the same sort of problems. There only has to be one little grommet missing and the whole system doesn’t work.” Vaccines are designed to prevent infection. You don’t want to cause another infection altogether by putting that vaccine in a grimy vial. Sterilization is extremely important: this is a product moving from the outside world directly into our muscles. “We have to prepare and sterilize the vial, prepare and sterilize the stopper, all the tubing and fill needles, all the parts and pieces that would touch the vaccine,” says Christopher Procyshyn, co-founder of Vancouver-based Vanrx Pharmasystems. “Everything is individually sterilized and then brought together in an aseptic process, which basically means: don’t screw it up.” However it has been made, the vaccine arrives at a facility like Vanrx’s in a bag or a tank, frozen or in liquid form. It’s most often sterilized through microfiltration, which passes the product through a filter with pores smaller in diameter than any known bacteria. The glass vials also arrive and are sterilized: washed with purified water, then blasted with heat. “Glass is a greasy material, so we have to take it to a high enough temperature that we burn it off, much like a self-cleaning oven,” Procyshyn says. The vials go into a filling machine, where they’re sterilized using high-pressure steam, as are the stoppers and caps. In conventional technologies, what happens next “looks a lot like Laverne and Shirley—like a food-processing line,” Procyshyn says. “You have conveyor belts coming in,” and a machine positions a whole bunch of tubes, which, he continues, “squeeze in a pulsation manner and fill the vial with the liquid, the stopper, the cap.” Vanrx automates the process inside a large machine, where the filling is done by a robot. Procyshyn suspects that, given the need to conserve supplies, vaccines for COVID-19 will be packaged in multidose vials, enough to vaccinate twenty patients each. The fastest machines in the industry run around 600 units per minute: for one facility, on a full production day, that translates to somewhere between 15 and 20 million doses. “But don’t forget that other drugs are continuing to be made,” Procyshyn says. “Not all facilities are suitable for this, and Canada has fewer . . . than the US and Europe. A large part of what we’re working through right now is which vaccine at which available site and what capacity.” Now ensconced in its multidose vial, the vaccine is inspected by employees, labelled, and given a lot number, essential for safety tracking. After that, it has to be transported through the cold chain, a standard practice to ensure that, every time the vaccine is handed off, it maintains the appropriate temperature, typically between 2 and 8 degrees for refrigerated vaccines or -15 degrees for frozen ones. That means the moment it leaves the doorstep of the manufacturer, bundled in boxes wrapped in isothermal packaging, the vaccine is kept in chilly containers. The plane that transports it is refrigerated, as is the truck that picks it up from the airport, as is the wholesaler or warehouse in Canada where it’s kept before being moved to health care facilities across the country. “This is a well-established process,” says Mina Tadrous, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto’s Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. “We’ve been doing this for decades and we’re really good at it.” No one needs to rely on the diligence of others: surveillance systems exist to make sure that the cold chain hasn’t been broken. “It used to be that you’d carry in a box of vaccines, and there was a temperature probe inside that provided a continuous recording, so you’d make sure they hadn’t been frozen or gotten too hot,” McGeer says. Then, in 1996, the WHO introduced temperature-sensitive stickers that monitor the heat exposure of individual vaccine vials. “It’s a stellar development: a little colour-coded square that tells you whether it’s been out of temperature,” she says. The square starts lightly tinged; if it gets dark, the vial needs to be discarded. As a result, clinicians can determine whether the whole box has been compromised or just a few vaccine vials fell out of the cold chain. When supply is tight, it helps to have every possible vial on hand. We might be inventing a vaccine from scratch, but we’re not inventing a whole new system to get it into the arms of Canadians. “The best immunization system is almost invisible,” says Natasha Crowcroft, inaugural director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases and now a senior technical adviser at the WHO. “People talk about immunization being the victim of its own success: when everything is going smoothly, no one knows how much work goes on behind the scenes.” In Canada, this work involves a terrific amount of coordination between the federal government, responsible for procuring the vaccine; the provinces and territories, which determine how many doses they’ll need and which ones to deliver to which people; and local jurisdictions, which make on-the-ground decisions about administering it. When it comes to distributing vaccines for COVID-19, Canada will most likely take cues from the influenza-vaccination programs we have in place. For those, Health Canada approves and then bulk orders the vaccines, choosing a couple of different candidates in case there are manufacturing snafus or to target certain segments of the population—seniors tend to get a high-dose flu shot because their immune systems benefit from the added boost. Buying in bulk helps cushion the cost: Moderna, which has said it plans to make a profit from its SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, will lower the price for big orders. The provinces then determine how exactly to get the doses out, allotting a certain share to family doctors, public health clinics, community clinics, and pharmacies. Typically, they’ll also decide whether they will publicly fund vaccination and for whom. Ontario has a universal flu-vaccination program, for example, and BC and Quebec do not, though it’s hard to imagine that anyone will have to shell out for a COVID-19 shot. While flu shots are ordered and distributed based on how many people got one the previous year, planning for COVID-19 vaccines presents its own challenges: we don’t know what the supply is going to be, how well it will work in different populations, or how many doses the vaccine might require. “If they’re anticipating that we’re going to have tons of doses in a short period of time, then it would make sense to have as many vaccinators as possible,” says Jeff Kwong, epidemiologist and interim director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases. You could walk into your family doctor’s office, the local library, the nearest Shoppers Drug Mart or Pharmasave—take your pick. “But, if they’re going to have relatively low numbers of doses available each week, then having a more limited number of vaccinators is more efficient.” You don’t want to run into a situation where one physician has fifty doses sitting idly in a fridge while another scrambles to contend with an out-the-door line. For that reason, vaccines could be administered just in public health clinics. “After the H1N1 pandemic, we really spent a lot of time developing our mass-immunization clinic plan,” says Toronto’s associate medical officer of health, Vinita Dubey. “That was the time to detail some of the boots-on-the-ground logistics.” The plan includes everything from where to hold large vaccination clinics and how to keep them staffed to strategies for managing lines and signage for orienting people. “It’s not like we don’t have experience doing this,” Kwong says. “It’s about preparing for multiple scenarios and trying to be as responsible as possible.” In fact, administering the flu shot this influenza season will be a good trial run for getting out a COVID-19 vaccine. Although physical-distancing measures and travel restrictions might mean a milder flu season, health care officials in Canada are expecting higher demand this winter. “We know we will have smaller, more frequent clinics because large clinics become a large gathering,” Dubey says. Expect longer hours, assigned appointments, and perhaps even at-home vaccinations, especially for high-risk or vulnerable people. “We’re also reimagining our school-based clinics because we know that doing vaccines in schools is going to look different this year,” she says. “That’s preparation for COVID-vaccine planning for sure.” We are, by now, well accustomed to thinking in waves: waves of COVID-19 infections, waves of lockdown measures, waves of fear and fatigue. Almost certainly, we will also have to contend with waves of vaccination as batches roll off manufacturing lines or we wait for new candidates to be approved. Still, someone is going to be first to pull up a sleeve. “We want the vaccine now, and we want enough for everybody,” McGeer says. “But, if we have enough vaccine for 5 percent of the population, then who will be that 5 percent?” The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), formed back in 1964 to review administering the polio vaccine, among others, makes recommendations on immunization practices and schedules, including which populations should get the vaccine first. “We look at age-specific risks for disease and complications, the ability of people to respond to the vaccine according to age, and whether there is a risk because of occupation,” says NACI vice-chair Shelley Deeks. “Not only do we want to protect the vulnerable but, because this a pandemic, we want to ensure essential services can continue.” NACI advises on priorities, but because health care is a provincial responsibility, it’s up to the provinces and territories to actually implement those recommendations. “There are real differences that might result in different strategies based on where you are,” Mc-Geer says. “Who you target in Nunavut is not the same as in downtown Toronto.” The expectation is that provinces have a closer eye on the particular needs of their communities. And it’s the provinces that actually set most of the disease-control goals. Do you vaccinate to prevent mortality? In that case, for this virus, the elderly need to be prioritized. Do you vaccinate to reduce transmission and spread? There are some house-partying twentysomethings in Kelowna who could get the jab. Or do you vaccinate widely in an attempt to achieve herd immunity? NACI advises that front line workers be prioritized because they’re at a greater risk of infection based on the work they do. But that’s not axiomatic: “There’s no commandment in the bible of pandemic response that health care workers go first,” Upshur says. “You have to make arguments, and those arguments are based partly on data and partly on ethics.” We know that racialized and low-income people are infected at rates wildly disproportionate to their populations, not for any epidemiological reason but because of historical and economic disadvantages. This inequality persists for those working in the health care system itself: The Lancet published a study of almost 100,000 front line health care workers in the UK and US, which found that racialized workers were nearly twice as likely as their white colleagues to come down with COVID-19. Should decision making about vaccine prioritization be based on structural social causes instead? But history complicates that approach as well: a long tradition of surveillance and systemic discrimination in the health care system gives racialized people a very good reason not to want to go first. “In a public health emergency, where you’re using a vaccine that doesn’t have a lot of safety and effectiveness data, there’s obviously some concern about giving it to the most vulnerable groups, who might feel they’re being used as guinea pigs,” says Alison Thompson, an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s pharmacy school whose research focuses on the ethics of vaccines. “I think it’s really about being as transparent as possible through this entire process of development, manufacturing, and distribution. People need to be able to see what’s in the needle.” That transparency could also help persuade the one in six Canadians who currently say they would not get the vaccine. Though it can feel like this virus has been with us for roughly eight centuries, it’s not yet been twelve months. In that time, a few hundred vaccine candidates have been created, dozens have entered human trials, and pretty much every promising new technology has been pressed into action. Work that would normally occur in sequence and stall on some bureaucrat’s desk is now, thanks to huge financial investments by governments around the world, happening swiftly and in tandem. “The speed is not from sacrificing safety,” the WHO’s Crowcroft says. “It’s sacrificing money.” That still won’t buy an end to this pandemic as quickly as we’d like: there’s much mask-wearing and social distancing and staying home ahead. But the average new vaccine takes about a decade to make it to market. The fastest ever to make it to market, for mumps, arrived in four years.

Thousands of Nicotiana benthamiana plants, a close cousin of tobacco, grow in long rows amid noisy ventilation. When the plants are six or seven weeks old, maybe twenty centimetres tall, they go on a journey, lined up by the dozens onto a flatbed that’s then inverted over a tank filled with fluid. The plants get dunked. The tank seals. And the roots are trapped in the air between the liquid and the lid, so a vacuum hose can slip into that space and begin to suck. The plants act like sponges: apply pressure to the roots and the leaves collapse; release that pressure a minute later and they expand, absorbing the liquid deep into their cells. This particular bath is filled with a bacteria that’s been slightly tweaked. Bits of its DNA have been swapped out for DNA from the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Pandemic Is Intensifying the Opioid Crisis How to Lift a Lockdown Your Brain on COVID-19 Once the plants come out of the tank, they’re moved to an incubation chamber, the temperature, light, and humidity tightly controlled. For the next week or so, the bacteria will insert its genetic information into the plants, triggering the production of millions of spike proteins in every cell of the infected leaves. The spikes self-assemble into something called a virus-like particle—not the virus itself but a particle roughly the size and shape of SARS-CoV-2. Gowned workers come and harvest the plants, stripping the leaves like they’re plucking basil for pesto, then send them on a conveyor belt that passes through what’s basically a paper shredder. The chopped-up leaves head next into a vat of enzymes and are left to soak overnight. The enzymes work to break apart the cell walls, releasing the viruslike particles so they can be collected, purified, and converted into a yellowish vaccine. This doppelgänger for SARS-CoV-2 can’t inflict any real damage, but “when you inject it into someone, the immune system sees it as though it’s the real virus and thinks, Oh my God, there’s an invader here,” says Medicago executive Nathalie Landry. “And then it will trigger a good immune response.” A vaccine is, in essence, a trick—a sleight of hand that convinces your body to mount a counterattack to a given pathogen before that pathogen actually infects you. There are various ways to pull the trick off: vaccines can be made with a weakened virus, or a killed virus, or just a key part of the virus, or a part of the virus piggybacking on a different, benign virus, or an instruction manual for making that part of the virus yourself. In each approach, you get the benefits of an immune response without the messy business of a disease. It’s a crucial tool for combatting a virus impervious to borders, seasonality, and many of the lockdown measures employed by anxious nations. So, when US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci tells Congress, as he did in July, that he’s optimistic a vaccine will be ready in late 2020 or early 2021, it’s tempting to imagine that as the moment when we can once again engage in all the activities that remain laced with fear, like hopping a plane, or seeing a concert, or hugging a grandpa. An effective vaccine represents an enormous, exciting move in that direction. But it’s not the pandemic finish line—it’s more like a pandemic off-ramp. Epidemiological, logistical, and ethical roads still lie ahead: to determine how long and how well that vaccine’s protection can last, to manufacture enough of it to jab into billions of arms, to allocate the first batches of supply between countries and within their populations, and to persuade vaccine skeptics to roll up a sleeve. We’re trying to protect the entire planet, all 7.8 billion of us. “The job isn’t done when you’ve got an effective vaccination,” says Ross Upshur, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health who cochairs the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 ethics working group. “The job is done when you get that vaccine out to everyone who needs it.” Humans have been trying to outsmart viruses for millennia. By the late 1600s, Chinese doctors had formalized their recipe: grind a smallpox scab into a powder and blow it up a healthy patient’s nose. (Apparently, for boys, this was done in the left nostril, and for girls, the right.) An ambassador to Britain sent reports of seventeenth-century North African surgeons making a small incision between the thumb and forefinger, then squeezing smallpox pus into the wound. At the turn of the nineteenth century, Edward Jenner extracted fluid from a cowpox blister, taken from—who else?—a milkmaid, and scratched it into the arm of an eight-year-old boy. These efforts may seem crude now—we prefer our vaccines packed tidily in glass vials, injected though sterile hypodermic needles—but the idea remains the same: teach the immune system how to ward off a virus so it has a head start should infection occur. A vaccine is, in essence, a trick—a sleight of hand that convinces your body to mount a counterattack to a given pathogen before that pathogen actually infects you When a new pathogen invades the human body, our innate immune system recognizes the presence of something noxious and sends up an alarm. The first responders are proteins that meddle with a virus in order to limit its ability to reproduce. “This is what’s called the dumb part of the immune system, though that’s quite mean because it’s not dumb at all,” says Brian Ward, an infectious-disease professor at McGill University and the medical officer for Medicago. But it’s also not precise: the innate immune system attacks anything that appears foreign and troublesome. Cue the adaptive immune system. “When cells are infected with a pathogen, they gobble it up, break it into pieces, and then start showing those pieces to the cells, saying, Hey, I found something that doesn’t belong here, can you please get rid of it?” says Marc-André Langlois, a molecular virologist at the University of Ottawa. B cells (a type of white blood cell) begin making antibodies: proteins that can subdue a virus by blocking its ability to get into the body’s cells. T cells (another type of white blood cell) arrive with two purposes: to help B cells make more antibodies and to assassinate cells that have been infected by the virus. It’s a more sophisticated response, but it’s also slower, taking a week, sometimes longer, to mobilize. “So, if you have a rapidly replicating virus, and it doubles, doubles, doubles, waiting seven days for antibodies might be too long and you might not survive,” Langlois says. If the infection is cleared, many of the body’s B and T cells then die off themselves. Some, though, transform into memory cells, typically bunkered down in your bone marrow, where they wait to spring into action the next time that same pathogen attacks. “All it takes is one B cell to recognize the target and get activated, and it will start proliferating so it can produce the antibodies,” Langlois says. “That’s why vaccines work. They give you this life-saving element of having the antibodies ready to be deployed.” A defence that would otherwise take the body weeks to mount can be summoned in just a few hours. We’ve come a long way from smallpox pus, but to develop a vaccine, scientists still need to pick their poison. In modern medicine, that decision involves choosing whether to use the entire virus or just a vital part of it. Whole-virus vaccines are the traditional approach. One strategy, dating back to the 1930s, is to take the pathogen—grown in giant batches of chicken eggs or, decades later, in cells—and then kill it, usually with heat, chemicals, or radiation. Because the virus is dead, it doesn’t cause disease once introduced to the body, even in people with weakened immune systems; because the virus is dead, it also doesn’t always cause a strong immune response, often requiring multiple doses. This approach is used in the flu shot and a hepatitis A vaccine, as well as in the one for polio, which a global vaccination effort has essentially wiped out. In a more recent variation on the whole-virus vaccine, a pathogen is weakened in a lab rather than killed outright. Chances are you’ve been jabbed with a bunch of these vaccines: they’re how we fight measles, chicken pox, yellow fever, and tuberculosis. Here, the cost-benefit analysis is reversed: because the vaccine closely resembles a natural infection, it typically elicits a robust, enduring response; because the vaccine is more potent, though, people with compromised immune systems are often unable to get it at all. But, by using the entire virus, the vaccine builds an immune response to many different parts of the pathogen. “The whole-virus vaccine is like a big shield in front of you,” Ward says. “If you’re in a Star Wars movie and someone is shooting lasers at you, you’re much safer behind that shield.” Yet a smaller shield, precisely positioned, can still protect you by blocking an important part of the virus rather than the whole thing. There are several ways of introducing this target protein—which is called the antigen—to the body. Most of them require another ingredient to fortify the shield: an adjuvant, usually aluminum, which for the past ninety years has been added to vaccines to boost the immune response. “An adjuvant is a little like hot sauce,” says Robert Kozak, a microbiologist at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. It livens up what’s already on your plate. One method of delivering the target protein to your body is to deploy a weakened common-cold virus, called an adenovirus, as a microscopic Trojan horse. That cold virus is unlikely to cause much damage, but it’s hugely efficient at slipping inside cells and releasing the antigen. Though scientists see promise in this approach, only one adenovirus vaccine has ever been approved, anywhere. In part, that’s because vaccines tend not to make a ton of money, and it’s wildly expensive to develop a new platform, so funding can be hard to come by. It’s also because adenovirus-vaccine candidates are in human trials for complicated diseases, like HIV and malaria, which are challenging targets. Another method skips the Trojan horse altogether and injects you directly with the pathogen’s critical protein. Virus-like-particle vaccines, such as Medicago’s plant-grown candidate, are a type of these protein-based vaccines. It’s a proven method—HPV and hepatitis B are just two examples—and there are usually few side effects once you’re given the shot. Then there are genetic vaccines, which don’t deliver the antigen itself but instead issue a blueprint of that target protein to our bodies, hijacking our own cells to produce it. In a DNA vaccine, DNA containing the gene for the antigen is delivered to the cells. The cells copy those genetic instructions into molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which issue marching orders to the body to assemble the antigen. “The antigen is then presented to the immune system, [which] mounts a defence,” says Gary Kobinger, one of the scientists behind the Ebola vaccine, who is now working on a DNA candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine for Laval University. It’s a relatively new method of vaccination, though Kobinger points out that, “in the field of experimental vaccines, it’s quite old,” a technology discovered back in the early ’90s. Messenger RNA vaccines bypass the DNA and go straight to the marching orders. The genetic material for the antigen is produced synthetically, then packed inside a pod made of lipid molecules, which slide easily into the cells. The benefits are that there’s no messing around with infectious material and the vaccine’s production time can be cut down dramatically, which is why some researchers believe a genetic vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready first. The disadvantage is that this is uncharted territory: no DNA or mRNA vaccines are currently approved for human use. SARS-CoV-2 is a stealthy operator. It has a gift for binding its spike proteins—those knobby mushrooms that every coronavirus illustration has burned into our brain —to receptors on particular cells scattered in high numbers along the lining of our respiratory tract. When contact is made, it creates an opening through which the virus can pour its genetic code, the RNA, inside our bodies. “The moment the RNA enters the body, it takes [over] the cell—there’s no wasting time,” says Natalia Martin Orozco, vice-president of drug development at Toronto-based Providence Therapeutics, which pivoted from developing an mRNA vaccine for cancer to one for COVID-19. The first proteins that SARS-CoV-2 produces are not to make more copies of itself but instead to suppress an immune response. “It says, Okay, let’s block everything that is going to stop me from multiplying,” Martin Orozco says. “After that, it starts producing what it needs to build the virus and grow.” There are now more than 200 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 in development around the world, using every conceivable approach. The vast majority of them, however, zero in on the spike as the vaccine’s target protein: the University of Oxford, Johnson & Johnson, and CanSino Biologics all insert the spike into weakened common-cold viruses; Novavax’s vaccine attaches the proteins to microscopic particles that are used as carriers; Moderna and Pfizer’s candidates encode the spike into their mRNA. It’s a good bet. The spikes are found in abundance on the surface of the virus, so they’re what our immune system sees first. “With the first SARS, we saw that the virus used the spike protein to enter cells,” says Kozak. “Viruses can be shockingly unoriginal sometimes, so if blocking that protein protected you against SARS One, it will probably work against SARS Two.” Not all of these candidates, in the end, will work—many of them won’t. (A sobering statistic: one 2016 study found that nearly nine out of every ten new drugs fail in the human-testing phase.) And it’s not yet clear what exactly will ward this virus off. “We don’t know the relative importance and contribution of antibodies and T cells in terms of protection against COVID,” says Manish Sadarangani, director of the Vaccine Evaluation Center, in Vancouver. Immunity isn’t an on/off switch: there are multiple levels of protection conferred by either shaking off a disease or receiving its vaccine. Some vaccines, like the one for hepatitis A, provide sterilizing immunity, which prevents the infection and its transmission almost entirely. Others, like those for diphtheria and tetanus, generate neutralizing immunity, where an infection can occur but won’t get very far and can’t make someone sick. Sometimes, as with the shingles vaccine, recipients aren’t fully covered but experience a milder version of the disease. Often, protection isn’t life-long, so we need booster shots to shore up our immunity. When it comes to coronaviruses, immune responses tend to be short-lived: two to three years for the first SARS virus, for example, after which people exposed to that same pathogen would likely fall sick once again. Still, three years of protection sounds pretty good right now. As Martin Orozco says, “Even if the vaccine lasted just one season, that, to me, would be a really great accomplishment.” In the midst of a pandemic, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that performs as well as a flu shot is nothing to sneeze at. Twice a year a consortium of scientists representing more than 100 influenza centres in more than 100 countries descends on the World Health Organization (WHO) to pick the flu strains that should be combatted by seasonal vaccines. For the northern hemisphere, these selections are made in February; for the southern hemisphere, September. Once the recommendations are made, the viruses are produced in WHO laboratories, then shipped to the companies around the world that manufacture the corresponding vaccines. There is no centralized body whipping up batches of SARS-CoV-2 for developers looking to try their hand at a COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, they need the genetic code for the virus, which Chinese researchers sequenced in the second week of January and shared in a public database. Once scientists determined what was inside the 30,000 “letters” of this coronavirus’s RNA, they could decide which proteins to target in their vaccines. After developers pick their antigen and their delivery system, they test it, starting with animals. Because ferrets and hamsters are, like us, naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, they were a popular choice for early vaccine trials at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (vido-InterVac). If the vaccine protects those animals from infection, the next step is a safety trial with dozens of people, to see if fevers spike or injected arms swell, followed by another trial, which measures how well an immune response to the virus has been produced. Then it’s on to the third trial, where thousands of volunteers are monitored for a statistically significant difference between rates of infection in an unvaccinated control group and in people who actually got the jab. At least half a dozen leading candidates have entered phase-three trials, including ones from the University of Oxford, Moderna, and Pfizer. Currently, the WHO has set the minimum bar for an effective vaccine at an infection-reduction rate of 50 percent, though 70 percent is preferred. What’s needed to make enough doses for these trials depends on the type of vaccine. For Medicago’s plantbased candidate, there must be wellstocked greenhouses and a dunking tank. To take another example: at vido-InterVac, where researchers are working on a protein-based vaccine, they begin with a single cell. “We take the gene from the virus that encodes for the spike protein, and we put that gene into the single cell, which now thinks it is its own protein,” says vido-InterVac director and ceo Volker Gerdts. At first, scientists use a three-litre beaker that contains everything necessary to make a cell happy: some sugars, a couple of amino acids, a nice warm environment, and a little CO2, so the cell is fooled into believing it’s still in a body. One cell divides into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen; the three-litre beaker becomes twenty litres, then 250, all the way up to a 1,000- or 2,000-litre bioreactor. From one individual cell, you can make enough of the protein for thousands, even millions of doses. Gerdts’s team wants just that protein in its vaccine, without sugar or waste or any of those extra bits. To isolate the spike, the liquid will get separated in a centrifuge: spun so the heavier waste and cell walls fall to the bottom, leaving the lighter protein on top. It will then get purified, so anything else that lingers is removed. “It gets really cleaned up to the point where you just have a very concentrated, pure substance,” Gerdts says. “And then you put it in a glass vial.” Making a successful vaccine is one challenge. Making enough of it to satisfy world demand is another. There are, of course, all sorts of regulations and standards concerning how to go about production: “I can’t head into my basement and start brewing up a vaccine,” says Curtis Cooper, president of the Canadian Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Every facility needs to conform to Good Manufacturing Practices (gmp), which are exceptionally specific rules set out by the WHO that ensure quality control. You want consistency over time so that each successive batch is precisely the same. Many Canadian labs can produce enough vaccine for their clinical research under these strict gmp conditions. But, when it comes to scaling up production, we’re not in nearly as strong a position. Gerdts says that there are two facilities in Canada with large-scale production capacity: Medicago and the National Research Council, which partnered with CanSino Biologics to produce its vaccine and received a recent $126 million federal boost. At Medicago’s clinical facility in Quebec City, 20 million doses of its plant-based vaccine, if successful, can roll out over a year; there’s a commercial facility in North Carolina that can manufacture another 100 million doses annually for whoever signs a contract. A third facility is slated to be built in Quebec, with greenhouses the size of two football fields, though that won’t be completed until 2023. And, in March, vido-InterVac received $23.3 million from the Canadian government, half of which will be used to complete its own much larger facility, which should be ready by next July. In the meantime, Gerdts is compelled to wait until another manufacturer can begin to produce his candidate. “Canada does not have the manufacturing capacity that is needed for making a vaccine for the world,” he says. “We’re not even close to making enough for Canadians.” What happened? Marc-André Langlois believes that—at least before this very moment—there wasn’t much of an appetite to equip the country for a hypothetical pandemic. “It’s generally unpopular to invest in preparedness, because you have all the other urgent commitments that start creeping up,” he says. “People might not want $300 million spent on making a vaccine-manufacturing facility for another virus that could potentially burn out.” Illustration by Glenn Harvey. It’s also a predictable outcome of operating in a global economy. “We outsource a lot of our vaccine procurement to these big multinationals in Europe, and we have not invested in the production capacity in Canada,” says vido-InterVac’s associate director of business development, Paul Hodgson. Canadian branches of international pharmaceutical companies, like GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur, are capable of producing other vaccines, but “it’s not like they have extra capacity just sitting there to push a new vaccine through,” he says. “It’s a matter of priorities—when there’s an opioid crisis or roads need repairs, where do you put the money? But, if you think research is expensive, you should try disease.” That has sent Canada looking for supplies elsewhere. The federal government has ordered 75 million syringes and needles from medical-technology company Becton Dickinson, enough to inoculate nearly every Canadian twice, and issued bids to secure a similar quantity of alcohol swabs, gauze strips, and bandages. “Our government is working on all possible fronts to deliver safe and effective treatments and vaccines to Canadians as quickly as possible,” procurement minister Anita Anand says. “What this means is, while we are working with domestic suppliers, we are also pursuing international arrangements.” In early August, she announced the first of these arrangements: a pair of deals with American companies Pfizer and Moderna for tens of millions of doses of their respective mRNA vaccines. By month’s end, Canada had also secured 38 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s candidate and 76 million doses of Novavax’s vaccine. Plenty of other countries inked deals of their own this summer: the UK reserved 100 million doses of the University of Oxford’s vaccine while the US secured another 300 million—that’s nearly a quarter of Oxford’s projected annual supply gone. By mid-August, preorders of COVID-19 vaccine candidates were reportedly stretching toward 6 billion doses, almost all of them claimed by wealthy nations. None of these vaccines has yet been proven to work. There’s another risk in relying on international sources: the goods might never show up. Early in the pandemic, for example, the White House ordered medical manufacturing titan 3M to stop exporting N95 face masks to Canada and elsewhere until the US shored up its own supply. The clinical trial for CanSino’s vaccine candidate was meant to start in Halifax this past May. Chinese customs refused to release the shipment; by late summer, the trial had to be called off. Global initiatives do exist to try to level the vaccination playing field. The international immunization nonprofit Gavi is pooling money from dozens of highand middle-income countries to invest in a number of vaccine candidates, including Oxford’s, with the aim of manufacturing 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. That’s meant to be enough for each country to vaccinate 20 percent of its population, with an emphasis on front line workers and vulnerable groups and with the cost fully covered for low-income nations. In June, Canada pledged $120 million to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a global project that includes Gavi’s vaccine-distribution initiative. China and the US haven’t contributed. But every country, company, and initiative will be competing for the same limited supplies; already, there have been murmurings of glass shortages that could curb the availability of vials. Stoppers are made by only a handful of companies. And it doesn’t take much to cause a major bottleneck. “At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn’t have enough nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests,” says Allison McGeer, a senior clinical physician at Toronto’s Sinai Health System. More than 100,000 swabs, ordered by the federal government, arrived in Ontario contaminated by mould. “These are tiny, [cheap] things, but if you don’t have any of them, you’re paralyzed,” she says. “There’s a long list of those things that go into vaccine manufacturing that have a potential to pose the same sort of problems. There only has to be one little grommet missing and the whole system doesn’t work.” Vaccines are designed to prevent infection. You don’t want to cause another infection altogether by putting that vaccine in a grimy vial. Sterilization is extremely important: this is a product moving from the outside world directly into our muscles. “We have to prepare and sterilize the vial, prepare and sterilize the stopper, all the tubing and fill needles, all the parts and pieces that would touch the vaccine,” says Christopher Procyshyn, co-founder of Vancouver-based Vanrx Pharmasystems. “Everything is individually sterilized and then brought together in an aseptic process, which basically means: don’t screw it up.” However it has been made, the vaccine arrives at a facility like Vanrx’s in a bag or a tank, frozen or in liquid form. It’s most often sterilized through microfiltration, which passes the product through a filter with pores smaller in diameter than any known bacteria. The glass vials also arrive and are sterilized: washed with purified water, then blasted with heat. “Glass is a greasy material, so we have to take it to a high enough temperature that we burn it off, much like a self-cleaning oven,” Procyshyn says. The vials go into a filling machine, where they’re sterilized using high-pressure steam, as are the stoppers and caps. In conventional technologies, what happens next “looks a lot like Laverne and Shirley—like a food-processing line,” Procyshyn says. “You have conveyor belts coming in,” and a machine positions a whole bunch of tubes, which, he continues, “squeeze in a pulsation manner and fill the vial with the liquid, the stopper, the cap.” Vanrx automates the process inside a large machine, where the filling is done by a robot. Procyshyn suspects that, given the need to conserve supplies, vaccines for COVID-19 will be packaged in multidose vials, enough to vaccinate twenty patients each. The fastest machines in the industry run around 600 units per minute: for one facility, on a full production day, that translates to somewhere between 15 and 20 million doses. “But don’t forget that other drugs are continuing to be made,” Procyshyn says. “Not all facilities are suitable for this, and Canada has fewer . . . than the US and Europe. A large part of what we’re working through right now is which vaccine at which available site and what capacity.” Now ensconced in its multidose vial, the vaccine is inspected by employees, labelled, and given a lot number, essential for safety tracking. After that, it has to be transported through the cold chain, a standard practice to ensure that, every time the vaccine is handed off, it maintains the appropriate temperature, typically between 2 and 8 degrees for refrigerated vaccines or -15 degrees for frozen ones. That means the moment it leaves the doorstep of the manufacturer, bundled in boxes wrapped in isothermal packaging, the vaccine is kept in chilly containers. The plane that transports it is refrigerated, as is the truck that picks it up from the airport, as is the wholesaler or warehouse in Canada where it’s kept before being moved to health care facilities across the country. “This is a well-established process,” says Mina Tadrous, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto’s Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. “We’ve been doing this for decades and we’re really good at it.” No one needs to rely on the diligence of others: surveillance systems exist to make sure that the cold chain hasn’t been broken. “It used to be that you’d carry in a box of vaccines, and there was a temperature probe inside that provided a continuous recording, so you’d make sure they hadn’t been frozen or gotten too hot,” McGeer says. Then, in 1996, the WHO introduced temperature-sensitive stickers that monitor the heat exposure of individual vaccine vials. “It’s a stellar development: a little colour-coded square that tells you whether it’s been out of temperature,” she says. The square starts lightly tinged; if it gets dark, the vial needs to be discarded. As a result, clinicians can determine whether the whole box has been compromised or just a few vaccine vials fell out of the cold chain. When supply is tight, it helps to have every possible vial on hand. We might be inventing a vaccine from scratch, but we’re not inventing a whole new system to get it into the arms of Canadians. “The best immunization system is almost invisible,” says Natasha Crowcroft, inaugural director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases and now a senior technical adviser at the WHO. “People talk about immunization being the victim of its own success: when everything is going smoothly, no one knows how much work goes on behind the scenes.” In Canada, this work involves a terrific amount of coordination between the federal government, responsible for procuring the vaccine; the provinces and territories, which determine how many doses they’ll need and which ones to deliver to which people; and local jurisdictions, which make on-the-ground decisions about administering it. When it comes to distributing vaccines for COVID-19, Canada will most likely take cues from the influenza-vaccination programs we have in place. For those, Health Canada approves and then bulk orders the vaccines, choosing a couple of different candidates in case there are manufacturing snafus or to target certain segments of the population—seniors tend to get a high-dose flu shot because their immune systems benefit from the added boost. Buying in bulk helps cushion the cost: Moderna, which has said it plans to make a profit from its SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, will lower the price for big orders. The provinces then determine how exactly to get the doses out, allotting a certain share to family doctors, public health clinics, community clinics, and pharmacies. Typically, they’ll also decide whether they will publicly fund vaccination and for whom. Ontario has a universal flu-vaccination program, for example, and BC and Quebec do not, though it’s hard to imagine that anyone will have to shell out for a COVID-19 shot. While flu shots are ordered and distributed based on how many people got one the previous year, planning for COVID-19 vaccines presents its own challenges: we don’t know what the supply is going to be, how well it will work in different populations, or how many doses the vaccine might require. “If they’re anticipating that we’re going to have tons of doses in a short period of time, then it would make sense to have as many vaccinators as possible,” says Jeff Kwong, epidemiologist and interim director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases. You could walk into your family doctor’s office, the local library, the nearest Shoppers Drug Mart or Pharmasave—take your pick. “But, if they’re going to have relatively low numbers of doses available each week, then having a more limited number of vaccinators is more efficient.” You don’t want to run into a situation where one physician has fifty doses sitting idly in a fridge while another scrambles to contend with an out-the-door line. For that reason, vaccines could be administered just in public health clinics. “After the H1N1 pandemic, we really spent a lot of time developing our mass-immunization clinic plan,” says Toronto’s associate medical officer of health, Vinita Dubey. “That was the time to detail some of the boots-on-the-ground logistics.” The plan includes everything from where to hold large vaccination clinics and how to keep them staffed to strategies for managing lines and signage for orienting people. “It’s not like we don’t have experience doing this,” Kwong says. “It’s about preparing for multiple scenarios and trying to be as responsible as possible.” In fact, administering the flu shot this influenza season will be a good trial run for getting out a COVID-19 vaccine. Although physical-distancing measures and travel restrictions might mean a milder flu season, health care officials in Canada are expecting higher demand this winter. “We know we will have smaller, more frequent clinics because large clinics become a large gathering,” Dubey says. Expect longer hours, assigned appointments, and perhaps even at-home vaccinations, especially for high-risk or vulnerable people. “We’re also reimagining our school-based clinics because we know that doing vaccines in schools is going to look different this year,” she says. “That’s preparation for COVID-vaccine planning for sure.” We are, by now, well accustomed to thinking in waves: waves of COVID-19 infections, waves of lockdown measures, waves of fear and fatigue. Almost certainly, we will also have to contend with waves of vaccination as batches roll off manufacturing lines or we wait for new candidates to be approved. Still, someone is going to be first to pull up a sleeve. “We want the vaccine now, and we want enough for everybody,” McGeer says. “But, if we have enough vaccine for 5 percent of the population, then who will be that 5 percent?” The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), formed back in 1964 to review administering the polio vaccine, among others, makes recommendations on immunization practices and schedules, including which populations should get the vaccine first. “We look at age-specific risks for disease and complications, the ability of people to respond to the vaccine according to age, and whether there is a risk because of occupation,” says NACI vice-chair Shelley Deeks. “Not only do we want to protect the vulnerable but, because this a pandemic, we want to ensure essential services can continue.” NACI advises on priorities, but because health care is a provincial responsibility, it’s up to the provinces and territories to actually implement those recommendations. “There are real differences that might result in different strategies based on where you are,” Mc-Geer says. “Who you target in Nunavut is not the same as in downtown Toronto.” The expectation is that provinces have a closer eye on the particular needs of their communities. And it’s the provinces that actually set most of the disease-control goals. Do you vaccinate to prevent mortality? In that case, for this virus, the elderly need to be prioritized. Do you vaccinate to reduce transmission and spread? There are some house-partying twentysomethings in Kelowna who could get the jab. Or do you vaccinate widely in an attempt to achieve herd immunity? NACI advises that front line workers be prioritized because they’re at a greater risk of infection based on the work they do. But that’s not axiomatic: “There’s no commandment in the bible of pandemic response that health care workers go first,” Upshur says. “You have to make arguments, and those arguments are based partly on data and partly on ethics.” We know that racialized and low-income people are infected at rates wildly disproportionate to their populations, not for any epidemiological reason but because of historical and economic disadvantages. This inequality persists for those working in the health care system itself: The Lancet published a study of almost 100,000 front line health care workers in the UK and US, which found that racialized workers were nearly twice as likely as their white colleagues to come down with COVID-19. Should decision making about vaccine prioritization be based on structural social causes instead? But history complicates that approach as well: a long tradition of surveillance and systemic discrimination in the health care system gives racialized people a very good reason not to want to go first. “In a public health emergency, where you’re using a vaccine that doesn’t have a lot of safety and effectiveness data, there’s obviously some concern about giving it to the most vulnerable groups, who might feel they’re being used as guinea pigs,” says Alison Thompson, an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s pharmacy school whose research focuses on the ethics of vaccines. “I think it’s really about being as transparent as possible through this entire process of development, manufacturing, and distribution. People need to be able to see what’s in the needle.” That transparency could also help persuade the one in six Canadians who currently say they would not get the vaccine. Though it can feel like this virus has been with us for roughly eight centuries, it’s not yet been twelve months. In that time, a few hundred vaccine candidates have been created, dozens have entered human trials, and pretty much every promising new technology has been pressed into action. Work that would normally occur in sequence and stall on some bureaucrat’s desk is now, thanks to huge financial investments by governments around the world, happening swiftly and in tandem. “The speed is not from sacrificing safety,” the WHO’s Crowcroft says. “It’s sacrificing money.” That still won’t buy an end to this pandemic as quickly as we’d like: there’s much mask-wearing and social distancing and staying home ahead. But the average new vaccine takes about a decade to make it to market. The fastest ever to make it to market, for mumps, arrived in four years. We’re virtually guaranteed to shatter that record for COVID-19—one more unprecedented event in an age already full of them.

What would it take to reform it? December 8, 2020December 10, 2020 - by Nadine CaronNadine Caron, Danielle Martin, Illustration by Pete Ryan, Updated 8:44, Dec. 10, 2020 | Published 14:10, Dec. 8, 2020 Eryn Dixon had enough to manage as it was. At the age of forty-five, with profound disabilities related to multiple sclerosis, Dixon was living in Almonte Country Haven, a long-term care facility on a grassy hill in eastern Ontario. Then, in March, she contracted COVID-19. As she lay unconscious and unresponsive, struggling on oxygen, her father, Rick, was told to say his final goodbyes. Against the odds, Dixon pulled through, but more than a third of her facility’s residents weren’t so lucky. Hers is just one of so many stories that we have been reading and watching and hearing for months—a catalogue of media reports every day, documenting COVID-19’s progression through our communities and the various ways it takes its toll. On May 4, Karam Singh Punian, age fifty-nine, did die of COVID-19. He was one of an estimated twenty Toronto airport taxi drivers who contracted the virus that month alone. Most of the 1,500 people who make their living driving passengers to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport are self-employed men who are newcomers to Canada. They work long hours in sedentary jobs and eat on the go, without access to health benefits or paid sick days. In early August, Patrice Bernadel, a much-loved Montreal pastry chef, suffered from COVID-19 in a different way. Like so many people in the restaurant industry, Bernadel had seen his business devastated by the pandemic. And, like so many self-employed Canadians, he had no guaranteed access to mental health services outside his doctor’s office or the emergency department. “The economic, social and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have destabilized his life to the point of diving him into a deep depression, preventing him from seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” his brother wrote in a Facebook post soon after Bernadel died by suicide. As COVID-19 took hold around the world in the spring, Canada prepared for one very specific kind of tragedy: the kind we saw unfold in Italy and in New York, one where hospitals were overwhelmed and ventilators in short supply. Thanks to good timing, hard work, and an economic shutdown that will have ripple effects for years, we have so far avoided that particular calamity. But, as Dixon’s, Punian’s, and Bernadel’s stories reveal, there are many kinds of tragedies: as a country, we were too slow to realize that there were—and are—other pandemic disasters happening all around us. The stories of COVID-19-affected Canadians are also stories about Canada and our health care systems—about which kinds of tragedies we go to great lengths to avoid and which we allow to persist. By comparison with the death count unfolding south of our border, many Canadians have felt very proud of how our country and its health systems—thirteen provincial and territorial systems, with some areas of federal responsibility as well—rose to meet the initial crisis of the pandemic. Canadian medicare has always meant more than a set of public insurance programs: we are prouder of it than we are of ice hockey or the maple leaf. The notion that access to health care should be based on need, not ability to pay, is a defining Canadian value, surviving along the longest shared border in the world with the country that hosts the most expensive, inequitable, profit-driven alternative imaginable. That difference in values is often emphasized in our political rhetoric, as when Jean Chrétien would say, “Down there, they check your wallet before they check your pulse.” We are two doctors working in very different environments and very different medical disciplines, and we have been seeing COVID-19 reinforce some basic lessons about Canada’s health care. First, our systems’ preexisting cracks become chasms when subjected to major shocks. Second, a conversation about health care that is divorced from the social factors that help determine how healthy you are is not really a meaningful conversation at all. And, third, perhaps the only lesson that should qualify as news: when they feel they have no alternative and the need is sufficiently great, governments, private-sector players, and individual people can make tremendous changes in very short order. The Hidden Costs of Medical Testing How Universal Health Care Fails Queer Communities The North Needs More Doctors Health care systems exist to prevent and treat illness. What this means, as a matter of medical practice and health policy, is a matter of enormous ongoing debate. When Tommy Douglas implemented public health insurance in 1947, his Saskatchewan government focused first on covering hospitals and later on medical care—at that time mainly defined as physician services. This model spread across the country in the decades that followed, with the support of the federal government and its spending power. Canada does a reasonably good job on these basics. Despite unevenness and variability, our national performance on a wide range of health indicators is generally strong. A person diagnosed with leukemia, for example, is less likely to die in Canada than in Ireland, Sweden, or France, the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study found. Similarly, someone who experiences a stroke in Canada is likely to have a better outcome than is someone in the US, South Korea, or Singapore. Just about any Canadian will tell you that the Achilles heel of our health care system—what is sometimes characterized as the price of these basics—is the wait time to get access to nonurgent care. It isn’t the kind of delay imagined by some American conservatives, in which “socialized health care” leaves people to exsanguinate on the sidewalk while they’re told to take a number. Rather, it’s the senior who, in line for a hip replacement, loses the chance to dance at her granddaughter’s wedding; the small-town teacher with chronic headaches waiting months for an outpatient neurology appointment; the parents, worried about their daughter’s shift in eating habits, recognizing that it will take months to get an eating-disorder assessment. In the “new normal” of COVID-19, that problem is worse. Public health efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus have been admirable and necessary, and the sacrifices within the health care system—delayed operations, cancelled clinic visits, postponed diagnostic testing—to prepare for a potential onslaught of cases were likely unavoidable. But the toll is steep and ongoing. Tens of thousands of cancelled procedures need to be rescheduled while hospitals grapple with a new reality that is much less efficient than the pre-COVID-19 world was. It is no longer prudent to have four patients in a single hospital room, let alone people on gurneys in the hallways; PPE must be conserved, so cases continue to be prioritized based on clinical factors; physical distancing must be respected. The high-volume churn of operating rooms for surgical cases is a thing of the past; everything just takes longer. There are other layers of service, unattended to during the first wave, that may declare their impacts in the coming months and years. In primary care, immunizations were delayed, diabetes management put on hold, and routine visits for diseases like schizophrenia or high blood pressure forgone. In Manitoba, there was a 25 percent drop in administered measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines between March and April for children two and under, the National Post reported. Meanwhile, BC Cancer, a wing of the province’s health authority, estimates that, in the first six weeks after the pandemic was declared, almost 250 British Columbians unknowingly had silent cancers go undiagnosed as their screening mammograms, colonoscopies, and pap smears were cancelled. And all that is still just the basics. Douglas dreamed of moving to a second stage of medicare, in which coverage would be much broader and the prevention of disease a bigger focus. That dream was never realized, and there are whole swaths of health care that are not included in our universal system at all. Instead, an ongoing emphasis on doctors and hospitals has led many observers to characterize Canada’s so-called universal health care coverage as “narrow and deep.” What we do provide (services like primary and specialty medical care, diagnostics, surgery) tends to be high quality; our health care system strives for equal access to care particularly by ensuring there are no financial charges for these services. If you are seen by a doctor or admitted to the hospital, if you need a CT scan or a blood test, if you require a biopsy or a specialist assessment, you will be well taken care of and never see a bill. But, if you are among the 20 percent of Canadians lacking adequate drug coverage and you walk out of your doctor’s office with a prescription for medication to treat your diabetes or high blood pressure or infection or depression, you may be on your own. If you require therapy with a psychologist for anxiety, or physiotherapy for your sports injury, or a root canal, your access will depend on your ability to pay. THE COST OF CUTTING CORNERS Debates about expanding our public health care plans to include medications, mental health care, home care, and a host of other medical services—and to move beyond treatment into true prevention—are as old as the plans themselves. Out-of-pocket health care spending (what you reach into your wallet to pay for, whether the full cost of a service or the co-payment or deductible) accounts for roughly 14 percent of total health care expenditures. Private insurance, often provided through our workplaces, accounts for another 12 percent. Of course, some of this is discretionary health spending (the massage you enjoy but that isn’t medically necessary, or that second pair of eyeglasses you get because they look cooler than your old ones do), but reliance on private spending and employment-dependent insurance is still higher in Canada than in most high-income nations. COVID-19 teaches us about which kinds of tragedies we go to great lengths to avoid and which we allow to persist. When one includes both public and private spending, health care amounts to 10.7 percent of our GDP, which is in the top third of OECD nations. But our government spending is actually lower than most of our comparator nations’. While 70 percent of health care spending is public in Canada, that number is 82 percent in the Netherlands, 77 percent in the UK, and 79 percent in New Zealand. Each of those countries’ universal health care systems includes both coverage of prescription medications with just nominal user fees and some degree of mental health care. Canada has long had the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world with universal health care that doesn’t include prescription drugs. We also have less public coverage of home care, dental care, and non-physician care outside hospitals—which includes services provided by everyone from social workers to psychologists and physiotherapists—than most comparator nations. For example, New Zealand’s publicly funded system includes long-term care, mental health care, physical therapy, and prescription drugs in addition to hospital and physician care. In Germany, mental health care, dental care, optometry, and prescription drugs are all covered by mandatory universal health insurance. While some public coverage for these services exists for some people in Canada, the amount differs by province and territory, and many people fall through the cracks. The result is that, in our purportedly universal system, many Canadians go without necessary services if they don’t have private insurance coverage, usually through their employers. And Douglas’s vision of a social democratic society that would take the broadest approach to alleviating the root causes of ill health—which include poverty, racism, and lack of education—has not dominated the political discourse for generations. Canada has moved so slowly on the journey to expand and improve medicare that it has been accused of a “paradigm freeze”—stuck in a system just good enough to prevent any major change or improvement from ever occurring. Indeed, current interest in COVID-19 treatments offers up a potential irony for Canada. If the efforts of the international research community yield a treatment—a tablet or liquid that could be taken to prevent hospitalization or a ventilator—millions among us would have no coverage for it. “During the H1N1 influenza, [several provincial governments] announced that the antiviral medication Tamiflu would be available free of cost to anyone who needed it,” says Irfan Dhalla, a vice-president at Unity Health Toronto and a practising physician at St. Michael’s Hospital. “A similar approach might occur should a COVID-19 treatment become available. However, this equitable approach [raises] the question: Why should one prescription medication be available to all based on need and not others?” In June 2019, then minister of health Ginette Petitpas Taylor tabled the final report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare. The report provided a blueprint for the stepwise implementation of a pharmacare program, developed in partnership with provinces and territories. In the context of a global pandemic, that partially shelved blueprint needs to be dusted off in a hurry. If prescription drug coverage is one urgent and obvious area of expansion, mental health care is another. In 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada found that 2.5 percent of respondents described having suicidal thoughts within the previous year. By May 2020, in the thick of the pandemic’s first wave, a survey found that number had more than doubled. Over and above the disruption experienced by all Canadians when the economy shut down, some people—including parents, people with preexisting mental illnesses, Indigenous people, those with a disability, and those who identify as LGBTQ—faced an increased risk of serious mental illness and suicide. This is the curve after the curve: the increasing mental health toll of economic devastation, social isolation, and mounting uncertainty that follows on the heels of our commendable collective efforts to squelch the spread of COVID-19. On average, about 4,000 people in Canada die by suicide each year. A recent study suggested that, as a consequence of COVID-19’s impact on employment alone, that number could go up by more than 25 percent in both 2020 and 2021. By comparison, in the first ten months of 2020, just over 10,000 people had died in Canada as a result of the disease itself. “After a disaster, population rates of psychological distress tend to double or triple,” the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported in July. Proposals for health care reform date back to long before the pandemic, but it took the pandemic to get action on implementing even some of them. Expanding publicly funded pharmacare and mental health care—moving closer to the promise of “universal” care—could be achieved through a variety of means, the easiest of which is generally understood to be a transfer of federal dollars to the provinces and territories to support part of the cost of such services, on the condition that they be provided free of charge to everyone already eligible for general health coverage. In other words, it would look exactly like medicare does right now, and your health card would be all you need. Canadians are already paying for these services, whether indirectly, by financing their workplace or private insurance coverage, or directly, by paying out of pocket for them. Each year, Canadians spend almost a billion dollars on mental health counselling, with 30 percent of that coming out of pocket. In the case of prescription drugs, we pay among the highest prices in the world because we don’t negotiate centrally. The report on the implementation of pharmacare put the price tag at $3.5 billion to launch a national program in 2022, with savings of $350 per year for the average family. We are also collectively, out of the public purse, currently paying the downstream costs of having a segment of the population that can’t afford such services and is forced to suffer the consequences. Removing out-of-pocket costs for medications used to treat diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory conditions alone would result in 220,000 fewer emergency-room visits and 90,000 fewer hospital stays annually, that same pharmacare report found. This would yield $1.2 billion a year in health care savings, just for those three common diseases. Similar results exist for mental health services. A 2017 study found that every dollar spent on publicly funded psychological services for depression would save Canada’s health system two dollars. Treating health conditions before they escalate and require hospital care improves medical outcomes, preserves quality of life, and saves money that could help offset the costs of program expansion. UNIVERSAL FOR WHOM? In the first wave of the pandemic, 81 percent of Canada’s COVID-19-related deaths were in long-term care (LTC) facilities. Our country was among the worst of all developed nations in preventing COVID-19 deaths in settings like the one where Eryn Dixon lived. A report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information concluded that countries with centralized regulation and organization of LTC, and those that implemented strict guidelines to prevent transmission of the virus at the same time as their lockdowns, fared best. In some parts of Canada, that didn’t happen until it was well past too late. Though some nonprofits fared badly and some for-profits did well, on average, the problem was worse in for-profit facilities, which had larger and more deadly COVID-19 outbreaks than their nonprofit counterparts did. The resulting headlines were scathing: “Majority of region’s long-term care deaths occurred in for-profit homes”; “Four out of five COVID-19 deaths have been linked to seniors’ homes. That says a lot about how Canada regards its elders.” Well over 200,000 Canadians live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. You know them; so do we. They are our parents living with dementia and frailty. Disproportionately, they are our mothers and grandmothers, the matriarchs of our families. On average, they are over eighty-five and face multiple health challenges, from chronic lung and heart disease to mobility issues to memory loss. Many Canadians are placed in LTC sooner than they and their families would like—and prematurely exposed to the accompanying risks of living in a congregate setting—because they cannot access the supports and services they need at home or in their communities. And, no matter when a loved one is moved to such a facility, we should be able to expect some consistency in the quality of care they will receive. But, for many years in Canada, quality-of-care indicators, like worsening symptoms of depression or increasing pain, have varied significantly between homes, and worse outcomes have long been documented in for-profit settings in both Ontario and BC, including a higher risk of death. This is at least in part because staffing levels tend to be lower in for-profit facilities. In addition, personal support workers (PSWs), nurses, and other LTC staff are among the lowest-paid and most insecure workers in our health care systems. Many fell ill with COVID-19 themselves and, in some tragic cases, unknowingly transmitted the virus across facilities where they worked multiple part-time jobs. COVID-19 “gives us an opportunity to reimagine LTC,” says Margaret McGregor, a family physician and a clinical associate professor at UBC medical school. “It’s time to change the staffing model in LTC so that PSW ratios of one worker to ten to fifteen residents are reduced to one worker to four to seven residents. This allows staff the time to provide holistic relational care. Much like daycare, these ratios should be funded, mandated, and enforced. More importantly, there is evidence that relational care, allowing staff the time to both care for and get to know their residents, improves seniors’ quality of life while improving PSWs’ conditions of work.” An even more uncomfortable truth: health outcomes in Canada are very contingent on who we are and where we live. Race and class figure heavily in the COVID-19 story because they figure heavily in all health outcomes in Canada. Neighbourhoods in Toronto with the lowest incomes, highest rates of unemployment, and highest concentrations of newcomers consistently had twice the number of COVID-19 cases and more than twice the rate of hospital admissions than those at the top end of Toronto’s income spectrum did. People experiencing homelessness, seasonal agricultural workers, and those living in congregate settings (everything from rooming houses to prisons) were suddenly acutely aware that their proximity to others put them directly in harm’s way. “Our initial response was focused on flattening the curve, not who was under the curve,” says Kwame McKenzie, an expert on the social causes of illness and the CEO of the Wellesley Institute. “But what is really worrying about these analyses is that they were predictable.” As of mid-September, the rate of those testing positive was 79 people per 100,000 for the white population. It was nearly seven times that for Black residents (547 per 100,000) and more than eight times that for Latin American Torontonians (643 per 100,000). We’ve long known that race, newcomer status, and income drive health outcomes. For example, Canadians of South Asian origin are three times more likely than the rest of the Canadian population is to develop type-two diabetes, and they have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. We also know that not everyone accesses health care services equitably. Research from Ontario and BC shows that women who are new to Canada are less likely to have their breast cancer captured through screening, and wait longer to be diagnosed, compared with Canadian-born women. First Nations people in BC have well documented but poorly understood increased incidence and decreased survival for colorectal cancer compared with the rest of British Columbians. But there is still so much we don’t know when it comes to how racism and bias affect both health and health care: most provinces and territories do not collect data about Indigeneity, race, or ethnicity in the health care system, so we lack the evidence we need to improve health equity. One crucial example: the COVID-19 rates of the 56 percent of First Nations people who live off-reserve are reflected only in the general-population statistics. Urban communities are not the only ones left behind: as the second wave of the pandemic crests in many parts of the country, rural and Northern communities have struggled and will continue to struggle to access COVID-19 care, as they face challenges to access health care at all times. The concern about access to specialists and critical-care resources such as ventilators is of course most pronounced in such locations, where sometimes there are simply none within hundreds of kilometres. Prior to the pandemic, First Nations people, Métis people, and Inuit living in rural and remote areas already faced long waitlists for specialist care and a shortage of available health practitioners, often delaying diagnoses and disrupting continuity of care. The distrust Indigenous peoples have in our health care system is informed by historical experiences in residential schools, Indian hospitals, and tuberculosis sanatoriums; it continues to be eroded by present-day racism. Hospital protocols limiting or eliminating family visits, while understandable efforts to reduce rates of COVID-19, may have perpetuated barriers for Indigenous people, many of whom feel unsafe when alone in health care institutions because of our country’s history and ongoing discrimination. One needs only to watch the video of Joyce Echaquan’s final moments to understand why. COVID-19 has exacerbated wait times for all Canadians, but where access was already poor or nonexistent, the burden is heaviest. Five years ago, Canada accepted the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report; in 2016, the country became a full supporter, without qualification, of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Despite these steps, disparities in the health and wellness of Indigenous people in Canada compared with that of non-Indigenous Canadians persist and, in some ways, are worsening. Poverty, crowded housing, unemployment, decreases to both quantity and quality of educational opportunities, struggles for food security, and diminished access to Indigenous languages, cultures, and traditional, unceded land—and the deep resilience and capacity that persist despite these impacts of colonization—all determine wellness and downstream health outcomes. Layered on top of these are the all-too-familiar elevated rates of trauma, suicide, addiction, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, and cancers—the root causes of which are all embedded in historical and current government policies. But let’s take a closer look. First Nations individuals living on reserves were thought to be sitting ducks for a COVID-19 outbreak: many reserves are located in rural, remote, and Northern areas, have decreased access to culturally safe medical care, and have minimal or no local access to the type of medical care acute COVID-19 patients may need. Yet these “high risk” communities did not fare as predicted in the first wave. Indeed, the percentage of First Nations individuals living on reserve who reported positive for COVID-19 by the end of July was one-quarter that of the general population, and the fatality rate only one-fifth. So far, Inuit communities have been largely spared from the pandemic as well. How? Many First Nations across the country closed their communities to outsiders in wave one by exercising sovereignty over their land and self-governance. Also key: the respect and priority naturally evident in First Nations communities for their Elders and knowledge holders, and their cultural reliance on the land. First Nations’ connection to the land has always been a vital part of their resilience as they protected the food sources, waterways, and traditional medicines that nourish their holistic health and well-being. For those who are often outdoors and in remote areas, physical distancing is a natural way of life. Is the rest of Canada capable of absorbing the lessons from Indigenous peoples and these practices? Perhaps we should. Despite these better-than-feared outcomes, COVID-19 has taken its toll on Indigenous people in other ways. Take the opioid crisis in BC. In April 2016, the province’s medical health officer declared a public health emergency due to the rising number of overdoses and deaths. BC’s First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) released data in July demonstrating a tragic exacerbation of this crisis within BC First Nations during COVID-19. First Nations overdose deaths increased by 93 percent in the first five months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and the percentage of First Nations people in the overall total of overdose deaths rose from 9.9 percent to 16 percent. (In BC, First Nations people constitute 3.3 percent of the population.) The FNHA postulates several explanations: an increase in drug use occurring when individuals were alone due to physical distancing, decreased access to and utilization of health care services, and increased toxicity of drugs as supply chains constricted during the pandemic. And the response to this crisis is markedly different. “When it comes to COVID,” Nel Wieman, the organization’s acting deputy chief medical officer, says, “the slogan essentially became, ‘We’re all in this together.’ And, when it comes to people who use substances, the thinking is, ‘I’m glad it’s you and not me.’” Whether one is talking about newcomers in the urban core of our largest cities or Indigenous people on reserve, the interplay between health and social factors is complex. Sometimes, a COVID-19 death is a death by overdose, or by suicide, rather than by a virus; we may come to see more kinds of COVID-19 deaths before the pandemic is over. BREAKING THE LOGJAM That we are in the midst of an opioid crisis is not news. Nor is it news that the staff at long-term care facilities are underpaid, or that there are too few of them. It isn’t news that pharmacare is long overdue, or that wait times are too long, or that even a universal public health care system leaves vulnerable populations behind. The real news is that we can do something about all these things. The opioid crisis in BC has persisted for years, yet the province flattened its first COVID-19 curve in four months. What COVID-19 has shown us is that, in the face of a terrifying possibility—mass death, an overwhelmed health care system—the excuses we use to justify the status quo dissolve, and profound change can happen much more quickly than we are used to imagining. Some of the logjams in both our services and our thinking have been broken. Early this year, even as hospitals were creating new critical-care wards and training their staff in the donning and doffing of PPE, other transformations were afoot. When Lindsey Longstaff’s seven-year-old son stepped on a nail this spring, she decided to try virtual care for the first time. Longstaff has severe asthma, and the nearest emergency department is in Regina, a forty-minute drive away, so she wanted to avoid a trip. After downloading a virtual-care app, Longstaff had an assessment with a nurse, sent photos of her son’s wound, and got a call from a doctor shortly afterward. She was told he didn’t need stitches and was shown how to clean and dress his wound herself—all of which was an exciting enough development in the speed and convenience of health care delivery that it got covered by CTV. Before COVID-19, virtual care seemed a long way off in Canada. In 2018, only 8 percent of Canadians reported having had a virtual visit with their health care provider. Today, many providers and hospitals rely on virtual care to check in with patients and monitor their conditions. In one survey, more than half of respondents said their most recent health encounters, in April, May, and June 2020, were virtual. The overnight adoption of billing codes for physicians doing virtual care, allowing us to be paid for providing these online and phone services just as we are for in-person visits, was game changing. Assuming those billing codes are here to stay, many of us will never go back to a time when a patient needed to come in person for a simple issue that could just as easily and safely be dealt with virtually. Canadians often assume that shortening our long wait times and expanding publicly funded services must involve more money, more hospitals, more operating-room time and more specialists. Of course, sometimes more resources are needed. But reorganizing and redeploying what we already have will get us pretty far. A rich literature exists on how to fix wait times in Canada. Interprofessional teams, which include skilled providers like nurses, pharmacists, and physiotherapists, reduce reliance on doctors, who are often the bottlenecks when it comes to health care waits. Single-entry models—in which patients are given the next available appointment with any qualified specialist in their region rather than waiting for a particular specialist—improve flow by using a single, common wait-list for a given procedure. Reducing demand is also important: scaling back on low-value tests and procedures is difficult to do, but the potential benefits are extremely high. Both patients and doctors tend to believe that providing more services, in the way of tests, treatments, and procedures, will result in better health outcomes, but often that isn’t the case. When it comes to interventions, more isn’t always better. Strengthening primary care and home care so that most care occurs with a provider who knows you well and is easily accessible is key to eliminating waits for specialists. And, in this day and age, the use of technology, like the kind used by Longstaff and her son, holds enormous potential. All of these have appeared in proposals and articles that date back to long before the pandemic, but it took the pandemic to get action on implementing even some of them. “For years,” says Chris Simpson, a cardiologist and former president of the Canadian Medical Association, “doctors have paid less attention to the unwanted clinical-practice variation that exists out there in the real world. Why do patients in one region get these tests and procedures at higher rates than other regions? The pandemic-induced slowdown . . . gives us an opportunity to look hard at our waiting lists. A hard look at appropriateness. A hard look at alternatives to surgical and procedural care, where appropriate. And a hard look at the huge clinical-practice variation in diagnostic testing. It’s an opportunity to improve the quality of the care we receive, to reduce low-value care, to enhance equity, and to use our resources in a wise and prudent way.” But, perhaps surprisingly, the experiment that may have had the biggest impact on health during COVID-19 didn’t take place in the health care system at all. Virtually overnight, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy stabilized the incomes of hundreds of thousands of Canadians; other emergency measures prevented residents from losing their housing. This is income support for the twenty-first century: easier to apply for, quicker to access and set up, structured not just to replace income but to supplement it. If we made programs like this permanent, reconfiguring them into a form of guaranteed annual income, the health benefits could be profound. Much more than by MRI machines or surgery, health is fostered when kids grow up in safe households, with nutritious food on the table and access to education, in a climate free of fear and trauma. “When public health measures closed down large tracts of the economy in response to COVID-19, we had a system up and running in a matter of weeks that didn’t require mountains of paperwork or intrusive ‘means testing,’” says Evelyn Forget, an economist in the department of community health sciences at the University of Manitoba. “All that was required, it seems, was a change in attitude. COVID-19 showed us that we can break through what we thought were hard limits on our ability to deliver income security.” This matters to doctors like us because financial stability is an even stronger influence on health than access to health services is: it’s social determinants of health, like income, education, and housing, that are far more influential. Between 1993 and 2014, in Ontario, residents of the poorest areas were more than twice as likely to die from a preventable cause than those living in the wealthier neighbourhoods were. People in the lowest income group are also less likely to receive health care when they need it and are 50 percent less likely than those in the highest income group are to see a specialist or receive care in the evenings or during the weekend. As the Canadian Medical Association has pointed out, there are hundreds of studies confirming that people in the lowest socioeconomic groups carry the greatest burden of disease. As a result, the CMA (among other bodies) has called for policy action to improve the social and economic circumstances of all Canadians. In time, we may learn that the CERB, widely viewed as an economic program, was the most important health program of the pandemic. Every night, for the period of time when the nation was most intensely gripped with preventing the virus’s spread, people would come out onto their balconies and porches to clap and cheer, banging pots and pans as a way of thanking health care providers and other essential workers for their contributions to keeping people safe. Of course, we were glad to see those contributions celebrated in this way, and we are proud of our work and the work of our colleagues and friends at the front lines of health care. But we couldn’t help but feel that those of us who work in health care should be the ones saying thank you. The extent to which Canada has so far avoided the worst-case scenario, sparing us from having to work in untenable and terrifying circumstances, is only because of the actions taken by the public. Physical distancing. Staying home. Socializing on Zoom. Wearing masks. Forgoing restaurants, movie theatres, visits to the gym, hugs with loved ones, birthday parties, long-planned trips. Scraping by without work. Working from home. Living on less. Home-schooling kids. Staying away from the bedsides of loved ones in the hospital. All this, and more, was done by each of us and all of us. Perhaps the biggest news of the pandemic is that people who normally do not see themselves as powerful are exactly that. Whether Canadians feel it or not, we have proven that we have the power to protect and enhance the health of our communities. That engagement, that willingness to pitch in to protect others, is what can now be harnessed in subsequent waves, in the recovery, and in the future we will build together. What remains to be seen is whether that power will indeed be harnessed. In the 1964 report that formed the blueprint for national medicare policy, justice Emmett Hall recommended that medications be included in Canada’s public health care plans so that people would not have to depend on their employers to ensure treatment. Recommendations to increase accountability and quality in long-term care date back to the 1966 Final Report of the Special Senate Committee on Aging in Canada. In 1974, Marc Lalonde, then minister of national health and welfare, issued a report called A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, in which he recommended that public health interventions should focus their attention on people with the highest risk of exposure to disease, such as those living in poverty. And, in 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report called on the government, “in consultation with Aboriginal peoples, to . . . close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities.” The problem isn’t that we don’t have a plan. In 2018, The Lancet published a special issue on Canadian health care. One of the two central papers (which we were privileged to co-author with a diverse group of researchers from across Canada) argued that this country needs a renewed social contract. “Universal health coverage is an aspiration, not a destination,” we wrote. Since then, the fallout from COVID-19 has served to further unmask the gaps in our health care that have long been written about by scholars across the country. It’s well past time to expand the core basket of medicare services to include pharmacare, mental health care, and other medical services we currently ignore, and to reimagine how health services are delivered in order to eliminate wait times for non-emergency services. To design progressive home-care services and smaller home-style institutions that could provide older people with the dignified care they deserve. To address suicide, mental health, addictions, chronic diseases, life expectancy, and the availability of health services within Indigenous communities. To treat the biggest causes of ill health—the ones that are rooted in social and economic inequity—instead of only the ones we find easy to identify under microscopes and in operating rooms. The familiar refrain for many followers of health and social reforms in Canada has been that we know what we need to do, we just need to do it. Now, through force of circumstance and perhaps without meaning to, we have finally begun the work. A terrifying glimpse of our own vulnerability has broken the logjam of health system reform, of income stabilization reform, of public and citizen engagement in health. Maybe this pandemic can mark a shift from wishful thinking to responsibility—from aspiration to expectation about what we actually mean and what we actually deliver when we say, so proudly, that our health care system is “universal.” We used to talk about whether big change would ever be possible. Now we know it is. The O’Hagan Essay on Public Affairs is an annual research-based examination of the current economic, social, and political realities of Canada.

What would it take to reform it? December 8, 2020December 10, 2020 - by Nadine CaronNadine Caron, Danielle Martin, Illustration by Pete Ryan, Updated 8:44, Dec. 10, 2020 | Published 14:10, Dec. 8, 2020 Eryn Dixon had enough to manage as it was. At the age of forty-five, with profound disabilities related to multiple sclerosis, Dixon was living in Almonte Country Haven, a long-term care facility on a grassy hill in eastern Ontario. Then, in March, she contracted COVID-19. As she lay unconscious and unresponsive, struggling on oxygen, her father, Rick, was told to say his final goodbyes. Against the odds, Dixon pulled through, but more than a third of her facility’s residents weren’t so lucky. Hers is just one of so many stories that we have been reading and watching and hearing for months—a catalogue of media reports every day, documenting COVID-19’s progression through our communities and the various ways it takes its toll. On May 4, Karam Singh Punian, age fifty-nine, did die of COVID-19. He was one of an estimated twenty Toronto airport taxi drivers who contracted the virus that month alone. Most of the 1,500 people who make their living driving passengers to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport are self-employed men who are newcomers to Canada. They work long hours in sedentary jobs and eat on the go, without access to health benefits or paid sick days. In early August, Patrice Bernadel, a much-loved Montreal pastry chef, suffered from COVID-19 in a different way. Like so many people in the restaurant industry, Bernadel had seen his business devastated by the pandemic. And, like so many self-employed Canadians, he had no guaranteed access to mental health services outside his doctor’s office or the emergency department. “The economic, social and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have destabilized his life to the point of diving him into a deep depression, preventing him from seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” his brother wrote in a Facebook post soon after Bernadel died by suicide. As COVID-19 took hold around the world in the spring, Canada prepared for one very specific kind of tragedy: the kind we saw unfold in Italy and in New York, one where hospitals were overwhelmed and ventilators in short supply. Thanks to good timing, hard work, and an economic shutdown that will have ripple effects for years, we have so far avoided that particular calamity. But, as Dixon’s, Punian’s, and Bernadel’s stories reveal, there are many kinds of tragedies: as a country, we were too slow to realize that there were—and are—other pandemic disasters happening all around us. The stories of COVID-19-affected Canadians are also stories about Canada and our health care systems—about which kinds of tragedies we go to great lengths to avoid and which we allow to persist. By comparison with the death count unfolding south of our border, many Canadians have felt very proud of how our country and its health systems—thirteen provincial and territorial systems, with some areas of federal responsibility as well—rose to meet the initial crisis of the pandemic. Canadian medicare has always meant more than a set of public insurance programs: we are prouder of it than we are of ice hockey or the maple leaf. The notion that access to health care should be based on need, not ability to pay, is a defining Canadian value, surviving along the longest shared border in the world with the country that hosts the most expensive, inequitable, profit-driven alternative imaginable. That difference in values is often emphasized in our political rhetoric, as when Jean Chrétien would say, “Down there, they check your wallet before they check your pulse.” We are two doctors working in very different environments and very different medical disciplines, and we have been seeing COVID-19 reinforce some basic lessons about Canada’s health care. First, our systems’ preexisting cracks become chasms when subjected to major shocks. Second, a conversation about health care that is divorced from the social factors that help determine how healthy you are is not really a meaningful conversation at all. And, third, perhaps the only lesson that should qualify as news: when they feel they have no alternative and the need is sufficiently great, governments, private-sector players, and individual people can make tremendous changes in very short order. The Hidden Costs of Medical Testing How Universal Health Care Fails Queer Communities The North Needs More Doctors Health care systems exist to prevent and treat illness. What this means, as a matter of medical practice and health policy, is a matter of enormous ongoing debate. When Tommy Douglas implemented public health insurance in 1947, his Saskatchewan government focused first on covering hospitals and later on medical care—at that time mainly defined as physician services. This model spread across the country in the decades that followed, with the support of the federal government and its spending power. Canada does a reasonably good job on these basics. Despite unevenness and variability, our national performance on a wide range of health indicators is generally strong. A person diagnosed with leukemia, for example, is less likely to die in Canada than in Ireland, Sweden, or France, the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study found. Similarly, someone who experiences a stroke in Canada is likely to have a better outcome than is someone in the US, South Korea, or Singapore. Just about any Canadian will tell you that the Achilles heel of our health care system—what is sometimes characterized as the price of these basics—is the wait time to get access to nonurgent care. It isn’t the kind of delay imagined by some American conservatives, in which “socialized health care” leaves people to exsanguinate on the sidewalk while they’re told to take a number. Rather, it’s the senior who, in line for a hip replacement, loses the chance to dance at her granddaughter’s wedding; the small-town teacher with chronic headaches waiting months for an outpatient neurology appointment; the parents, worried about their daughter’s shift in eating habits, recognizing that it will take months to get an eating-disorder assessment. In the “new normal” of COVID-19, that problem is worse. Public health efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus have been admirable and necessary, and the sacrifices within the health care system—delayed operations, cancelled clinic visits, postponed diagnostic testing—to prepare for a potential onslaught of cases were likely unavoidable. But the toll is steep and ongoing. Tens of thousands of cancelled procedures need to be rescheduled while hospitals grapple with a new reality that is much less efficient than the pre-COVID-19 world was. It is no longer prudent to have four patients in a single hospital room, let alone people on gurneys in the hallways; PPE must be conserved, so cases continue to be prioritized based on clinical factors; physical distancing must be respected. The high-volume churn of operating rooms for surgical cases is a thing of the past; everything just takes longer. There are other layers of service, unattended to during the first wave, that may declare their impacts in the coming months and years. In primary care, immunizations were delayed, diabetes management put on hold, and routine visits for diseases like schizophrenia or high blood pressure forgone. In Manitoba, there was a 25 percent drop in administered measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines between March and April for children two and under, the National Post reported. Meanwhile, BC Cancer, a wing of the province’s health authority, estimates that, in the first six weeks after the pandemic was declared, almost 250 British Columbians unknowingly had silent cancers go undiagnosed as their screening mammograms, colonoscopies, and pap smears were cancelled. And all that is still just the basics. Douglas dreamed of moving to a second stage of medicare, in which coverage would be much broader and the prevention of disease a bigger focus. That dream was never realized, and there are whole swaths of health care that are not included in our universal system at all. Instead, an ongoing emphasis on doctors and hospitals has led many observers to characterize Canada’s so-called universal health care coverage as “narrow and deep.” What we do provide (services like primary and specialty medical care, diagnostics, surgery) tends to be high quality; our health care system strives for equal access to care particularly by ensuring there are no financial charges for these services. If you are seen by a doctor or admitted to the hospital, if you need a CT scan or a blood test, if you require a biopsy or a specialist assessment, you will be well taken care of and never see a bill. But, if you are among the 20 percent of Canadians lacking adequate drug coverage and you walk out of your doctor’s office with a prescription for medication to treat your diabetes or high blood pressure or infection or depression, you may be on your own. If you require therapy with a psychologist for anxiety, or physiotherapy for your sports injury, or a root canal, your access will depend on your ability to pay. THE COST OF CUTTING CORNERS Debates about expanding our public health care plans to include medications, mental health care, home care, and a host of other medical services—and to move beyond treatment into true prevention—are as old as the plans themselves. Out-of-pocket health care spending (what you reach into your wallet to pay for, whether the full cost of a service or the co-payment or deductible) accounts for roughly 14 percent of total health care expenditures. Private insurance, often provided through our workplaces, accounts for another 12 percent. Of course, some of this is discretionary health spending (the massage you enjoy but that isn’t medically necessary, or that second pair of eyeglasses you get because they look cooler than your old ones do), but reliance on private spending and employment-dependent insurance is still higher in Canada than in most high-income nations. COVID-19 teaches us about which kinds of tragedies we go to great lengths to avoid and which we allow to persist. When one includes both public and private spending, health care amounts to 10.7 percent of our GDP, which is in the top third of OECD nations. But our government spending is actually lower than most of our comparator nations’. While 70 percent of health care spending is public in Canada, that number is 82 percent in the Netherlands, 77 percent in the UK, and 79 percent in New Zealand. Each of those countries’ universal health care systems includes both coverage of prescription medications with just nominal user fees and some degree of mental health care. Canada has long had the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world with universal health care that doesn’t include prescription drugs. We also have less public coverage of home care, dental care, and non-physician care outside hospitals—which includes services provided by everyone from social workers to psychologists and physiotherapists—than most comparator nations. For example, New Zealand’s publicly funded system includes long-term care, mental health care, physical therapy, and prescription drugs in addition to hospital and physician care. In Germany, mental health care, dental care, optometry, and prescription drugs are all covered by mandatory universal health insurance. While some public coverage for these services exists for some people in Canada, the amount differs by province and territory, and many people fall through the cracks. The result is that, in our purportedly universal system, many Canadians go without necessary services if they don’t have private insurance coverage, usually through their employers. And Douglas’s vision of a social democratic society that would take the broadest approach to alleviating the root causes of ill health—which include poverty, racism, and lack of education—has not dominated the political discourse for generations. Canada has moved so slowly on the journey to expand and improve medicare that it has been accused of a “paradigm freeze”—stuck in a system just good enough to prevent any major change or improvement from ever occurring. Indeed, current interest in COVID-19 treatments offers up a potential irony for Canada. If the efforts of the international research community yield a treatment—a tablet or liquid that could be taken to prevent hospitalization or a ventilator—millions among us would have no coverage for it. “During the H1N1 influenza, [several provincial governments] announced that the antiviral medication Tamiflu would be available free of cost to anyone who needed it,” says Irfan Dhalla, a vice-president at Unity Health Toronto and a practising physician at St. Michael’s Hospital. “A similar approach might occur should a COVID-19 treatment become available. However, this equitable approach [raises] the question: Why should one prescription medication be available to all based on need and not others?” In June 2019, then minister of health Ginette Petitpas Taylor tabled the final report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare. The report provided a blueprint for the stepwise implementation of a pharmacare program, developed in partnership with provinces and territories. In the context of a global pandemic, that partially shelved blueprint needs to be dusted off in a hurry. If prescription drug coverage is one urgent and obvious area of expansion, mental health care is another. In 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada found that 2.5 percent of respondents described having suicidal thoughts within the previous year. By May 2020, in the thick of the pandemic’s first wave, a survey found that number had more than doubled. Over and above the disruption experienced by all Canadians when the economy shut down, some people—including parents, people with preexisting mental illnesses, Indigenous people, those with a disability, and those who identify as LGBTQ—faced an increased risk of serious mental illness and suicide. This is the curve after the curve: the increasing mental health toll of economic devastation, social isolation, and mounting uncertainty that follows on the heels of our commendable collective efforts to squelch the spread of COVID-19. On average, about 4,000 people in Canada die by suicide each year. A recent study suggested that, as a consequence of COVID-19’s impact on employment alone, that number could go up by more than 25 percent in both 2020 and 2021. By comparison, in the first ten months of 2020, just over 10,000 people had died in Canada as a result of the disease itself. “After a disaster, population rates of psychological distress tend to double or triple,” the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported in July. Proposals for health care reform date back to long before the pandemic, but it took the pandemic to get action on implementing even some of them. Expanding publicly funded pharmacare and mental health care—moving closer to the promise of “universal” care—could be achieved through a variety of means, the easiest of which is generally understood to be a transfer of federal dollars to the provinces and territories to support part of the cost of such services, on the condition that they be provided free of charge to everyone already eligible for general health coverage. In other words, it would look exactly like medicare does right now, and your health card would be all you need. Canadians are already paying for these services, whether indirectly, by financing their workplace or private insurance coverage, or directly, by paying out of pocket for them. Each year, Canadians spend almost a billion dollars on mental health counselling, with 30 percent of that coming out of pocket. In the case of prescription drugs, we pay among the highest prices in the world because we don’t negotiate centrally. The report on the implementation of pharmacare put the price tag at $3.5 billion to launch a national program in 2022, with savings of $350 per year for the average family. We are also collectively, out of the public purse, currently paying the downstream costs of having a segment of the population that can’t afford such services and is forced to suffer the consequences. Removing out-of-pocket costs for medications used to treat diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory conditions alone would result in 220,000 fewer emergency-room visits and 90,000 fewer hospital stays annually, that same pharmacare report found. This would yield $1.2 billion a year in health care savings, just for those three common diseases. Similar results exist for mental health services. A 2017 study found that every dollar spent on publicly funded psychological services for depression would save Canada’s health system two dollars. Treating health conditions before they escalate and require hospital care improves medical outcomes, preserves quality of life, and saves money that could help offset the costs of program expansion. UNIVERSAL FOR WHOM? In the first wave of the pandemic, 81 percent of Canada’s COVID-19-related deaths were in long-term care (LTC) facilities. Our country was among the worst of all developed nations in preventing COVID-19 deaths in settings like the one where Eryn Dixon lived. A report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information concluded that countries with centralized regulation and organization of LTC, and those that implemented strict guidelines to prevent transmission of the virus at the same time as their lockdowns, fared best. In some parts of Canada, that didn’t happen until it was well past too late. Though some nonprofits fared badly and some for-profits did well, on average, the problem was worse in for-profit facilities, which had larger and more deadly COVID-19 outbreaks than their nonprofit counterparts did. The resulting headlines were scathing: “Majority of region’s long-term care deaths occurred in for-profit homes”; “Four out of five COVID-19 deaths have been linked to seniors’ homes. That says a lot about how Canada regards its elders.” Well over 200,000 Canadians live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. You know them; so do we. They are our parents living with dementia and frailty. Disproportionately, they are our mothers and grandmothers, the matriarchs of our families. On average, they are over eighty-five and face multiple health challenges, from chronic lung and heart disease to mobility issues to memory loss. Many Canadians are placed in LTC sooner than they and their families would like—and prematurely exposed to the accompanying risks of living in a congregate setting—because they cannot access the supports and services they need at home or in their communities. And, no matter when a loved one is moved to such a facility, we should be able to expect some consistency in the quality of care they will receive. But, for many years in Canada, quality-of-care indicators, like worsening symptoms of depression or increasing pain, have varied significantly between homes, and worse outcomes have long been documented in for-profit settings in both Ontario and BC, including a higher risk of death. This is at least in part because staffing levels tend to be lower in for-profit facilities. In addition, personal support workers (PSWs), nurses, and other LTC staff are among the lowest-paid and most insecure workers in our health care systems. Many fell ill with COVID-19 themselves and, in some tragic cases, unknowingly transmitted the virus across facilities where they worked multiple part-time jobs. COVID-19 “gives us an opportunity to reimagine LTC,” says Margaret McGregor, a family physician and a clinical associate professor at UBC medical school. “It’s time to change the staffing model in LTC so that PSW ratios of one worker to ten to fifteen residents are reduced to one worker to four to seven residents. This allows staff the time to provide holistic relational care. Much like daycare, these ratios should be funded, mandated, and enforced. More importantly, there is evidence that relational care, allowing staff the time to both care for and get to know their residents, improves seniors’ quality of life while improving PSWs’ conditions of work.” An even more uncomfortable truth: health outcomes in Canada are very contingent on who we are and where we live. Race and class figure heavily in the COVID-19 story because they figure heavily in all health outcomes in Canada. Neighbourhoods in Toronto with the lowest incomes, highest rates of unemployment, and highest concentrations of newcomers consistently had twice the number of COVID-19 cases and more than twice the rate of hospital admissions than those at the top end of Toronto’s income spectrum did. People experiencing homelessness, seasonal agricultural workers, and those living in congregate settings (everything from rooming houses to prisons) were suddenly acutely aware that their proximity to others put them directly in harm’s way. “Our initial response was focused on flattening the curve, not who was under the curve,” says Kwame McKenzie, an expert on the social causes of illness and the CEO of the Wellesley Institute. “But what is really worrying about these analyses is that they were predictable.” As of mid-September, the rate of those testing positive was 79 people per 100,000 for the white population. It was nearly seven times that for Black residents (547 per 100,000) and more than eight times that for Latin American Torontonians (643 per 100,000). We’ve long known that race, newcomer status, and income drive health outcomes. For example, Canadians of South Asian origin are three times more likely than the rest of the Canadian population is to develop type-two diabetes, and they have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. We also know that not everyone accesses health care services equitably. Research from Ontario and BC shows that women who are new to Canada are less likely to have their breast cancer captured through screening, and wait longer to be diagnosed, compared with Canadian-born women. First Nations people in BC have well documented but poorly understood increased incidence and decreased survival for colorectal cancer compared with the rest of British Columbians. But there is still so much we don’t know when it comes to how racism and bias affect both health and health care: most provinces and territories do not collect data about Indigeneity, race, or ethnicity in the health care system, so we lack the evidence we need to improve health equity. One crucial example: the COVID-19 rates of the 56 percent of First Nations people who live off-reserve are reflected only in the general-population statistics. Urban communities are not the only ones left behind: as the second wave of the pandemic crests in many parts of the country, rural and Northern communities have struggled and will continue to struggle to access COVID-19 care, as they face challenges to access health care at all times. The concern about access to specialists and critical-care resources such as ventilators is of course most pronounced in such locations, where sometimes there are simply none within hundreds of kilometres. Prior to the pandemic, First Nations people, Métis people, and Inuit living in rural and remote areas already faced long waitlists for specialist care and a shortage of available health practitioners, often delaying diagnoses and disrupting continuity of care. The distrust Indigenous peoples have in our health care system is informed by historical experiences in residential schools, Indian hospitals, and tuberculosis sanatoriums; it continues to be eroded by present-day racism. Hospital protocols limiting or eliminating family visits, while understandable efforts to reduce rates of COVID-19, may have perpetuated barriers for Indigenous people, many of whom feel unsafe when alone in health care institutions because of our country’s history and ongoing discrimination. One needs only to watch the video of Joyce Echaquan’s final moments to understand why. COVID-19 has exacerbated wait times for all Canadians, but where access was already poor or nonexistent, the burden is heaviest. Five years ago, Canada accepted the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report; in 2016, the country became a full supporter, without qualification, of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Despite these steps, disparities in the health and wellness of Indigenous people in Canada compared with that of non-Indigenous Canadians persist and, in some ways, are worsening. Poverty, crowded housing, unemployment, decreases to both quantity and quality of educational opportunities, struggles for food security, and diminished access to Indigenous languages, cultures, and traditional, unceded land—and the deep resilience and capacity that persist despite these impacts of colonization—all determine wellness and downstream health outcomes. Layered on top of these are the all-too-familiar elevated rates of trauma, suicide, addiction, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, and cancers—the root causes of which are all embedded in historical and current government policies. But let’s take a closer look. First Nations individuals living on reserves were thought to be sitting ducks for a COVID-19 outbreak: many reserves are located in rural, remote, and Northern areas, have decreased access to culturally safe medical care, and have minimal or no local access to the type of medical care acute COVID-19 patients may need. Yet these “high risk” communities did not fare as predicted in the first wave. Indeed, the percentage of First Nations individuals living on reserve who reported positive for COVID-19 by the end of July was one-quarter that of the general population, and the fatality rate only one-fifth. So far, Inuit communities have been largely spared from the pandemic as well. How? Many First Nations across the country closed their communities to outsiders in wave one by exercising sovereignty over their land and self-governance. Also key: the respect and priority naturally evident in First Nations communities for their Elders and knowledge holders, and their cultural reliance on the land. First Nations’ connection to the land has always been a vital part of their resilience as they protected the food sources, waterways, and traditional medicines that nourish their holistic health and well-being. For those who are often outdoors and in remote areas, physical distancing is a natural way of life. Is the rest of Canada capable of absorbing the lessons from Indigenous peoples and these practices? Perhaps we should. Despite these better-than-feared outcomes, COVID-19 has taken its toll on Indigenous people in other ways. Take the opioid crisis in BC. In April 2016, the province’s medical health officer declared a public health emergency due to the rising number of overdoses and deaths. BC’s First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) released data in July demonstrating a tragic exacerbation of this crisis within BC First Nations during COVID-19. First Nations overdose deaths increased by 93 percent in the first five months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and the percentage of First Nations people in the overall total of overdose deaths rose from 9.9 percent to 16 percent. (In BC, First Nations people constitute 3.3 percent of the population.) The FNHA postulates several explanations: an increase in drug use occurring when individuals were alone due to physical distancing, decreased access to and utilization of health care services, and increased toxicity of drugs as supply chains constricted during the pandemic. And the response to this crisis is markedly different. “When it comes to COVID,” Nel Wieman, the organization’s acting deputy chief medical officer, says, “the slogan essentially became, ‘We’re all in this together.’ And, when it comes to people who use substances, the thinking is, ‘I’m glad it’s you and not me.’” Whether one is talking about newcomers in the urban core of our largest cities or Indigenous people on reserve, the interplay between health and social factors is complex. Sometimes, a COVID-19 death is a death by overdose, or by suicide, rather than by a virus; we may come to see more kinds of COVID-19 deaths before the pandemic is over. BREAKING THE LOGJAM That we are in the midst of an opioid crisis is not news. Nor is it news that the staff at long-term care facilities are underpaid, or that there are too few of them. It isn’t news that pharmacare is long overdue, or that wait times are too long, or that even a universal public health care system leaves vulnerable populations behind. The real news is that we can do something about all these things. The opioid crisis in BC has persisted for years, yet the province flattened its first COVID-19 curve in four months. What COVID-19 has shown us is that, in the face of a terrifying possibility—mass death, an overwhelmed health care system—the excuses we use to justify the status quo dissolve, and profound change can happen much more quickly than we are used to imagining. Some of the logjams in both our services and our thinking have been broken. Early this year, even as hospitals were creating new critical-care wards and training their staff in the donning and doffing of PPE, other transformations were afoot. When Lindsey Longstaff’s seven-year-old son stepped on a nail this spring, she decided to try virtual care for the first time. Longstaff has severe asthma, and the nearest emergency department is in Regina, a forty-minute drive away, so she wanted to avoid a trip. After downloading a virtual-care app, Longstaff had an assessment with a nurse, sent photos of her son’s wound, and got a call from a doctor shortly afterward. She was told he didn’t need stitches and was shown how to clean and dress his wound herself—all of which was an exciting enough development in the speed and convenience of health care delivery that it got covered by CTV. Before COVID-19, virtual care seemed a long way off in Canada. In 2018, only 8 percent of Canadians reported having had a virtual visit with their health care provider. Today, many providers and hospitals rely on virtual care to check in with patients and monitor their conditions. In one survey, more than half of respondents said their most recent health encounters, in April, May, and June 2020, were virtual. The overnight adoption of billing codes for physicians doing virtual care, allowing us to be paid for providing these online and phone services just as we are for in-person visits, was game changing. Assuming those billing codes are here to stay, many of us will never go back to a time when a patient needed to come in person for a simple issue that could just as easily and safely be dealt with virtually. Canadians often assume that shortening our long wait times and expanding publicly funded services must involve more money, more hospitals, more operating-room time and more specialists. Of course, sometimes more resources are needed. But reorganizing and redeploying what we already have will get us pretty far. A rich literature exists on how to fix wait times in Canada. Interprofessional teams, which include skilled providers like nurses, pharmacists, and physiotherapists, reduce reliance on doctors, who are often the bottlenecks when it comes to health care waits. Single-entry models—in which patients are given the next available appointment with any qualified specialist in their region rather than waiting for a particular specialist—improve flow by using a single, common wait-list for a given procedure. Reducing demand is also important: scaling back on low-value tests and procedures is difficult to do, but the potential benefits are extremely high. Both patients and doctors tend to believe that providing more services, in the way of tests, treatments, and procedures, will result in better health outcomes, but often that isn’t the case. When it comes to interventions, more isn’t always better. Strengthening primary care and home care so that most care occurs with a provider who knows you well and is easily accessible is key to eliminating waits for specialists. And, in this day and age, the use of technology, like the kind used by Longstaff and her son, holds enormous potential. All of these have appeared in proposals and articles that date back to long before the pandemic, but it took the pandemic to get action on implementing even some of them. “For years,” says Chris Simpson, a cardiologist and former president of the Canadian Medical Association, “doctors have paid less attention to the unwanted clinical-practice variation that exists out there in the real world. Why do patients in one region get these tests and procedures at higher rates than other regions? The pandemic-induced slowdown . . . gives us an opportunity to look hard at our waiting lists. A hard look at appropriateness. A hard look at alternatives to surgical and procedural care, where appropriate. And a hard look at the huge clinical-practice variation in diagnostic testing. It’s an opportunity to improve the quality of the care we receive, to reduce low-value care, to enhance equity, and to use our resources in a wise and prudent way.” But, perhaps surprisingly, the experiment that may have had the biggest impact on health during COVID-19 didn’t take place in the health care system at all. Virtually overnight, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy stabilized the incomes of hundreds of thousands of Canadians; other emergency measures prevented residents from losing their housing. This is income support for the twenty-first century: easier to apply for, quicker to access and set up, structured not just to replace income but to supplement it. If we made programs like this permanent, reconfiguring them into a form of guaranteed annual income, the health benefits could be profound. Much more than by MRI machines or surgery, health is fostered when kids grow up in safe households, with nutritious food on the table and access to education, in a climate free of fear and trauma. “When public health measures closed down large tracts of the economy in response to COVID-19, we had a system up and running in a matter of weeks that didn’t require mountains of paperwork or intrusive ‘means testing,’” says Evelyn Forget, an economist in the department of community health sciences at the University of Manitoba. “All that was required, it seems, was a change in attitude. COVID-19 showed us that we can break through what we thought were hard limits on our ability to deliver income security.” This matters to doctors like us because financial stability is an even stronger influence on health than access to health services is: it’s social determinants of health, like income, education, and housing, that are far more influential. Between 1993 and 2014, in Ontario, residents of the poorest areas were more than twice as likely to die from a preventable cause than those living in the wealthier neighbourhoods were. People in the lowest income group are also less likely to receive health care when they need it and are 50 percent less likely than those in the highest income group are to see a specialist or receive care in the evenings or during the weekend. As the Canadian Medical Association has pointed out, there are hundreds of studies confirming that people in the lowest socioeconomic groups carry the greatest burden of disease. As a result, the CMA (among other bodies) has called for policy action to improve the social and economic circumstances of all Canadians. In time, we may learn that the CERB, widely viewed as an economic program, was the most important health program of the pandemic. Every night, for the period of time when the nation was most intensely gripped with preventing the virus’s spread, people would come out onto their balconies and porches to clap and cheer, banging pots and pans as a way of thanking health care providers and other essential workers for their contributions to keeping people safe. Of course, we were glad to see those contributions celebrated in this way, and we are proud of our work and the work of our colleagues and friends at the front lines of health care. But we couldn’t help but feel that those of us who work in health care should be the ones saying thank you. The extent to which Canada has so far avoided the worst-case scenario, sparing us from having to work in untenable and terrifying circumstances, is only because of the actions taken by the public. Physical distancing. Staying home. Socializing on Zoom. Wearing masks. Forgoing restaurants, movie theatres, visits to the gym, hugs with loved ones, birthday parties, long-planned trips. Scraping by without work. Working from home. Living on less. Home-schooling kids. Staying away from the bedsides of loved ones in the hospital. All this, and more, was done by each of us and all of us. Perhaps the biggest news of the pandemic is that people who normally do not see themselves as powerful are exactly that. Whether Canadians feel it or not, we have proven that we have the power to protect and enhance the health of our communities. That engagement, that willingness to pitch in to protect others, is what can now be harnessed in subsequent waves, in the recovery, and in the future we will build together. What remains to be seen is whether that power will indeed be harnessed. In the 1964 report that formed the blueprint for national medicare policy, justice Emmett Hall recommended that medications be included in Canada’s public health care plans so that people would not have to depend on their employers to ensure treatment. Recommendations to increase accountability and quality in long-term care date back to the 1966 Final Report of the Special Senate Committee on Aging in Canada. In 1974, Marc Lalonde, then minister of national health and welfare, issued a report called A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, in which he recommended that public health interventions should focus their attention on people with the highest risk of exposure to disease, such as those living in poverty. And, in 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report called on the government, “in consultation with Aboriginal peoples, to . . . close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities.” The problem isn’t that we don’t have a plan. In 2018, The Lancet published a special issue on Canadian health care. One of the two central papers (which we were privileged to co-author with a diverse group of researchers from across Canada) argued that this country needs a renewed social contract. “Universal health coverage is an aspiration, not a destination,” we wrote. Since then, the fallout from COVID-19 has served to further unmask the gaps in our health care that have long been written about by scholars across the country. It’s well past time to expand the core basket of medicare services to include pharmacare, mental health care, and other medical services we currently ignore, and to reimagine how health services are delivered in order to eliminate wait times for non-emergency services. To design progressive home-care services and smaller home-style institutions that could provide older people with the dignified care they deserve. To address suicide, mental health, addictions, chronic diseases, life expectancy, and the availability of health services within Indigenous communities. To treat the biggest causes of ill health—the ones that are rooted in social and economic inequity—instead of only the ones we find easy to identify under microscopes and in operating rooms. The familiar refrain for many followers of health and social reforms in Canada has been that we know what we need to do, we just need to do it. Now, through force of circumstance and perhaps without meaning to, we have finally begun the work. A terrifying glimpse of our own vulnerability has broken the logjam of health system reform, of income stabilization reform, of public and citizen engagement in health. Maybe this pandemic can mark a shift from wishful thinking to responsibility—from aspiration to expectation about what we actually mean and what we actually deliver when we say, so proudly, that our health care system is “universal.” We used to talk about whether big change would ever be possible. Now we know it is. The O’Hagan Essay on Public Affairs is an annual research-based examination of the current economic, social, and political realities of Canada.

This money would add to the $40 million allocated to building a series of roads across the Nunavut–Northwest Territories border, which will help connect Izok Lake to the deepwater port at Nunavut’s Grays Bay, located along the increasingly ice-free Northwest Passage sea route that leads to Asia. In 2011, MMG Limited, a multinational mining corporation, expressed interest in building a road to open up some of the Arctic’s remote but lucrative mineral reserves. Standing to benefit most from this would be the corporation’s primary shareholder: the Chinese government. The tremendous cost of the road and port, however, ultimately made the project economically unviable for MMG, which halted further development, in 2013, in hopes that Canada would pick up the shovel. “On behalf of MMG, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Canadian government for their support and funding,” CEO Geoffrey Gao said in a press release following Garneau’s pledge. “Road and port access is the key to unlocking the Izok Corridor.” For Stanley Anablak, president of the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, an organization that represents Inuit in western Nunavut, it mattered not whether investment came from Canada or from abroad. Investment had been held back largely by limited backbone infrastructure in the territories. More roads and ports, better broadband networks and transmission lines, and even railways, Anablak notes, could change that. “Without this project, we will continue to be dependent on the [few] mines that can operate completely independent of regional infrastructure,” he wrote in an email. “We want to be more self sufficient. We need to be in charge of our own destiny.” With the entire transportation network project bearing a $1.6 billion price tag, the $61.5 million in Canadian funding seemed a drop in the bucket, but it is what that money represents that concerns Michael Byers, a Canada Research Chair in global politics and international law at the University of British Columbia who has monitored the development for years. “I don’t see a need for us to be subsidizing Chinese investments in the Canadian Arctic,” he says. He believes economic benefits to Inuit communities are oversold. “[The road] has one purpose, which is to support mineral development in the region . . . and the primary commercial beneficiary will be a Chinese company.” There is growing concern that China’s influence in the North could threaten Canada’s autonomy in the region and put politicians in uncomfortable situations as they weigh national regulations with foreign-policy strategies. Canada has spent decades ignoring its Arctic potential and, as a result, the region’s economy lags far behind that of most other northern regions around the world. Evidently, the Canadian Arctic has not proved such a blind spot for China. The New Road in the North Can We Repair Canada’s Trade Relationship with China? Who Controls Canada’s Arctic? China’s growing interest in the Canadian Arctic, one of the least defended regions on earth, has been a calculated move. In 2013, despite not being one of the eight Arctic nations, China gained official observer status at the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum, and later declared itself a “near-Arctic state”—a phrase that seems to ignore the 5,000 kilometres between its northernmost point and the Arctic Circle. The Chinese government has focused largely on the Russian and European Arctic, but in its scramble for resources and transportation domination, that is beginning to change. In Greenland, for example, as the ice sheet recedes, precious metals, gemstones, rare earth elements, and uranium are suddenly becoming accessible. China now controls over 90 percent of the global trade of rare earth minerals, according to a report from the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, and a Chinese company is forging ahead with a mine at the world’s second-largest rare earth element deposit, in Greenland. “A big reason the Canadian North trails the Russian Arctic, and even Greenland, in resource extraction and development is that it’s just so hard to get in there, build things, and get the product out to market,” explains Adam Lajeunesse, a researcher in Canadian Arctic marine-security policy at St. Francis Xavier University. Forty percent of Canada lies in the Arctic—an area with abundant deposits of oil, gas, and minerals. And Chinese companies have already helped finance the Nunavik nickel mine and Lac Otelnuk iron project in the sub-Arctic of northern Quebec. Lajeunesse says that Chinese investment in the Arctic is something he’s been anticipating. And the country’s advance toward the Arctic Circle will likely be aided by warming temperatures. In 2017, the icebreaker Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, made its first voyage through the Northwest Passage, which Canada recognizes as internal waters. The United States has long contested Canada’s sovereignty here, but as Lajeunesse explains, “China’s position on the Northwest Passage is purposefully ambiguous.” And, while the Chinese government has said it respects Canadian sovereignty in the region, it plans to freely use the transit passages. Arguing against Canadian sovereignty, Lajeunesse says, would make operating in the Canadian North more difficult; this way, China reserves the right to challenge Canada’s claim during future diplomatic negotiations. Given the dangers of operating in undercharted waters, foreign nations must rely on the support of the Canadian Coast Guard to ensure safe shipping.Sea ice, storms, and icebergs could all spell disaster. China is already a key supporter of the Northern Sea Route, the once frozen shipping lane opening up above Russia that’s expected to shave as much as two weeks off transit times between Europe and Asia. And, at the mouth of the Yangtze River in Shanghai’s Jiangnan Shipyard, Chinese and Finnish architects recently finished construction on the nation’s second heavy icebreaker. Closing bids for a third, China will soon have more heavy icebreakers than most of the actual Arctic nations. In 2018, the country released its first Arctic policy paper, laying out plans for a “Polar Silk Road”—an Arctic extension of its in famous transportation megaproject, the Belt and Road Initiative, which currently spans more than 130 countries. The paper focused on China’s altruistic aims: the Chinese government hoped to understand the Arctic through research, protect it against climate change, and promote peace. But the paper also stated plans to extract resources and participate in the Arctic’s governance. Where does that leave Canada, the nation with the second-largest share of the Arctic, behind Russia? “Some Chinese academics talk about the Arctic region as possibly the second Middle East.” The Canadian government has been slow to wake up to China’s Arctic ambitions. “We’ve not been paying attention, both defensively and opportunistically, to the Arctic,” says Irvin Studin, president of the Institute for 21st Century Questions. Rather, we’ve focused solely on relations with our neighbouring global powerhouse. It wasn’t until April 2019 that the House of Commons updated its report on Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, which recommended that the country “should engage with the Government of China to understand their growing interest in the Arctic.” Engaging with China, however, has proved difficult. With the 2018 arrest and attempted extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, whatever goodwill existed between the two countries vanished. Soon afterward, China detained two Canadians, including a diplomat. (China denies this was retaliation.) Despite a tense moment in the history of China–Canada relations, Byers says there is zero potential for militarized conflict with China in Canada’s North. Rather, China’s Arctic interests will take the form of strategic investment and acquisitions. In 2013, China acquired Nexen, a Calgary-based oil-and-gas company, in a $15.1 billion deal that essentially transferred a portion of Alberta’s oil-sands wealth to China. “China is very good at diversifying,” says Petra Dolata, a former University of Calgary Canada Research Chair in the history of energy. “Some Chinese academics talk about the Arctic region as possibly the second Middle East.” Currently, there’s no offshore oil-and-gas drilling in the Canadian Arctic: a five year moratorium between the US and Canada blocked the issuance of any new licences in the Arctic Ocean. But that agreement is up for review in 2021. In the interim, China is focusing on its mining portfolio. This May, the country entered a bid to purchase struggling mining company TMAC Resources, which operates the Doris North gold mine, in Hope Bay, Nunavut. The company’s shareholders later voted in favour of the company’s sale to Shandong Gold Mining, a state owned enterprise and the second-largest gold-mining company in China. This upset Yellowknife North MLA Rylund Johnson. “China is writing the cheques now and the government of Canada is not,” he says. “Canada is not willing to give Indigenous people in the North enough money to survive. They’re not willing to build the necessary infrastructure. When China shows up, people here don’t have a choice. . . . We’re losing out on Arctic sovereignty.” He’s fearful of a future when the Canadian government has to regulate foreign-owned enterprises or dole out punishments following an industrial disaster in the Arctic. “I don’t want to have to pass laws thinking, ‘Is this going to anger the Chinese government?’” (After this article went to print, Canada rejected the sale of TMAC Resources, a Canadian mining company, to Chinese state-owned Shandong Gold Mining, citing national security concerns.) China’s emergence as a major player in the Canadian Arctic doesn’t alarm everyone. Speaking at a 2019 conference on Arctic affairs, then Northwest Territories premier Bob McLeod addressed the room: “Iqaluit to Oslo is 3,900 kilometres, compared to almost 6,000 from Toronto. And a 10,500 kilometre flight from Toronto to Beijing would be reduced to 6,600 kilometres from Inuvik.” The message was clear: Canada’s North was far more aligned with certain major global trading blocs than the rest of the country was. China was an opportunity, not a threat. Indeed, many see China’s interest as a pathway for Indigenous people in the North to gain more control over their economic futures. “If you are serious about Indigenous agency,” says the University of Calgary’s Dolata, “then some of those communities will say, ‘If the Chinese want to work with us, bring infrastructure here, we will happily do this.’” It has happened in Greenland, where Inuit groups have aligned themselves with Chinese investors instead of with Copenhagen. Now, it’s happening across Canada’s Arctic regions. “The Kitikmeot region has enjoyed a reputation of being open to business,” Kitikmeot Inuit Association president Stanley Anablak notes. “But being open does not mean being naive or soft.” Any Arctic investor, he explains, must ad here to not only Canada’s and Nunavut’s laws but also Inuit protections of the land. “The Kitikmeot regions compete with many other international mining districts for this investment. We are open to receiving investment whether it is from Canadian or foreign companies.” Though the prime minister’s attention may be focused elsewhere, northern actors have been paying close attention to Chinese developments in the Arctic and weighing how they might realize the region’s economic potential. “We have two new borders this century,” says Irvin Studin. “One is the Arctic border that’s melting. And we have a western border with China. For over 150 years of Canadian existence, China was a destabilized former empire. Now, it’s got its act together.” Gloria Dickie Gloria Dickie has written for the New York Times, National Geographic, The Atlantic, and the Guardian.

As COVID-19 case numbers surge, we’re seeing the consequences January 26, 2021January 28, 2021 - by Gabrielle DroletGabrielle Drolet Illustration by Natalie Vineberg, Updated 12:14, Jan. 28, 2021 | Published 15:05, Jan. 26, 2021 The morning shift was always the worst. It was the summer after grade ten, I was sixteen, and I’d just been hired at Tim Hortons. I’d wake at 5 a.m. and put on pots of coffee while it was still dark out. The customers would start arriving about an hour later, many of them regulars with the same coffee-and-bagel order. One might think this repetition would build a rapport. That usually wasn’t the case. Customers would interrupt my “good morning” to demand breakfast. Some blamed me for the rising costs of coffee and doughnuts, as though I could ever be responsible for what went on at head office. Others rolled their eyes or raised their voices when I took too long to count their change, the coffee wasn’t as fresh as they liked, or we were out of an item they wanted. But, no matter what, my coworkers and I were expected to offer service with a smile. Everywhere I’ve worked since then—Gap, a used bookstore, independently owned coffee shops—the story’s been the same. At the bigger corporations, the importance of the customer experience was taught in training and repeated on the ground: when someone is rude, you handle it without complaining. At the smaller companies, even if the expectation wasn’t made explicit, it was still a part of the culture. The Fight to Save Public Transit How Universal Basic Income Will Save the Economy The Case for Affordable Child Care This past summer would be different, I told myself. In a global pandemic, customers would be more grateful toward workers putting themselves at risk, right? Wrong. I spent June and July working at a winery in Prince Edward County. In the past few years, the island has established itself as a getaway for Torontonians, and the influx persisted this summer. When we opened for wine tastings in June, the majority of our customers joked that they were “escaping” Toronto, a city that was still largely closed due to its high number of COVID-19 cases. With a population of roughly 25,000, Prince Edward County has only one hospital. There was a small part of me that understood people’s need for a vacation—living in a city with little green space must be hard, and a beach getaway is undoubtedly appealing. But they were putting an entire community at risk. What’s more, they weren’t very nice about it. Pouring Chardonnay for Rolex-wearing customers who don’t say please or thank you—or tip—is already tiresome. Doing so while wearing a mask, sanitizing your surroundings every few minutes, and knowing that you’re putting your health on the line is crushing. Customers frequently ignored COVID-19 restrictions, complaining about having to wear a mask or maintain physical distance. I was grateful for the job, but by the end of a workday, I was so drained that all I could do was curl up in bed. Across North America, we’re seeing the consequences of behaviour like this. COVID-19 outbreaks keep occurring at customer-facing businesses, and case numbers are surging as a result. Although Canada does provide a federal COVID-19 sickness benefit, it is inaccessible or inadequate for many essential workers, who are exposed to workplace outbreaks at higher rates—the list of affected businesses has grown to include restaurants, fast-food chains, and big-box stores. The belief that employees should keep their heads down and do what they’re told—even if it involves being mistreated by customers—is a problem that existed long before the pandemic. The customer-service industry is built on emotional labour, a culture in which employees are expected to smile and be kind no matter the cost. Most customer-service employees likely don’t have the financial stability to leave a job because of unsafe conditions or for their mental health. Speaking up may mean getting fired—and, during a recession, the stakes of losing work are even higher. Most service employees likely have a horror story of an especially egregious customer interaction that pushed them to the edge. When something like that happens, employees are still expected to show up for work the next day like it was nothing. Today, the expectations are the same, but the consequences can be devastating. The phrase “the customer is always right” was popularized by Harry Gordon Selfridge, Marshal Field, and John Wanamaker, a trio of businessmen who had established their department stores by the early 1900s. At the time, theirs was a radical idea: business owners had never considered that the success of their stores depended on the happiness of their customers. Customers had to be satisfied, treated kindly, and reassured that they were right—even if they weren’t—because such treatment helped boost the store’s reputation. Over a century later, the idea is a mainstay of customer service, even creeping into contexts it was never intended for, like fast-food restaurants and spas. Moreover, it’s being used to justify increasingly ludicrous demands. The phrase no longer just means “be hospitable toward customers”—it now means “be hospitable toward customers no matter the cost.” In March, when COVID-19 led to shutdowns and calls to stay home, there was a sudden shift in this attitude. People who were able to stay home began using words like hero to describe those who pumped gas and sold groceries. They put up lawn signs that read “THANK YOU, ESSENTIAL WORKERS!” But the gratitude didn’t last long. Driving through Prince Edward County, I noticed that lawn signs were gradually being taken down. On Twitter, conversations about essential workers seemed to fizzle out. When governments started to reopen nonessential businesses, going out to stores and restaurants was no longer a luxury—which meant less pressure to regard employees as special or worthy of praise. The term emotional labour has grown popular in the past few years. Conversations surrounding it spiked in 2017, following Gemma Hartley’s viral Harper’s Bazaar article about housework. Hartley’s piece reflected the dominant use of emotional labour at the time—a staple of white, heteronormative feminist discourse, often used to refer to the extra domestic work performed by women in straight relationships; as Hartley put it, emotional labour was “the job men still don’t understand.” But the term, coined by sociologist Arlie Hochschild in the 1980s, originally referred to the work of suppressing an emotion, which certain jobs demanded. In a field like customer service, emotional labour is constant—and it takes a hefty toll. Michael Daniels, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business who specializes in workplace leadership and emotions, explains that it’s easiest to fake an emotion when it’s close to how you’re actually feeling. If you walk into work in a good mood, it’s less taxing to smile at impatient customers and tell them to have a nice day. But, with COVID-19, employees are facing a higher base level of stress: they have to sanitize everything; they have to enforce mask-wearing policies; and, like everyone else, they have to deal with the day-to-day anxiety that accompanies living in a pandemic. Accordingly, customers are more stressed than usual too. “You have both sides of this equation amped up a little bit,” Daniels says. Since everyone is more on-edge overall, he thinks it’s likely that customers become more hostile and take it out on minimum-wage workers. The scene Daniels describes, in which customers are increasingly frustrated and employees increasingly exhausted, seems to have become the norm in many workplaces. While customer-service jobs have always been emotionally taxing, workers across sectors, facing increased harassment and poor treatment by customers, report that the past year has been worse by far. A dealer at an Ohio casino says she’s expected to maintain the Midwestern hospitality her region is known for, treating guests “like family” even if they put her in danger by refusing to follow COVID-19 protocols. She’s been instructed to “smile with her eyes” (her face is covered by a mask) and be bubbly toward customers, and she has been explicitly told not to get into arguments with them. This last part is especially difficult—she says she hears a customer express an anti-mask sentiment at least once every shift and often deals with conspiracy theorists who openly believe the coronavirus is a hoax. For the sake of her job and the tips she relies on, she has to bite her tongue. In fourteen years as a customer-service employee, she says this is the most tired she’s ever been. Employees have also seen an uptick in customer complaints. A barista at a Quebec Starbucks explains that this increased irritability is especially frustrating when you’re providing a nonessential service: people can make coffee at home; paying someone else to do it for you is a luxury. Julia Mountenay, an employee at a hardware store in Nova Scotia, has noticed a similar pattern. She says it’s become common for sudden altercations to break out in the store. Employees aren’t supposed to ask customers to wear masks, but customers will often remind one another, which can create tense situations. Other customers are erring on the side of extreme caution, not even wanting their items touched by employees. As a cashier dealing with this range of moods, Mountenay has to make a greater effort than usual to stay calm and friendly at work. “I feel like I have to change my personality for every customer,” she says. No matter the customer’s opinions, she’s never in a position to disagree with them. In some cases, it’s no easier for management, who feel responsible for keeping their employees safe while also making sure their workplaces run smoothly. Though these workers have vastly different jobs, they’re describing a similar phenomenon: long shifts of smiling at unreasonable customers has an outsize effect on their energy and well-being. The reality, of course, is that customers are often wrong. They’re wrong when they refuse to wear masks; when they raise their voices at people working through a pandemic; when they take labour for granted. When a customer fails to acknowledge the risks involved in serving them, they don’t deserve “service with a smile.” COVID-19 has made it clear that the customer-service industry needs to change. Though this has been true since well before the pandemic, the current crisis has highlighted the industry’s deep-rooted problems: the power imbalance between employees and customers; the emotional tax of these jobs; the lack of employee protections. It should go without saying, but the well-being and safety of employees should come before sales numbers. Even in mid-January, as Ontario enters a new lockdown because of a rise in cases, the province hasn’t done anything to secure paid sick leave for employees despite pleas from the public. Actions like this place low-income workers at further risk in a state of emergency. At every service job I’ve had, there were always a few customers who went out of their way to be kind, to tip, to say thank you. When I worked at the winery, these tended to be people who lived in the area and were excited about supporting a local business. They would ask about my day and how busy the place was compared to previous summers. They would buy the fancy barrel-aged bottle I recommended. And they would wish me well as they left. Maybe the pandemic will make more people appreciate just how hard customer service can be. But, for now, here’s what being a good customer should mean: doing what you can to support businesses while also helping to keep their workers safe. The kindest thing you can do for a restaurant employee is order in; the kindest thing you can do for someone working at a wine bar is buy a few bottles and skip the tasting; the kindest thing you can do for essential workers is the one that requires the least face-to-face, unmasked contact possible. Customers don’t always need to be right—they need to do the right thing. Gabrielle Drolet Gabrielle Drolet is a writer and a graduate student at the University of Guelph.

Canadian Running Magazine described MEC’s sale last September to a US private-equity firm as the “death of an ideal,” and numerous reports used language more fitting for the passing of a close relative. A “Save MEC” campaign sprang up, attracting more than 140,000 signatures as of October. In the end, none of that was enough. Postmortems started quickly, with some zeroing in on MEC’s business model. The company, founded in 1971 as Mountain Equipment Co-op, may have dropped that last word from its rebranding in 2012, but it was still technically operating as a co-operative until the sale. Unlike a conventional business, a co-operative is owned and managed by members, who set policies and make decisions. In Canada, co-operatives do everything from selling groceries (Calgary Co-op) to providing financial services (the Desjardins Group) to helping dairy farmers market their products (Gay Lea Foods). And, unlike at a conventional business, maximizing profits isn’t the primary goal. Instead, the focus is usually on building a sustainable enterprise that can provide long-term jobs. A workplace that fosters fairness and equality is something else co-ops take seriously. Profits are either reinvested in the company or returned to members. “If making money is the point of what you’re doing,” says Sonja Novkovic, the academic director of the International Centre for Co-operative Management at Saint Mary’s University, in Halifax, “then a co-op isn’t the right kind of model for you.” But is the model fatally flawed? Unfairly or not, as one of the country’s largest co-operatives—at the time of its sale, it boasted over 5 million members—MEC’s failure has raised uncomfortable questions about whether the retailer’s co-op ethic played a role in its demise. In an October op-ed, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson called MEC a “socialist regime” and alleged the company was done in by inflated wages, tolerance for inferior work, and employees kept around, in large part, because of diversity quotas. These missteps, he argued, added up to “a recipe for competitive failure.” Co-op adherents don’t buy this argument. “When a corporation goes down, nobody is asking, ‘Is the model a problem?’” Novkovic says. For her part, she puts the blame squarely on MEC’s leadership. “It’s just bad governance. That’s all there is to it.” To Novkovic’s point, what hurt MEC was a decision to transform into a more conventional corporate entity to better compete against other Canadian outdoor retailers and, especially, online giants like Amazon. In addition to changing its name in 2012, MEC added 1,400 new products and invested in splashy new headquarters. The changes, however, went deeper. In a recent piece published in The Conversation, Marc-André Pigeon, a public-policy professor at the University of Saskatchewan, argued that MEC also “built a leadership team that lacked any obvious understanding of co-operatives and fostered a culture that started to see member involvement as a problem rather than a strength.” In short, MEC was trying to cut itself loose from its co-operative identity. A consumer co-op’s biggest advantage is its refusal to play by traditional corporate rules. Co-ops not only keep more money in the communities where they are active, they create a more direct link between labour and capital that isn’t always present in privately held businesses. That link is increasingly important at a time when large corporations in Canada keep outsourcing work (and wealth) to other parts of the world. So it’s no surprise that co-ops tend to attract consumers who understand they have an inherent stake in the model’s success. But MEC appeared to forget this in its scramble to scale up. And the less consumers understood what kind of business the retailer was, the less willing they were to favour it over competitors. In other words, being a co-op wasn’t how MEC ended up losing its competitive edge—forgetting that fact was the problem. “One of the things that generally sustains a co-op is a feeling that it is a part of one’s community,” says Jon Steinman, the author of Grocery Story: The Promise of Food Co-ops in the Age of Grocery Giants. “And what can happen with a lot of co-ops, especially the ones that become more like a chain, is that those individual locations feel less like the community.” Of course, there are co-ops that have thrived without jeopardizing their connections to the communities that sustain them. One example would be Vancity, a bank that today operates dozens of branches across Metro Vancouver and BC’s south coast. But commitment to the co-op model remains a challenge for those who believe in its social and economic importance. “In every sector,” Steinman says, “co-ops consistently have the same conversation: How do we communicate, to our owners and to our customers and to politicians, what sets us apart?” MEC’s failure won’t make it any easier to tell that story effectively. How MEC Lost Touch with Its Roots Shopping Malls Might Not Be Coming Back Walmart Has Everything—Except Unions MEC was, of course, far from the only co-operative business in Canada. There are an estimated 31.8 million memberships belonging to a range of co-operatives in areas that include banking, insurance, and agriculture (a membership, it should be said, may include more than one individual). Together, the sector accounts for approximately 3 percent of Canada’s GDP and employs more people than the telecom, auto, or utilities industry. But this would be news to most Canadians. According to an October 2019 poll conducted by Abacus Research, only 10 percent of Canadians said they were “very familiar” with the co-operative business model, with another 37 percent saying they were “pretty familiar.” For example, while the Desjardins Group is the largest financial institution in Quebec, only half of the province’s residents who were polled knew it was a co-operative. What is frustrating about this lack of awareness of the nature and function of co-ops is that it’s happening at a time when Canadians are sensitive to the role that local businesses play in their communities and the risks associated with losing them. According to same Abacus Research poll, 57 percent of Canadians have what they describe as a “deep connection” to things like buying local and the need to give workers a say in how their workplace is run and a direct stake in its success—all things that the co-operative sector is well placed to respond to. “There’s great interest, especially among younger people, in these alternative forms,” says The Co-operators’ Chad Park. This renewed attention to the importance of community and local ownership isn’t the only trend tilting the table in favour of co-operatives. In 2019, the World Economic Forum released the Davos Manifesto, which argued that the purpose of a company isn’t simply to make money but to “engage all its stakeholders in shared and sustained value creation.” That vision echoed the one that was articulated about four months earlier, in a revised “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation” put out by Business Roundtable, one of America’s most powerful business groups. Tricia Griffith, the president and CEO of Progressive Corporation, was one of the 181 CEOs who signed off on the new statement. “CEOs work to generate profits and return value to shareholders, but the best-run companies do more,” she said in a press release. “They put the customer first and invest in their employees and communities. In the end, it’s the most promising way to build long-term value.” That sounds a lot closer to what co-ops do than previous iterations of the Business Roundtable statement, which were more narrowly focused on shareholder interests and outcomes. Novkovic says this rise of so-called “stakeholder capitalism” creates an important opening for co-operatives—if they can seize the moment. “This is an opportunity for the co-op movement to stand up and say, ‘That’s what we’ve been doing all along. That’s what we’re all about.’” Along with investing in themselves, co-operatives have to do a better job of sharing the understanding that they can invest in one another. MEC, which lost $23.5 million on $462 million in sales in 2018/19, could have turned to the broader co-op family for the capital it needed to keep its business afloat rather than seeking refuge in bankruptcy. The fact that it didn’t was a key lesson for John Kay, a social entrepreneur and the president of Co-operatives and Mutuals Canada. “When I look through all of the public information, it seems fairly apparent that the MEC board didn’t really have an appreciation or a depth of understanding of the co-operative sector and what the co-operative community can do for itself,” he says. MEC was hardly alone on this front. “There is definitely an advantage in being able to trust and reciprocate,” Novkovic says. “But co-ops don’t do that often enough.” If the current moment is to serve as an opportunity to expand the use and influence of the co-operative model, co-operatives across the country will have to do a better job of telling their story and explaining why Canadians should be interested. “It’s understood by the people who are well versed in it, and they’re real champions of it,” Park says. “But I think there’s an opportunity, and even need, to expand an awareness and understanding of it beyond that, to circles that might not generally be exposed to it.” More than anything, Kay says, they have to start fighting for their existence with a sense of urgency that they haven’t before. “We have, quite frankly, rested on our laurels way too much. We believed that everyone knows what a co-operative is, and everyone loves it, and that of course we are such a great thing that nothing could ever happen to us. So we have a hell of a lot of work to do.” For MEC, that fight came too late. But, for other co-operatives in Canada, it could end up saving them—even from themselves.

One year into COVID-19, our definitions are constantly changing. But, when politics distort our language, people can die February 15, 2021February 17, 2021 - by Jonah BrunetJonah Brunet Illustration by Natalie Vineberg, Updated 10:54, Feb. 17, 2021 | Published 12:00, Feb. 15, 2021 As the copy editor of this general-interest magazine, I’ve read a lot of nonfiction about life under lockdown. One writer prophesied the death of the shopping mall. Another noted the improved air quality. Others have navigated the interpersonal novelties of lockdown remote working, lockdown co-living, lockdown dating, and lockdown parenting. But, when each of them used that word, what did they mean? Many magazines have a house dictionary they fall back on for matters of semantic uncertainty. At The Walrus, we use a large, well-worn copy of the second-edition Canadian Oxford Dictionary, from 2004. The physicality of this resource is largely the point: for a copy editor, consistency is a virtue, and what words mean in this dictionary does not change. The downside of a printed dictionary is that it’s soon out of date. The COD’s solitary definition for lockdown is of little help: “the confining of prisoners to their cells, esp. to gain control during a riot etc.” Online, the Oxford English Dictionary is more expansive, including examples of a word’s use going back hundreds of years. It charts the journey from lockdown: a strip of wood for fastening together logs in the construction of a raft (circa 1832), through the prison definition, to lockdown: “More generally: a state of isolation, containment, or restricted access, usually instituted for security purposes or as a public health measure; the imposition of this state.” Another recent definition was put forward last November, when Collins Dictionary named lockdown its word of the year: “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces.” Whoever is choosing them, words of the year tend to be both topical and in some sense new. (Collins’s 2019 pick was climate strike.) Lockdown’s topicality in 2020 was apparent. Its newness was more complex. In February 2021, in the midst of a year-old global pandemic, what is a lockdown? Yes, it’s “a state of isolation, containment, or restricted access,” but what does that mean, specifically, to the daily lives of those living under one? As part of its word-of-the-year announcement, Collins claimed the term “encapsulates the shared experience of billions of people” during COVID-19. For Wuhan’s lockdown, travel into and out of the city of at least 9 million was completely shut down. For Azerbaijan’s, residents of major cities had to receive permission to leave their homes via a government text-messaging system. In Ontario, a recent inspection blitz found that only 59 percent of big-box retailers, like Walmart, which have been allowed to remain open throughout the pandemic, were adhering to public health measures such as requiring everyone to wear masks and keep their distance. Over the holidays, thousands of flights left Canada, several carrying federal and provincial politicians. How much of the lockdown experience are we actually sharing and how much are we pretending to? There’s nothing wrong, or even unusual, about a word acquiring additional shades of meaning as it is used by different people in different contexts over time. But stretch a term too far, to mean too many new things, some of which differ significantly from one another, and you jeopardize its power to unambiguously mean anything. At stake here is far more than the hollowing out of a once useful term—as COVID-19 continues to spread across North America, it has become painfully clear that the measures many of our governments have taken aren’t enough. In the context of public health during a raging pandemic, poor communication isn’t just a pet peeve for copy editors: it’s killing people. How to Lift a Lockdown Lockdown Let the Earth Breathe. What do we do next? Please Stop Sending Me the Oxford Comma Story Languages are democratic in the best, most unruly sense, and semantic shifts are a good illustration of this fact: they are collective efforts, impossible to force on a population without the implied consent of voluntary uptake. Something similar could be said of pandemic lockdowns. But, while language is democratic, lockdowns are not. They are decrees. So another way to arrive at a definition may be to look at how those who wield the term’s power understand it. In a report last November, Ontario’s public health authority investigated the scope and effectiveness of lockdown measures implemented in the first wave of COVID-19 (which occurred roughly in March of that year). The report lists elements of many lockdowns around the world, including school closures, restriction of gatherings, and curfews, before arriving at the key element that constitutes its working definition: “Lockdowns entail stay-at-home recommendations or orders, but the level of restriction accompanying those orders varies.” In an effort to document lockdown’s variability, Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government has compiled the pandemic responses of over 180 national governments. Using data pulled from policy documents by over 400 volunteer researchers around the world, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker quantifies each country’s efforts into a “stringency index,” between zero and 100, based on factors including school and workplace closure, restrictions on internal movement, and restrictions on international travel. “Years from now, when we’re trying to figure out what did and did not work during the pandemic,” says Emily Cameron-Blake, a research assistant on the tracker, “we’ll be able to see those patterns as they emerge.” The pattern that has so far failed to emerge in the data is a link between a country’s stringency index and the impact of its lockdown measures in terms of cases and deaths, which Cameron-Blake acknowledges as one of the project’s biggest limitations. “We steer clear of making any of those correlations or conclusions,” she says. “We’re measuring the policy that’s being implemented, but it’s another thing entirely to measure the actual compliance with it or the enforcement of it.” This delineation between effort and effect is necessary in part because the language of government policy is often a distorted reflection of reality. For instance, contributing to Canada’s score of 67.13 is the fact that federal and provincial governments have put certain border restrictions in place. (In the shorthand of the project’s interactive map, these restrictions amount to “border closure.”) Yet, according to the CBC, Canadian airlines operated more than 1,500 flights to eighteen popular vacation destinations between October and mid-January. Our pandemic response seems better characterized by the exceptions than by the rules. Similarly overstated is Canada’s policy of workplace closures, which the project summarizes as “require closing all but essential.” This is hardly the tracker’s fault: essential has been another semantic casualty of COVID-19. In a January Twitter thread, University of Ottawa associate professor of family medicine Yoni Freedhoff invited Ontarians to anonymously share their experiences in “essential” workplaces. Over 100 people responded, and Freedhoff shared dozens of scenarios in which people were required to show up in person for work they considered nonessential (several chimed in about the film industry, which was exempted from the province’s recent stay-at-home order). Worse still, many alleged that their employers weren’t properly protecting them. This helps explain why, in December, the Globe and Mail reported that workplaces had surpassed long-term-care facilities as viral hot spots, responsible for 30 percent of all active outbreaks in Ontario and 40 percent in Quebec. What is Oxford’s government tracker measuring, then, when it measures stringency? Less what a country is doing or the effects of what it’s doing than what it says it’s doing. The biggest limitation of a project that tracks government responses according to those governments seems to be a faith in the words—essential, closure, lockdown—a faith that, so let it be written, so let it be done. Measured in this way, stringency is no indication of how successful a lockdown will be. The United States, after all, scores a respectable 71.76 despite having mounted arguably the worst pandemic response of any country in the world and, consequentially, having suffered by far the most cases and deaths—over 26 million and 464,000, respectively, and counting. It is especially difficult to concretely define the language used by those in positions of power when we’ve become inured to their empty talk. Meaningless sloganeering has long been a pillar of politics, and in the social media age, buzzwordy statements proliferate. Surveys attest to the downstream effects this can have: this year’s annual Edelman Trust Barometer report found that, since last May, Canadians’ trust in the government “to do what is right” has fallen by 11 percent. We tend to take what our leaders tell us at something less than face value, and they may well mean it that way. It’s never clearer than in a state of emergency how dangerous this can be. The early days of COVID-19 exhibited startling failures of communication. Canada’s chief public health officer assured us that the virus “is going to be rare,” attempting to soothe public anxieties rather than steel Canadians for a worst-case scenario. Around the world, public health authorities, who would later plead that people wear masks, initially advised against them, explaining that there was little evidence of their effectiveness. As suggested in The Lancet last March, the lukewarm mask stance may have had less to do with questions about how well they worked and more to do with preserving supply for health care settings—certainly a rational concern, but worth misleading millions? Rather than insisting that the general population didn’t need masks while stockpiling them for priority use, our leaders might have put out guidelines on how to make our own. Instead, concerns were raised about homemade masks on the grounds that exceptionally shoddy ones could potentially increase the risk of transmission. The lack of trust, it seems, goes both ways. Still, the first-wave lockdown saw Canadians’ trust in government increase, at least as far as COVID-19 was concerned. The same early crisis energy that had people banging pots and pans each night in appreciation of front line workers contributed to generally high confidence in the work officials were doing across the country. The second wave, by contrast, has been met less enthusiastically, and fatigue is only partly to blame. In December, after urging the public to forgo holiday gatherings, more than a dozen elected representatives, political aides, and public health figures jetted off on international flights. Ontario finance minister Rod Phillips even appeared to schedule his social media posts to make it seem as if he was at home rather than vacationing in St. Barts. He later stepped down as finance minister over the uproar, and several other politicians also relinquished their appointments, but the damage was done. As the virus’s alarming resurgence over the winter attests, poor communication causes poor uptake. Canadians generally adhered less to second-wave lockdown measures, with roughly a third of the population saying they would go ahead with holiday gatherings. This is concerning, especially considering that the second wave has been larger than the first, but it’s also understandable. There’s only so long people can live in a state of emergency before the attractions of normal life take over. If my MP can break lockdown for a sun-soaked vacation, why should I have to cancel Christmas dinner? Surveys in November found that Canadians were no less fearful of contracting the virus or contributing to its spread than they were in April. But constant vigilance takes a toll, and many are simply worn out. A successful lockdown is a collective effort, but our lockdowns have weighed more heavily on some than on others. Last spring, a survey of the French population found that low-income respondents tended to view lockdown restrictions less favourably than did high-income respondents, and it seems unlikely that this divide is unique to France. After all, the economic fallout of lockdowns hits the poor harder than it does the rich. Many workers designated “essential” are also low income—a counterintuitive fact that points to a mistake in how we’ve organized society—and stay-at-home orders that exempt their work but not their leisure can seem oppressive. In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services reported that Hispanic communities benefit less from lockdowns because many of their members are part of the front line workforce. The report also noted that, for Hispanic people, hospitalization and death rates associated with COVID-19 are 4.6 times higher than for white Americans. Public attitudes toward lockdowns are a key factor because enforcement is virtually impossible without harming the people a lockdown is meant to protect. Imprisonment is out of the question if the goal is to stop the virus, which has broken out across the country in prisons ill equipped to contain its spread. And fines only further impoverish a population in an uncertain economy. Of course, this hasn’t stopped law enforcement from using lockdowns as yet another cudgel: in Montreal—where, between 2012 and 2019, police issued nearly 40 percent of all fines to people experiencing homelessness—activists called on law enforcement to stop targeting unhoused people for stay-at-home order and curfew violations. (Quebec’s Superior Court later made homeless people exempt from the province’s curfew.) A therapist at the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal told the CBC of a client who, when issued a fine they couldn’t pay for breaking a rule they couldn’t follow, couldn’t help but laugh. The best definition I can offer, then, is lockdown: a failure of imagination. The same process of metaphoric extension that brought the term from prison to our daily lives offered so many missed opportunities. It could have evoked a global common enemy, a fight we’re truly all in together, a war effort without the chauvinistic hangover. Instead, we get locked down. More hardship for those who always endure more hardship, loopholes for those who always get loopholes, hollow proclamations from the same ever-spouting source. None of which should obscure the fact that lockdowns have saved many lives. Defined differently, they might have saved more. Jonah Brunet Jonah Brunet is the copy editor at The Walrus.

Government restrictions may not always be popular among businesses, but they can work February 25, 2021February 26, 2021 - by Rob GillezeauRob Gillezeau Illustration by Irma Kniivila, Updated 13:47, Feb. 26, 2021 | Published 14:36, Feb. 25, 2021 Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen the media presenting a stark trade-off between economic growth and public health measures to limit viral spread. But that idea isn’t coming from my fellow economists, who overwhelmingly support a strong public health response. If we look at the literature, there are a number of research papers consistently finding that the spread of the virus itself, rather than public health measures restricting movement and gathering, explains the vast majority of the decline in economic activity. When the government takes strong measures to limit the spread of the virus, you typically have less contagion within a few weeks. When people lack confidence, when they are not sure that they can go to the store or go to a fitness class safely, economic activity decreases. If you’re not sure that the economy is going to recover rapidly, then you’re less likely to spend because you may lose your job. That’s how the virus really suppresses the economy. The literature is finding that economic activity in the US declined before public health interventions were implemented—that can be explained by virus spread itself. Canada’s Middle Class Is on The Brink of Ruin How Universal Basic Income Will Save the Economy Will the Boomers Cause a Financial Bust? How many Canadians rely on benefits? 27.57M As of October 2020, CERB has received over 27.57 million applications with total value of $80.64 billion distributed to Canadians across the country. $7.2B Since its inception in September 2020, the Canadian Recovery Benefit—CERBs successor—has distributed over $7.2 billion with over 7.2 million applicants. 1.4M People who applied for Employment Insurance in October alone, tripling February’s 446,000 applicants. According to Statistics Canada, this surpasses the amount of application received during the 2008/2009 recession. There is some great research that has been published recently on the 1918 flu, so we can actually look at similar public health interventions in the past. In one study1, the researchers looked at the lockdown measures implemented in various US cities during that pandemic. They found that those measures limited the spread of the flu and, using contemporary economic data, also found that they led to an 11 percent increase in manufacturing employment and an 18 percent increase in manufacturing output over the following years. My expectation, based on the literature and on the fact that it is the virus itself that is driving the decline in economic activity, is that measures that limit the spread of the virus are going to boost our medium-run recovery2. Another recent paper3 discusses how, by lifting public health interventions too early, you may think that you’ve succeeded and you see a little positive blip in GDP, but in reality, GDP growth in the medium run may be suppressed. People go to a few stores, they buy some things—then the virus spreads again, and that actually undermines economic growth. Despite evidence showing the overall benefits of public health measures, there are different impacts on people and industries. One of the great public policy challenges here is compensating folks who take the hardest hits—lower-wage earners in general have had a much slower recovery versus higher-wage4 workers. CERB wasn’t perfect, but the government has done a good job of bridging income and adapting policy during the crisis. In terms of ensuring equitable treatment across companies, for example, the Manitoba government has fined Costco for selling nonessential items while other businesses that sold nonessential items were shuttered. Even after mass vaccination, we could certainly be in a difficult economic position. But it’s possible that the vaccine rolling out will boost confidence enough on its own to have us off to the races in terms of economic growth. 1.

E28: Wency Leung: The Toxicity of Loneliness It’s probably not surprising that so many of our speakers over this past year have focused on the loneliness of lockdown. Part of the reason it’s important to keep having this conversation is to fight the stigma against talking about loneliness and mental health issues. The physical and mental effects of loneliness are as serious as any other health issue. Health reporter Wency Leung immersed herself in this problem in order to cover it.

E20: Kim Samuel: One Year of Social Isolation For many of us, this week marks a full year of social isolation. Urged to stay home and keep our in-person interactions to a minimum we continue to rely on technology to stay connected. Some research even shows that isolation is just as bad as smoking 15 cigarettes per day. Now that we have all experienced 365 days of isolation and the loneliness that comes with it, why would we ever purposely impose such hardship on other people and how do we create a society where everyone belongs? Kim Samuel has some ideas. She taught the first-ever university course on social isolation and social connectedness.

So much that even the crash test dummy is man and a study, originally for the menstrual cycle, was cancelled when viagra was discovered through it. On this International women’s day, it seems like a good time to ask: how can women gain a seat at the table when they aren’t even in the room?

Your choices can transform the world. This applies to everything from the news you take in to the stores you shop at. But this is particularly true when it comes to the food you eat. Irwin Adam urges us to look at what happens before our meals are on our plates. The process is rather inefficient. What can we do to change this? Flour made from insects? Edible packaging? Tasting Data? We need to reimagine the way we taste and consume. Irwin Adam is a Creative Scientist and Food Futurist and he spoke at The Walrus Talks Disruption in 2017.

Accessibility often doesn’t take into account different needs — if it is accessible for one person it might not be for another. Accessibility is not universal, but according to Aimee Louw it can be harmonised across our country. In her talk, activist and podcaster Aimee Louw advocates for a future where accessibility isn’t treated as a favour or charity but as justice and equality. Where people are paid a living wage, where taking care of yourself is prioritised, and where ableism is abolished.

E14: Terry O’Reilly: Putting the Vice back into Advertising It feels like branding and marketing goes in cycles of themes, from earnest to snarky to authentic to sarcastic. At the beginning of the pandemic it all felt very earnest: that banding together, we’re all one human race, let’s get through this together. But as often happens, the cycle … cycled, and we started to get the juicy sarcastic stuff again. A few years ago, Terry O’Reilly, gave his Walrus Talk about vice — are we cycling back up to marketing vice again? Is that even possible in isolation? It was time for an update from the master of advertising himself. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you. E13: Sandy Hudson: Why Am I Waiting for Somebody Else to Do This? It’s hard, separated from each other, living under the threat of a pandemic, witnessing unrest and argument, to feel empowered. But the truth is that each of us has power. Over ourselves for sure. Over our situations, often more than we think.

Whether that was crossing a sea, or moving around Turtle Island, we each have our own beginning that brought us here. So why we do we make anyone feel like an outsider? In her Talk, Carol Off urges us to take a step back and look at where we came from. In this time when we can’t get on a plane, travel to see loved ones, or start our next adventure, we can stay connected by sharing stories from different times and different places.

E9: Teva Harrison: Appreciating the Small Everyday Successes In a world obsessed with instant gratification, Teva Harrison reminds us that there is potential in the quiet moments, the ones without goals or deadlines. She urges us to look at nature and appreciate the small successes of each day: the kindness of a stranger, a chance to do a good deed, a laugh shared with a friend—these are all achievements. Harrison compares the realization of our potential to flowers that grow after the snow melts away, our actions determining when we will blossom. Teva Harrison, was an award-winning writer and graphic artist and she spoke at The Walrus Talks Success in 2018.

As the weather outside becomes snowier and the holidays approach, it gets easier to recognize privilege – right in front of our eyes. The warm home, family gatherings (no more than 10), the ability to give gifts. But, what’s not so easy to see are the full shelters, the nursing homes that can’t have visitors, and long lines for the food bank. At a time when we’re all suffering at different levels, do we have capacity to dig deeper for those that are suffering more?

E5: Hilary Black and the Fight to Legalize Cannabis It wasn’t that long ago that cannabis was illegal in Canada. To many detractors, it was seen as a drug that promotes laziness, rather than a legitimate medicine that can reduce suffering. But tens of thousands of Canadians have regained their ability to function because of medical marijuana. People who were once bedridden are now going outside, playing with their kids, and sleeping at night. So called “normal” activities are made possible again through legal use of medical marijuana.

Lalonde and the (uncomfortable) Canadian Conversation Canadians sometimes congratulate themselves on being “better” in comparison to other countries… More democratic, less violent, more open to new ideas… but…when topics like racism, violence against women, and sexual abuse get brought up, the room – and the Zoom, goes silent.Julie S.

E3: Cherise Burda and the Cost of Location, Location, Location Our thinking about where people live and why has been entirely flipped by this pandemic, but it could just as easily flip right back if a vaccine becomes readily available. In 2015, people were rushing to the city, giving up big houses and spacious yards for small condos and convenience. The cost of their time spent commuting to and from the city outweighed the benefits of living in the suburbs. Now, mid-pandemic, people are leaving the city in herds. Remote work has changed the way people live, and ultimately, where they live. What is the true cost of where you live, and what will you give up in order to save time and money? Cherise Burda is the Executive Director of City Building, at Ryerson University. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you. E2: Kaite Burkholder Harris and the Context of the Homeless You can’t talk about homes and housing without talking about homelessness. It’s a problem that has plagued Canada for too long. Short term solutions cannot eradicate a problem so deeply rooted in our society. In her talk, Kaite Burkholder Harris says that the solution is to look at fixing the context, instead of the person. Burkholder Harris is Executive Director of the Alliance to End Homelessness in Ottawa. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you.

From Halifax to Hydrabad, Nunavut to Nairobi. And what also seems weirdly universal is the support of men’s teams over women’s. Instead of wallowing in this vast discrepancy, Brenda Andress wants us to see it as a place to grow from. A rallying cry to mobilize in support of women in sports.

E24: Noor Naga and the Muslim Mistress Writing is a responsibility in many ways, perhaps none more so than when we think about the cultural expectations inherent in writing as a minority – of any kind. As a woman, as LGBTQ, as a person of colour, as a person with a disability. As writers, what is our responsibility to the rest of our culture? And why does it seem so much heavier than that of CIS-male writers? Noor Naga is a writer and a poet and she spoke at The Walrus Talks “The Future of the Arts,” in 2018.

E19: Bif Naked: a Failing Kidney and a Lifetime of Optimism Anger is one of those emotions that transcends age, race, and political affiliation. Everyone is angry. Feeling trapped in a global pandemic will do that to you. But we can get so caught up in expressing our anger. To balance that, maybe our optimism has to be outrageous. Almost unreasonable… because the bad things in our lives are more reasonable than we know, teaching us lessons we may not see. Here’s singer-songwriter Bif Naked at The Walrus Talks Quality of Life.

Or maybe this is just the result of our small bubbles of safety, but when we have different opinions.. getting caught up in Twitter arguments or disagreeing with family members, it’s easy to forget about what the other person is going through. In this talk, Mustafa Ahmed reminds us that human rights begin with human and that just because disabilities like mental health are seemingly invisible, they are still very much disabilities we need to be aware of.

Urged to stay home and keep our in-person interactions to a minimum we continue to rely on technology to stay connected.

Now that we have all experienced 365 days of isolation and the loneliness that comes with it, why would we ever purposely impose such hardship on other people and how do we create a society where everyone belongs?

But as often happens, the cycle … cycled, and we started to get the juicy sarcastic stuff again. A few years ago, Terry O’Reilly, gave his Walrus Talk about vice — are we cycling back up to marketing vice again? Is that even possible in isolation?

As the weather outside becomes snowier and the holidays approach, it gets easier to recognize privilege – right in front of our eyes. The warm home, family gatherings (no more than 10), the ability to give gifts. But, what’s not so easy to see are the full shelters, the nursing homes that can’t have visitors, and long lines for the food bank. At a time when we’re all suffering at different levels, do we have capacity to dig deeper for those that are suffering more? Valérie Plante is the mayor of Montreal and she spoke at The Walrus Talks at Home at the Broadbent Institute’s 2020 Progress Gala in November.

E5: Hilary Black and the Fight to Legalize Cannabis It wasn’t that long ago that cannabis was illegal in Canada. To many detractors, it was seen as a drug that promotes laziness, rather than a legitimate medicine that can reduce suffering. But tens of thousands of Canadians have regained their ability to function because of medical marijuana. People who were once bedridden are now going outside, playing with their kids, and sleeping at night. So called “normal” activities are made possible again through legal use of medical marijuana. Hilary Black is the Chief Advocacy Officer at Canopy Growth. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you. E4: Julie S. Lalonde and the (uncomfortable) Canadian Conversation Canadians sometimes congratulate themselves on being “better” in comparison to other countries… More democratic, less violent, more open to new ideas… but…when topics like racism, violence against women, and sexual abuse get brought up, the room – and the Zoom, goes silent.Julie S. Lalonde is a women’s rights advocate and public educator. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you. E3: Cherise Burda and the Cost of Location, Location, Location Our thinking about where people live and why has been entirely flipped by this pandemic, but it could just as easily flip right back if a vaccine becomes readily available. In 2015, people were rushing to the city, giving up big houses and spacious yards for small condos and convenience. The cost of their time spent commuting to and from the city outweighed the benefits of living in the suburbs. Now, mid-pandemic, people are leaving the city in herds. Remote work has changed the way people live, and ultimately, where they live. What is the true cost of where you live, and what will you give up in order to save time and money? Cherise Burda is the Executive Director of City Building, at Ryerson University. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you. E2: Kaite Burkholder Harris and the Context of the Homeless You can’t talk about homes and housing without talking about homelessness. It’s a problem that has plagued Canada for too long. Short term solutions cannot eradicate a problem so deeply rooted in our society. In her talk, Kaite Burkholder Harris says that the solution is to look at fixing the context, instead of the person. Burkholder Harris is Executive Director of the Alliance to End Homelessness in Ottawa. Transcript: Microsoft Doc file | Adobe PDF file | Let us know if these formats work for you.

E29: Atom Egoyan on Assimilation and the Wondrous Gift of Canadian Citizenship People from all over the world call Canada home, weaving together cultures from across the globe to create the Canadian identity.

From Halifax to Hydrabad, Nunavut to Nairobi. And what also seems weirdly universal is the support of men’s teams over women’s. Instead of wallowing in this vast discrepancy, Brenda Andress wants us to see it as a place to grow from. A rallying cry to mobilize in support of women in sports.

E25: Annie Kidder on Creating Resilient Communities Through Education As many kids head off to school – in whatever form that takes for them in the midst of a pandemic – it’s easy to pass off the issue of education to the actual humans involved – the parents, the kids and the teachers.

E24: Noor Naga and the Muslim Mistress Writing is a responsibility in many ways, perhaps none more so than when we think about the cultural expectations inherent in writing as a minority – of any kind. As a woman, as LGBTQ, as a person of colour, as a person with a disability. As writers, what is our responsibility to the rest of our culture? And why does it seem so much heavier than that of CIS-male writers? Noor Naga is a writer and a poet and she spoke at The Walrus Talks “The Future of the Arts,” in 2018.

E23: Corb Lund: Desire Trumps Natural Talent Natural talent is overrated – at least according to singer-songwriter Corb Lund. He works hard to create it and believes that work – that constant challenge to focus and refine – is what separates the artists from the rest. And that art itself needs to be accessible to everyone, even the people that don’t see country music as art.

E19: Bif Naked: a Failing Kidney and a Lifetime of Optimism Anger is one of those emotions that transcends age, race, and political affiliation. Everyone is angry. Feeling trapped in a global pandemic will do that to you. But we can get so caught up in expressing our anger. To balance that, maybe our optimism has to be outrageous. Almost unreasonable… because the bad things in our lives are more reasonable than we know, teaching us lessons we may not see. Here’s singer-songwriter Bif Naked at The Walrus Talks Quality of Life.

E18: Ritu Bhasin on Noticing Differences and Asking About Them The barriers to building inclusion can feel insurmountable.

E17: Mustafa Ahmed and the Invisible Disabilities Maybe it was easier to avoid heated debates before we were all living under pandemic rules. Or maybe this is just the result of our small bubbles of safety, but when we have different opinions.. getting caught up in Twitter arguments or disagreeing with family members, it’s easy to forget about what the other person is going through. In this talk, Mustafa Ahmed reminds us that human rights begin with human and that just because disabilities like mental health are seemingly invisible, they are still very much disabilities we need to be aware of.

E16: Zita Cobb on Economics for Belonging Something that gets brought into stark focus at a time like this is the value of things.

Zita Cobb, founder & CEO of the Shorefast Foundation, spoke about the inherent value of things versus what they are financially valued at and the importance of belonging.

E13: Brittany Andrew-Amofah on Stories of Marginalization in a Rapidly Growing City As Canadians from Halifax to Vancouver protest against police brutality and racial discrimination, many are asking how do we make the necessary leap from calls for justice to a tangible change in policing that saves lives?

If cities involve marginalized communities in their systems of governance, could we end police brutality in this country forever?
