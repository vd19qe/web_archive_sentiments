S.R., Thorold Resident I was never a good cook, even when I had my health, so to have Meals on Wheels delivering nourishing and tasty meals to my door is especially appreciated! B.L., Lincoln Resident I was pleasantly surprised to find the meals delicious and nourishing. The cost was nominal and the people from Meals on Wheels were exceedingly kind. Many thanks from a grateful client. W.B., Niagara Falls Resident Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Meals on Wheels for all of the support, thoughtfulness and many kindnesses.
