Local artists, photographers and residents contributed information about the history of Pelham, Ontario. The Pnyx Collection presents student articles and photographs from the 1933-1950 issues of the magazine of Pelham Continuation School, from 1949, Pelham District High School. While the Calendar describes the homes, families and communities of nineteenth century Pelham, the Pnyx shows students adapting to the changes and challenges of the 1930s and 40s. Persons using the historical material in this collection should be aware that it was never intended to be a complete history of Pelham. All the material - articles, photographs and art - was contributed by past and present residents of the Town. They were invited to record their stories, family histories, memories and traditions. What they recorded was accurate to the best of their knowledge at the time. It should not be treated as established fact. Persons using this material are encouraged to do additional research using reputable sources to determine the accuracy of the information.
