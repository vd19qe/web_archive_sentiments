View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In early April, writer Jen Miller urged New York Times readers to start a coronavirus diary. “Who knows,” she wrote, “maybe one day your diary will provide a valuable window into this period.” During a different pandemic, one 17th-century British naval administrator named Samuel Pepys did just that. He fastidiously kept a diary from 1660 to 1669 – a period of time that included a severe outbreak of the bubonic plague in London. Epidemics have always haunted humans, but rarely do we get such a detailed glimpse into one person’s life during a crisis from so long ago. There were no Zoom meetings, drive-through testing or ventilators in 17th-century London. But Pepys’ diary reveals that there were some striking resemblances in how people responded to the pandemic. A creeping sense of crisis For Pepys and the inhabitants of London, there was no way of knowing whether an outbreak of the plague that occurred in the parish of St. Giles, a poor area outside the city walls, in late 1664 and early 1665 would become an epidemic. The plague first entered Pepys’ consciousness enough to warrant a diary entry on April 30, 1665: “Great fears of the Sickenesse here in the City,” he wrote, “it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all.” Portrait of Samuel Pepys by John Hayls (1666). National Portrait Gallery Pepys continued to live his life normally until the beginning of June, when, for the first time, he saw houses “shut up” – the term his contemporaries used for quarantine – with his own eyes, “marked with a red cross upon the doors, and ‘Lord have mercy upon us’ writ there.” After this, Pepys became increasingly troubled by the outbreak. He soon observed corpses being taken to their burial in the streets, and a number of his acquaintances died, including his own physician. By mid-August, he had drawn up his will, writing, “that I shall be in much better state of soul, I hope, if it should please the Lord to call me away this sickly time.” Later that month, he wrote of deserted streets; the pedestrians he encountered were “walking like people that had taken leave of the world.” Tracking mortality counts In London, the Company of Parish Clerks printed “bills of mortality,” the weekly tallies of burials. Because these lists noted London’s burials – not deaths – they undoubtedly undercounted the dead. Just as we follow these numbers closely today, Pepys documented the growing number of plague victims in his diary. ‘Bills of mortality’ were regularly posted. Photo 12/Universal Images Group via Getty Image At the end of August, he cited the bill of mortality as having recorded 6,102 victims of the plague, but feared “that the true number of the dead this week is near 10,000,” mostly because the victims among the urban poor weren’t counted. A week later, he noted the official number of 6,978 in one week, “a most dreadfull Number.” By mid-September, all attempts to control the plague were failing. Quarantines were not being enforced, and people gathered in places like the Royal Exchange. Social distancing, in short, was not happening. He was equally alarmed by people attending funerals in spite of official orders. Although plague victims were supposed to be interred at night, this system broke down as well, and Pepys griped that burials were taking place “in broad daylight.” Desperate for remedies There are few known effective treatment options for COVID-19. Medical and scientific research need time, but people hit hard by the virus are willing to try anything. Fraudulent treatments, from teas and colloidal silver, to cognac and cow urine, have been floated. Although Pepys lived during the Scientific Revolution, nobody in the 17th century knew that the Yersinia pestis bacterium carried by fleas caused the plague. Instead, the era’s scientists theorized that the plague was spreading through miasma, or “bad air” created by rotting organic matter and identifiable by its foul smell. Some of the most popular measures to combat the plague involved purifying the air by smoking tobacco or by holding herbs and spices in front of one’s nose. Tobacco was the first remedy that Pepys sought during the plague outbreak. In early June, seeing shut-up houses “put me into an ill conception of myself and my smell, so that I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell … and chaw.” Later, in July, a noble patroness gave him “a bottle of plague-water” – a medicine made from various herbs. But he wasn’t sure whether any of this was effective. Having participated in a coffeehouse discussion about “the plague growing upon us in this town and remedies against it,” he could only conclude that “some saying one thing, some another.” A 1666 engraving by John Dunstall depicts deaths and burials in London during the bubonic plague. Museum of London During the outbreak, Pepys was also very concerned with his frame of mind; he constantly mentioned that he was trying to be in good spirits. This was not only an attempt to “not let it get to him” – as we might say today – but also informed by the medical theory of the era, which claimed that an imbalance of the so-called humors in the body – blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm – led to disease. Melancholy – which, according to doctors, resulted from an excess of black bile – could be dangerous to one’s health, so Pepys sought to suppress negative emotions; on Sept. 14, for example, he wrote that hearing about dead friends and acquaintances “doth put me into great apprehensions of melancholy. … But I put off the thoughts of sadness as much as I can.” Balancing paranoia and risk Humans are social animals and thrive on interaction, so it’s no surprise that so many have found social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic challenging. It can require constant risk assessment: How close is too close? How can we avoid infection and keep our loved ones safe, while also staying sane? What should we do when someone in our house develops a cough? During the plague, this sort of paranoia also abounded. Pepys found that when he left London and entered other towns, the townspeople became visibly nervous about visitors. “They are afeared of us that come to them,” he wrote in mid-July, “insomuch that I am troubled at it.” Pepys succumbed to paranoia himself: In late July, his servant Will suddenly developed a headache. Fearing that his entire house would be shut up if a servant came down with the plague, Pepys mobilized all his other servants to get Will out of the house as quickly as possible. It turned out that Will didn’t have the plague, and he returned the next day. In early September, Pepys refrained from wearing a wig he bought in an area of London that was a hotspot of the disease, and he wondered whether other people would also fear wearing wigs because they could potentially be made of the hair of plague victims. And yet he was willing to risk his health to meet certain needs; by early October, he visited his mistress without any regard for the danger: “round about and next door on every side is the plague, but I did not value it but there did what I could con ella.” Just as people around the world eagerly wait for a falling death toll as a sign of the pandemic letting up, so did Pepys derive hope – and perhaps the impetus to see his mistress – from the first decline in deaths in mid-September. A week later, he noted a substantial decline of more than 1,800. Let’s hope that, like Pepys, we’ll soon see some light at the end of the tunnel.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to weigh the benefits of keeping green spaces open against the public health concerns that come from their use. During the pandemic, playgrounds have been taped off, parks locked and access to outdoor spaces for recreation cut off. Green spaces have positive effects on mental health, physical fitness, social cohesion and spiritual wellness. Although researchers say the coronavirus spreads more easily indoors than outdoors, they also believe the concentrated use of green spaces will increase the transmission of COVID-19. As cabin fever set in and governments began to ease restrictions, those living in urban areas have turned, en masse, to green spaces. Urban nature has been a source of resilience for many during COVID-19. But the outcome has been disconcerting. COVID-19 has highlighted the inadequacy of green space for the dense populations of cities. It also reinforces existing inequities regarding unequal access to parks in term of size and quality. Human benefits only part of the story Natural features and diverse urban forests are essential for cities to be more resilient and resistant to future challenges, such as invasive species. They are also imperative to how cities can prepare for climate change emergencies by helping manage stormwater, heat stress and air quality. Cities around the world can make incremental adjustments and take on radical overhauls to improve their green spaces. Some cities have already started. Urban green space patches are critically important — and always have been — for biodiversity conservation. But only recently do we seem to appreciate their value and presence. In fact, research has shown that gazing at trees has psychological benefits. Improving green spaces means making use of traditionally grey infrastructure spaces and infusing them with green. Landscapes can be designed with the benefits of plants, soil and biodiversity in mind. (Shutterstock) To do this properly, cities need to adopt an ecosystem planning approach that incorporates nature-based design to make them more liveable and resilient. It also means managing cities as ecosystems. In our field of ecosystem restoration, we talk about patch size and quality, corridors and matrices of green space when we assess landscapes for their ability to support biodiversity. Cities that map these spaces are finding increasing trends (e.g. community stewardship, tree planting initiatives) connecting people and nature. Some cities map the green dots of tree canopy cover to ensure the urban forest is well-managed and to prepare for consequences of climate change. For example, one analysis found Toronto lacked permeable surfaces and growing space on public land, making it difficult for the city to meet its tree canopy target of 40 per cent coverage by 2050, part of its commitment to the local economy and better equip Toronto to face the effects of climate change. Continued investments and partnerships with community and stewardship groups has allowed Toronto to increase canopy cover on private land to about 28 per cent. This connect-the-dots approach can be applied incrementally to increase the availability of green space within neighbourhoods that possess both the need and desire to grow their urban canopy. Incremental adjustments are not enough More radical approaches to landscape design move beyond reactively adding green space to existing grey infrastructure. Instead, decision-makers can prospectively develop landscapes with the benefits of plants and soil in mind. Even when such aspirational policies and plans exist, they may fail because the tools that guide the implementation of ecosystem-based urban plans are often missing. Components of green space design are overlooked because they are quite literally out of sight and therefore out of mind. For example, the specifications for soil quality and quantity are critical to green and blue infrastructure (vegetation and water elements, respectively) are usually insufficient to support nature-based designs. The success stories of large-scale green-blue infrastructure design have something in common: they consider ecosystem services — the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems — first and often. Utrecht, Netherlands, is an excellent example of the resilience nexus that occurs when applying new design principles that support climate adaptation and contribute to a healthy, liveable urban environments. The city has incorporated green-blue infrastructure goals its plans since 2007, and the legacy of this mindset is already obvious. People exercise in a park in the city of Utrecht, Netherlands. (Shutterstock) Within a fixed city boundary and an increasing urban population, green space per household increased 24 per cent between 2009 and 2014. There are other measurable benefits too: trees have made streets more aesthetically appealing and more comfortable on hot days. And by mapping ecosystem services, Utrecht city officials confirmed that green spaces could be easily accessed from any part of the city. In North America, ecosystem services are certainly gaining more attention. A key lesson from Utrecht is that cities must commit to planning using an ecosystem approach if they want healthy, liveable cities that improve biodiversity and support climate adaption. As we navigate the next few months and try to determine what the new normal looks like, cities and municipalities will begin to determine what is feasible. COVID-19 has taught us that availability and accessibility of green space is inadequate. Perhaps as we re-emerge from this crisis, it is the opportune time to pause and consider what is possible.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant amount of attention on our mental health. While organizations are compiling a wide range of online toolkits and templates, the impact of the pandemic on those with pre-existing mental health challenges seems to be missing from our collective conversation. Although all of us are feeling more vulnerable, there are members of our community who were already struggling before physical distancing restrictions were in place. Among the most vulnerable individuals are children and youth with pre-existing mental health challenges. Before the pandemic, rates of mental illness and emergency department visits had been steadily increasing. Years of chronic underfunding have led to a fragmented system marked by excessive wait times and difficulty accessing treatment. As the pandemic unfolded, my clinical work as an academic child and adolescent psychiatrist also changed. Some of the families I work with are doing better, yet many are experiencing more extreme and varied struggles than they were before the pandemic hit. Although the proliferation of online supports has been helpful for many individuals with mild difficulties, every young person and family is unique. Calm is contagious By regulating their own anxieties, caregivers can help kids by enhancing a sense of control and moderation. (Pixabay) Alongside the many young people who are suffering, caregivers are also struggling. For many caregivers, trying to help our loved ones can be profoundly challenging when we feel overwhelmed and helpless. The most important thing we can do is to take care of ourselves. We have to put our oxygen masks on before we try to help others. Although anxiety and fear can be contagious, calm is also contagious. The work of Dr. Bruce Perry, a child psychologist and trauma expert, highlights that caregivers can help their kids regulate by modifying the strategies they use to control their own anxiety, to enhance a sense of control, predictability and moderation. Structure and sleep Enhancing control, predictability and moderation at home can be addressed through balancing structure and flexibility in daily routines. Some caregivers have found it difficult to implement a routine while juggling their responsibilities. Others have tried to implement routine but have been too rigid. Most often, I recommend a “Goldilocks” approach to structure and routine during the pandemic. Avoid extremes, be easy on yourself and keep in mind that balance is everything. A ‘Goldilocks’ approach to routines avoids extremes. (Unsplash) For example, if your child or teen is experiencing “sleep cycle reversal,” where they are up for most of the night and sleeping during most of the day, try to encourage small steps towards improving their routine. Dial back the time they wake up slightly instead of making drastic changes. Discourage naps during the day, encourage them to come out of their room at scheduled times or for a specified amount of time each day. Be flexible and take baby steps. Let them sleep in a little, and ensure that any changes are discussed, negotiated and fine-tuned to your loved one’s needs. Child and adolescent psychiatrists have published some fantastic tools that help with structure. When existing strategies don’t work Another issue for caregivers of young people with pre-existing mental health challenges is that using existing strategies to regulate anxiety may not be sufficient. The chronic stress of the pandemic can amplify existing anxiety. Many caregivers have said that tried-and-tested tools such as paced breathing are not enough. Meanwhile young people have said they are experiencing a complex mix of emotions that they struggle to describe. They want to feel better, but when existing strategies don’t seem to work, they experience a cycle of frustration, helplessness and hopelessness that leads them to feel worse. Young people may be experiencing a complex mix of emotions that they find difficult to describe, and existing strategies may not help them feel better. (Pixabay) Many approaches to addressing anxiety encourage us to try to reason with our emotions. These approaches emphasize how we can fix our feelings through changing how we talk to ourselves. During the pandemic, however, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty around things that are simply outside of our control. When we are confronted with major stress or trauma, trying to fix how we are feeling can sometimes make things worse. Acceptance-based strategies When encountering stressors that are significant and persistent, I encourage the families I work with to shift to acceptance-based strategies. Acceptance involves being aware of your present experience so that you can accept your thoughts and feelings as valid and reasonable while working to prevent them from controlling you. For caregivers, this means accepting what you cannot control and encouraging your loved one to do the same. By accepting that the emotions we are feeling are normal and valid given the circumstances, acceptance helps us to avoid falling into a spiral of self-blame. Validating our emotions and the emotions of our kids and teens helps to prevent these emotions from taking over. When we try to ride an emotional wave, it is also natural that there will be times when these emotions may feel particularly intense or threatening. Rather than try to fight them too hard or swim against the current, we can remind ourselves that we are built for resilience, wired to survive and that with every hardship comes ease. Although none of us knows exactly what lies ahead, whatever comes our way, we will get through it together. For any young person or caregiver who is struggling and feels like they cannot cope, please do not forget that the mental health system is still open and here for you. Please do not be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Mental health Pandemic Coronavirus Child psychology Youth health Teens Kids teens and sleep teen mental health COVID-19 Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With very few exceptions, online teaching and learning will be the primary mode of education for the majority of higher education students in many jurisdictions this fall as concerns about COVID-19 extend into the new school year. As an education researcher who has been studying online education and a professor who has been teaching in both face-to-face and online environments for more than a decade, I am often asked whether online learning at universities and colleges can ever be as effective as face-to-face learning. To be clear: this isn’t a new question or a new debate. I’ve been asked this question in various forms since the mid-2000s and researchers have been exploring this topic since at least the 1950s. The answer isn’t as unequivocal as some would like it to be. Individual cherry-picked studies can support any result. But systematic analyses of the evidence generally show there are no significant differences in students’ academic outcomes between online and face-to-face education. Read more: Textbooks could be free if universities rewarded professors for writing them Researchers also find that some students perform worse online than others — and that some of those differences can be explained by socioeconomic inequities. Advice for students and parents The problems with media comparison studies — that is, those that compare outcomes between one medium, such as face-to-face, to another medium, such as online — are such that many researchers advocate against them. How can students who enrol in online courses in the fall know they are receiving a good educational experience? What are some of the qualities of a good online course? Good online courses can be more personal and rewarding for students than the traditional learning in large lecture halls. (Shutterstock) Here’s some advice for students (and their parents) about what to look for as learning remains online. A good online course is informed by issues of equity and justice. It takes into account social, political and cultural issues — including students’ backgrounds and socioeconomic circumstances — to craft a learning experience that is just. This may take many forms. In practice, it may mean a diverse and intersectional reading list. It means audiovisual materials that don’t stereotype, shame or degrade people. It may mean that open educational resources are prioritized over expensive textbooks. A good online course is interactive. Courses are much more than placeholders for students to access information. A good online course provides information such as readings or lecture videos, but also involves interactions between professor and students and between students and students. Interactions between professor and students may involve students receiving personalized feedback, support and guidance. Interactions among students may include such things as debating various issues or collaborating with peers to solve a problem. A good online course often becomes a social learning environment and provides opportunities for the development of a vibrant learning community. A good online course is engaging and challenging. It invites students to participate, motivates them to contribute and captures their interest and attention. It capitalizes on the joy of learning and challenges students to enhance their skills, abilities and knowledge. A good online course is cognitively challenging. A good online course involves practice. Good courses involve students in “doing” — not just watching and reading — “doing again” and in applying what they learned. In a creative writing class, students may write a short story, receive feedback, revise it and then write a different story. In a computer programming class, they may write a block of code, test it and then use it in a larger program that they wrote. In an econometrics class, they might examine relationships between different variables, explain the meaning of their findings and then be asked to apply those methods in novel situations. A good online course is effective. Such a course identifies the skills, abilities and knowledge that students will gain by the end of it, provides activities developed to acquire them and assesses whether students were successful. A good online course includes an instructor who is visible and active, and who exhibits care, empathy and trust for students. This individual understands that their students may have a life beyond their course. Not only do many students take other courses, but they may be primary caretakers, have a job or be struggling to make ends meet. Good online courses often include instructors who are approachable and responsive, and who work with students to address problems and concerns as they arise. A good online course promotes student agency. It gives students autonomy to enable opportunities for relevant and meaningful learning. Such a course redistributes power - to the extent that is possible - in the classroom. Again, this may take many forms in the online classroom. In the culinary arts, it may mean making baking choices relevant to students’ professional aspirations. In an accounting course, students could analyze the financial statements of a company they’re interested in rather than one selected by the instructor. Such flexibility not only accommodates students’ backgrounds and interests, it provides space for students to make the course their own. In some cases it might even mean that you - the student - co-designs the course with your instructor. This is the kind of flexibility higher education systems need. These qualities aren’t qualities of good online courses. They are qualities of good courses, period. Physical proximity isn’t a precondition for good education. Comparing one form of education to another distracts us from the fact that all forms of education can — and should — be made better.

New work spaces In the past, knowledge workers might have been centralized into one, or a few locations, with controlled access to information. Now they are are dispersed across thousands of sites that the enterprise has no control over. Face-to-face communications are taking place on open, web-based platforms like Zoom, bbCollaborate, BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Google Meet and many others, all vying for market share in an attempt to become the industry standard. Concurrently, managers in organizations are dealing with unseen reductions in business volumes and making the difficult decisions of laying-off employees, shutting down plants and stores, and yet somehow still maintaining some kind of presence and level of customer service in the hope of recovering losses once the pandemic response restrictions are eased. The challenges for enterprises of all kinds, then, are many: How can they maintain service levels while managing cuts and workarounds? How do they provide employees with the equipment, tools, resources and information to work from home? How do they balance restrictions from the lockdown against recovery when it lifts? How do they support employees and protect them from burnout, exhaustion and other mental health issues? This is especially true for administrative front-line workers like those in information technology (IT) who are now responsible for maintaining secure, fully operational and accessible virtual work environments. Staff who work in information technology for businesses are dealing with extra demands on their time and expertise. (Shutterstock) Adapting for cyber-resiliency The “start, stop, continue” approach offers a powerful structure to frame possible answers to the questions and dilemmas surrounding cybersecurity. Here, I offer three things to start, two to stop, and three to continue to ensure strong cyber-resilience is retained. START: The most important thing to start is to monitor internal and external security threats and incidents. A few months ago, most of us had not even heard of Zoom, much less used it on a daily basis for both work and social gatherings. Most of us were not used to working from home, accessing work files remotely, uploading and downloading gigabytes of data. Most of us did not have more than rudimentary security on our home routers and networks. Most of us only had a passing knowledge of the IT support staff at work (usually called in a panic). For managers and executives, this means daily reports on security incidents, their sources (internal or external), their nature and whether new types of attacks and attackers have been observed. Enterprises also need to start asking themselves about the impact this new work environment has had on customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Executives should monitor what is being adjusted, and how. For example, to what extent are access permissions (to databases, files, systems and information) being increased? Concurrently, to what extent are insider monitoring programs being deployed to ensure employees do not inadvertently, or deliberately leak confidential or proprietary information? Finally, the time has come to start enhanced online security protocols and tools, like multi-factor authentication, which only 57 per cent of enterprises are using. STOP: In dealing with the new, distributed and virtual operating environment, organizations should first immediately stop or suspend any non-critical IT projects: this is not the time to continue with replacement of administrative systems, access systems, enterprise networking enhancements, application development or any other project aimed at changing or enhancing business processes. There are two reasons for this. First, IT staff burnout increases exponentially in the current situation. They are dealing with a deluge of requests to configure home systems, manage access, provide ad hoc and formal training and deal with emergency shutdowns, not to mention an increased risk of breaches. They are not only at risk of burning out, but of making critical errors if they are also asked to continue non-essential development work. The second reason is that hackers and other criminals will deliberately target organizations that are attempting to juggle remote staff support and IT development, perceiving these organizations to be weak, unfocused and inattentive. Shadow IT are information systems or applications that individuals or departments use without the knowledge or support of IT staff in the organization. For example, a marketing manager may prefer to use privately sourced customer relationship management software that they find more accessible and modifiable, without the need to submit change requests to an IT department. The problem with shadow IT is that it has not been vetted for any potential security vulnerabilities. In the event of a breach, system administrators may not be notified or able to contain the breach if it emerges from a shadow system. CONTINUE: Most organizations have well-developed crisis response plans as part of their enterprise risk frameworks. These documents need to be updated to reflect the new circumstances. Organizations need to contact their insurance providers — including for cyber-insurance — and third-party support providers to alert them to their new operating environment. Like the enterprises they serve, these insurers and providers are also trying to cope and may be temporarily overburdened. Finally, organizations must continue to rehearse and update these plans. Executives need to continue monitoring resources in their organizations, and where necessary, rapidly adjust budgets, staffing levels and other resources, allocating them to those areas that most need them. This might mean re-allocating IT development budgets and staff to cybersecurity or plant and office maintenance to supporting remote work environments. Finally, executives need to ensure that succession plans for key staff are current. This is especially true for IT and cybersecurity personnel. Preparing for the unknown COVID-19 will prove to be a generational event with long-lasting and as yet unknown effects on society. By critically considering and discussing what to Start, Stop, or Continue with regards to cyber-resilience, businesses and their employees will be in a better position to anticipate, mitigate and flourish in current conditions and beyond.

Partners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on our fraying social safety nets, fragile domestic and global food systems, and the unacceptable precarity faced by newcomers, front-line workers and those living on the economic margins. Newcomers — recent immigrants, refugees, undocumented workers and international students — are vital to the Canadian economy. We depend on them to provide access to the low-cost foods we have come to expect. But at the grocery checkout, we aren’t paying for the true costs incurred by the ways we grow, manufacture and globally distribute food. Read more: 100 days of coronavirus has sent shock waves through the food system Newcomers are often precariously employed and food insecure, and may not have access to the culturally appropriate foods and food practices key to building successful connections in their new communities. Addressing these barriers could help repair some of the cracks in the system. Newcomers in the food system Newcomers’ vulnerability is not innate, but created. They are often overlooked because they make up a largely racialized and often economically disadvantaged population. Newcomers have uncertain living circumstances and access to fewer social supports. They experience higher rates of food insecurity and occupy many of the most under-valued, high-risk, hidden and low-paying jobs in our food systems. People hold up signs during a demonstration in Montréal calling on the federal government to give residency status to migrant workers, on June 6, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes The Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) brings tens of thousands temporary foreign workers into Canada each year, mostly to work on farms. Protections for SAWP workers differ from one province to the next, but generally workers are exempt from regulations for minimum wage, overtime pay or maximum daily work hours, and cannot collect employment insurance even though they make contributions. Their visas are tied to one employer, making them vulnerable to abuse and job loss if they refuse unsafe work or submit a complaint. Moreover, migrant agricultural workers are viewed as low-skilled, easily replaceable labouring bodies, despite their demonstrable knowledge and skills. This adds to their invisibility. During the pandemic, the federal government deemed food workers in grocery stores, cafeterias and farms — many of them newcomers — as essential workers, and relaxed regulations to allow international students in these roles to work longer hours. On May 7, Trudeau announced a wage top-up for essential workers, but each province determines who will — and will not — receive this benefit. Financial and cultural food insecurity Ultimately, newcomers are situated at the fault lines of Canada’s social safety nets and food systems. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 at two meat-packing plants in Alberta, staffed mainly by temporary foreign workers and new immigrants, are cases in point. However, even before the pandemic, newcomers disproportionately experienced poverty and one of its main symptoms, food insecurity. Beyond the financial barriers to food access, newcomers are regularly unable to access culturally appropriate foods or practise culturally meaningful “foodways,” such as growing, sharing and selling food among their cultural and linguistic communities. Read more: Migrant workers face further social isolation and mental health challenges during coronavirus pandemic Secure access to culturally appropriate foods, or cultural food security, is an important, but unmeasured and largely unexplored component of food security. Cultural food security is key Emerging research, as well as our experience working with newcomer communities, suggests cultural food security is key to newcomers’ sense of identity and personhood, connection to linguistic and cultural communities, nutritional status and grounding in their new communities. We’ve found that settlement services and programming for newcomers, however, tend to focus on skills training and employment. They often overlook the ways that access to culturally meaningful food and traditional food practices are important to newcomers’ settlement. Moreover, popular depictions of healthy eating are typically Eurocentric and sometimes stigmatizing and offensive. Hanan Akash helps prepare a typical Syrian meal at The Newcomer Kitchen Project at the Depanneur restaurant in Toronto in July 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov Enabling newcomers to grow culturally diverse food is an opportunity to meet their needs, and to strengthen our food systems. Statistics Canada reports that newcomers start businesses, many of them food businesses. However, compassionate and just settlement support means that we must transform the dominant food system into one that embraces a focus on health, well-being and dignity for newcomers, rather than the commodity-driven, cheap food system. The Newcomer Kitchen in Toronto has helped newcomers access paid employment and culturally meaningful foods. But more can be done. For example, many newcomers arrive with agricultural knowledge and skills to grow culturally diverse foods, but the capital required to begin production is prohibitive. Assisting newcomers to enter the agricultural sector as owners and operators, rather than as seasonal workers is one way that Canada could address the barriers newcomers face in accessing culturally appropriate food. Ultimately, policy and program options that address financial and other barriers for newcomers to culturally appropriate foods and food practices are needed to repair the cracks in our social safety nets and the food systems that COVID-19 has brought into the spotlight for many Canadians.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 has turned the world on its head. Many socio-economic benefits Canadians took for granted are now under threat, and the economic, infrastructure and environmental problems that we were once content to ignore are now glaringly obvious. A recent United Nations report shows that most of Earth’s ecosystems are in serious decline, and this is also true for Canada. In addition, our infrastructure is failing: most of the country’s roads, bridges, stormwater and sewer systems were built just after the Second World War, and up to 40 per cent are close to their expiration dates. But repairing infrastructure is expensive. Cities own two-thirds of it but receive only eight per cent of all tax dollars and, historically, they have set aside very little money for infrastructure operations, maintenance and rewnewal. As attentions begin to shift towards economic recovery, some communities are beginning to incorporate natural assets such as lakes, forests or streams into their infrastructure planning while maintaining and improving municipal services such as drinking water supplies, flood protection and stormwater management. Doing so can save municipalities billions of dollars on investments such as water treatment plants. Economic recovery with natural assets Natural assets provide benefits to people in the form of ecosystem services like managing stormwater, regulating local climate and filtering pollution. Natural asset approaches do not see people as separate from nature. Instead, they understand that we are part of nature and that nature can support solutions to societal challenges. As a subset of green infrastructure, natural assets produce societal, environmental and economic benefits. Green infrastructure increases resilience to environmental challenges like climate change, which has emerged as a major threat to cities the world over. In addition, the green infrastructure sector in Ontario alone contributes over $8 billion to our national economy and more than 120,000 jobs. A tow truck driver walks back through floodwaters after hooking up a car on the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto in July 2013. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn Examples of urban natural asset planning and management can be found in progressive cities across the world. For instance, the latest urban plan for Stockholm, Sweden, has explicitly integrated the city’s natural assets. The plan gives direction to maintain and strengthen green infrastructure like parks and forests. These assets will be important for increasing climate change resilience and protecting the quality of life and health of Stockholm’s residents. In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, urbanization and climate change combine to increase the frequency of floods and urban heating. These floods damage property, disrupt infrastructure and cause sewer backups, while urban heating increases air pollution and causes heat stress. In response to these threats, the city has developed a climate adaptation strategy that includes plans to expand and strengthen the city’s green spaces to increase water storage capacity and reduce urban heating. Read more: How cities can add accessible green space in a post-coronavirus world In Canada, the town of Gibsons, B.C., has incorporated the local pond system into their municipal asset management plan. The ponds function as a stormwater system that stores, cleans and filters water that would otherwise require storm sewers, bypass pipes and other forms of engineered infrastructure at a cost of $3.5 million to $4 million. An important additional benefit is that natural assets can help fight climate change by capturing carbon. The Municipal Natural Assets Initiative, which works with local governments to account for and manage their natural assets, has partnered with Gibsons on its stormwater management study. It is now scaling up that example for other communities across Canada, and is helping address some of the barriers that local governments face in managing their natural assets. Investments into natural assets could help municipalities that are stretched thin due to higher spending and lower revenues from COVID-19. Maximizing economic stimulus spending One of the best practices of disaster management is “building back better” to increase resilience in the community and the rest of the country. This includes investments in services and infrastructure. Natural asset strategies such as reforestation initiatives can contribute to generating the needed economic stimulus for recovery efforts. Nature-based solutions that support vital ecosystem services can reduce the financial costs of climate change, contribute to job creation, increase resilience and reduce poverty. In late April, data from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities showed that Canadian communities faced $10 billion to $15 billion in near-term, non-recoverable losses from lost property taxes, utility charges and decreased transit ridership, and called for at least $10 billion in emergency operation funds from the federal government. So far, the federal government has only committed to release the annual Gas Tax Fund funding to municipalities as an early, one-time transfer of $2.2-billion. Extensive forests line the Don River Valley Park with the Prince Edward Viaduct and Toronto skyline in the background. (Jess/Wikimedia Commons), CC BY-SA The country needs additional investments. The 50 Million Tree Program might be an example of a great target for this. After the Ontario government pulled the funding for this program, the federal government stepped in and guaranteed funding until 2023. Planting urban trees is as close as it gets to a magic bullet in our fight against climate change and air pollution. Expanding the 50 Million Tree Program and continuing it past 2023 would be a great investment with short and long-term economic benefits. A portion of any federal or provincial stimulus investments should be used to support natural assets and green infrastructure projects that protect ecosystems, improve municipal service delivery, produce jobs and strengthen the economy. Doing so could save municipalities millions — if not billions — of dollars in infrastructure service costs. Let’s not lose out on this opportunity to make our municipalities more resilient to the future threats that we know will come.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The average times of the fastest sprinters in the 100-metre dash are in the ballpark of 10 seconds. So, what would you think if someone promised to run the race in one second? It typically takes a minimum of 10 years for a vaccine to complete the three consecutive phases of the clinical research pipeline. This is because of the scope and length of the experiments, the need to critically assess the results at each stage and the mountains of paperwork that are involved. What are the chances that this can be reduced to 12 months? Indeed, it has been implied that this process can be accelerated to “warp speed.” It usually takes about 10 years to develop and test a new vaccine. (Shutterstock) We contend that a safe and effective vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of coronavirus disease COVID-19, most likely cannot be made available to the public in time to make a substantial difference to the natural outcome of this pandemic. People often cling to hope even when prospects of success are low. However, this can have negative consequences if that hope is not realized. We are academic scientists who manage vaccine research programs. In fact, Dr. Bridle received COVID-19-focused funding to develop a novel vaccine platform. Although many of us are working hard towards developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, we worry that some in the scientific community have offered too much hope for this to be accomplished in a timely fashion. Sometimes these promises are used by politicians and governments to inform public policies. As a result, the integrity of the scientific community is now in the limelight and, arguably, at risk. Herd immunity Vaccines are an effective way for a population to achieve what is known as “herd immunity.” This is the concept that the pandemic will end once approximately 60-70 per cent of people become immune to SARS-CoV-2. An alternative is to let SARS-CoV-2 run its natural course until herd immunity is achieved. With physical distancing, some epidemiologists argue this could take two years, during which time a vaccine could be developed. Social and physical distancing signs on the floors of various business throughout Vancouver and surrounding area are pictured between May 1-12, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward However, vaccinating at the tail end of a pandemic when disease incidence is very low and declining may be of little utility, hence the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. If one is not in widespread use within the first half of 2021, it will probably be too late to have a meaningful impact on control of COVID-19. Lessons from SARS and MERS Educators often rely on past performance to predict the future performance of students. In this respect, how was the performance of the scientific community in the wake of the original SARS-CoV, or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV? The fact is, no vaccine against a coronavirus has successfully navigated the rigours of clinical testing, despite having up to 17 years to do so. The same applies to other dangerous respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus. Whether enough has been learned from these past experiences to get the design of COVID-19 vaccines right remains to be seen, and still does not negate the need for a rigorous testing process that will take time. 3D print of a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in front of a 3D print of a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle. The spike protein (foreground) enables the virus to enter and infect human cells. On the virus model, the virus surface (blue) is covered with spike proteins (red) that enable the virus to enter and infect human cells. (U.S. National Institutes of Health) One concern is that some vaccines can protect against disease (that is, the outcome of an infection) but not against infection (the ability of the virus to get into the body). In this scenario, vaccinated individuals could potentially become asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, thereby spreading COVID-19. For this and many other reasons, a cautious approach must be taken to developing COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines already in clinical trials What about the fact that there are front-runner vaccines already in human clinical trials? First, many of the vaccine technologies that can most readily make it to the front of the line are not necessarily the best quality. The easiest way to make a vaccine is to inactivate the pathogen or use pieces of it, and mix them with an adjuvant, which tells the immune system that the pathogen is dangerous and worth responding to. Illustration of coronavirus structure. (Pixabay) However, an inactivated virus or its components do not behave like the live virus, so the immune system sometimes responds to these vaccines in a way that is ineffective or sometimes even dangerous. For example, no vaccine based on the genetic material, known as ribonucleic acid or RNA, from a virus like SARS-CoV-2 has ever been approved. Further, some vaccines developed against the original SARS-CoV, after the epidemic was over, exacerbated the disease in mice. A vaccine for COVID-19 does not have to be the best one, but it does need to be good enough to accelerate a population’s progression to herd immunity. As experienced peer reviewers, we have some concerns about the rigour of some of the science surrounding COVID-19 vaccines. Some vaccines are fast-tracking through the regulatory system before studies are completed and with minimal details of experimental results being released. Executives of a big pharmaceutical company whose vaccine is among those closest to the finish line recently sold their stocks after releasing “positive results” that were superficial, partial and that included three of eight healthy young volunteers experiencing severe adverse events. Events like this are causing the public to become skeptical. A promising vaccine should have solid data to back it up. Those touting vaccines against COVID-19 that are in clinical trials should be asked to provide comprehensive details and results of their study. This enables objective and rigorous evaluations by the broader scientific community. A lack of complete transparency would be cause for concern. Getting from trials to clinics Assuming a vaccine succeeds in human trials, it then needs to be manufactured in massive quantities at an affordable price, undergo quality control testing and be distributed worldwide. Even if by some miracle this spectrum could be bridged at warp speed, one then needs to wonder if up to 70 per cent of individuals can be effectively vaccinated. Once a vaccine is developed and approved, it would have to be mass manufactured and distributed before people could get the shot. (Pixabay) Uptake of a vaccine could be compromised by anti-vaxxers, as well as by perceptions that warp-speed manoeuvring might be the result of cutting too many corners and compromising safety. Then there are those who simply do not respond as well to vaccines, which includes the elderly who are in the greatest need of protection. Considering what we now know about SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we need to take a more cautious approach and one could question if any of the vaccines that are now in pre-clinical testing can possibly help with the current pandemic. We sincerely hope that our pessimism about vaccines currently in clinical trials being ready in time is soundly proven wrong. Even if a vaccine doesn’t get developed in time, not all is lost. The array of vaccines being engineered will help with outbreaks beyond COVID-19. They can be vetted by scientists and the best technologies and associated research teams could be shortlisted to be called upon for future outbreaks. Although clinical research likely cannot be shortened to 12 months while maintaining integrity of the science, the current attempt to do so will build new and reasonable efficiencies into health regulatory policies. This will facilitate getting a wide variety of future health solutions to patients faster, but not at warp speed.

Partners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Investors are pushing companies to develop environmental plans, consider the social impacts of their operations and improve the integrity of how they are governed to ensure that women, workers and all stakeholders are fairly represented. In other words, environmental, social and governance policies — ESG for short — are now important business considerations. ESG proponents argue that when companies place importance on reducing their carbon footprint, emphasizing workplace management or improving board diversity, they are doing good business that will generate greater long-term financial returns for their investors. ESG investors base their objectives on achieving competitive financial returns along with one or more of the following: The belief that ESG principles can help companies contribute to investment returns through long-term value creation. Their values are consistent with the investments they hold. For example, those with strong views against nuclear energy will not invest in any mining or utility company involved in nuclear power. Investments should make a positive impact on the world. Extending the previous example, an ESG investor would buy shares in green energy companies, ultimately wishing to see those companies replace carbon-based energy sources. How successful are ESG investors? If ESG projects impact business performance, then it stands to reason that they should help drive financial returns. Many academic and industry studies have looked into this, however, and there is no conclusive evidence that ESG investing leads to superior returns for investors. There is, however, evidence that ESG stock portfolios using negative screens (for example, by eliminating questionable companies such as tobacco producers or gun manufacturers) produce lower returns. Finance theory shows that a well-diversified portfolio reduces risk without affecting returns. Eliminating stocks, especially entire industries, from a portfolio leads to a less diversified portfolio and therefore higher risks with the same return, or lower returns with the same risk. There is also evidence that morally questionable companies, divested by ESG investors, see their stock prices initially fall, but earn higher returns for their non-ESG investors going forward. Studies also suggest that stock prices do not fully reflect the value of intangible assets, which include sustainability initiatives. In this case, ESG investors that identify such intangible assets and buy those undervalued stocks should logically earn superior returns once the market recognizes the stock’s true worth and efficiently values those assets into the company’s stock price. Research indicates this occurs to some degree. How to determine ESG measures There is concern within the investment community that there is no standard definition of what comprises ESG measures. Take the case below. There are two lists, with data from Capital IQ. One is the 10 largest investments in a large, established American ESG mutual fund, while the other is the largest 10 companies in the S&P 500 index. Which list, A or B, represents the ESG fund? List A List B Microsoft Apple Apple Microsoft Amazon.com Amazon.com Visa Alphabet Danaher Corp. Facebook Adobe Berkshire Hathaway BlackRock Visa Thermo Fisher Scientific Johnson & Johnson Fidelity National Info Services Walmart Bank of America JPMorgan Chase You can forgive yourself if you had difficulty choosing the correct list. It’s list A. Four of the ESG mutual fund’s top 10 holdings are the same as the S&P 500 index’s top 10 holdings. In another example, a well-established Canadian ESG fund includes Suncor Energy, the largest oilsands producer, as one of its top investments. Well-known financial services firms such as MSCI, S&P Global and FTSE Russell rate companies for their handling of ESG issues. It is big business. Portfolio managers then use those ratings to identify which firms should be considered for their ESG portfolios. In 2018, MSCI ranked electric car-maker Tesla No. 1 in ESG for auto manufacturers, while FTSE Russell ranked Tesla last on its ESG auto ratings. This is an example of how subjective these ratings are. The obvious problem is that it leaves investors in the dark about whether Tesla is in fact an ESG-positive company. Is Tesla an ESG-conscious company? Depends on who you ask. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) Recently, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission announced it has launched an investigation and “… wants to know whether money managers are engaging in false advertising by saying funds are devoted to doing good when the reality is much murkier,” according to Bloomberg. Unintended consequences To the extent that companies successfully carry out their ESG plans, positive environmental or social outcomes can occur. There may, however, be unintended consequences. Vincent Deluard, a director at INTL FCStone Inc., a financial advisory firm, found that companies that are likely to do well on ESG scores typically produce more revenue and higher profit margins with few employees, are often found in higher human capital sectors such as health care or information technology. Shareholders may get rich with these companies, but they do little to improve the lot of the average hourly wage earner. He writes: “ESG investing was originally designed as a response to the flaws of capitalism, as a way to turn the profit motive in a force for good. However, ESG filters (unintentionally) reward the greatest illnesses of post-industrial societies: winner-take-all capitalism, monopolistic concentration, and the disappearance of jobs for normal people.” The average market capitalization per employee of the 10 ESG stocks (in List A above) is US$6.4 million per employee, while the S&P 500 company average is US$3.6 million. While this is simply anecdotal evidence, it is consistent with Deluard’s findings. Is investing for competitive financial returns based on ESG principles like searching for fool’s gold? We can say the intent is noble, and the actions are sincere, but the execution is simply not developed enough to deliver the types of benefits socially responsible investments claim to deliver.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Every year around the world, entrepreneurs sell or cut ties to their businesses, including in countries known as being optimal for entrepreneurship, like Germany, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada. But the majority of these entrepreneurs don’t have an exit strategy and therefore lack a full understanding of what’s involved in leaving their companies. An entrepreneurial exit entails cutting ownership ties and managerial function in a company. Among the possible reasons are: The health and age of entrepreneurs. The shifting of their work-life balance. Exhaustion and boredom with routine. The emergence of another lucrative and rewarding opportunity. The inability to cope with market turbulence and to mitigate against market uncertainty. The incapability to manage ongoing financial problems, as well as to deal with unavoidable financial problems that surface during crises, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Business exit by bankruptcy. Exit strategies Entrepreneurs planning an exit from their business can follow different withdrawal strategies (for example, family succession, private sales to individuals, management buyout, management buy-in and initial public offerings). The most important consideration is making the wise decision and selecting the most appropriate withdrawal strategy. Our study of 302 firms operating in the European Union revealed that withdrawal decisions made by entrepreneurs are influenced by their various social networks, including family and close friends and colleagues, collaborators and business partners. These social networks’ relationships (or ties) can be classified as “strong” or “weak.” Strong ties are those nurtured with family members and friends. Weak ties are those established with business associates, acquaintances and other distant individuals, which often bridge distant and distinct social networks to connect the entrepreneur to information and resources that aren’t readily available and easily accessible through strong ties. Social ties can be categorized as strong or weak. Strong ties are close family and friends; weak ties are business colleagues. (Charles Forerunner/Unsplash) We discovered that if the size of the weak ties network is bigger than that of family and friends, entrepreneurs are more likely to choose a sale of the firm. This new insight can be explained by the fact that professional networks with workplace colleagues and business partners are usually the source of multi-faceted industry and sector perspectives, elusive market or technology-related information and novel ideas that can be especially helpful in assessing the value of a company and the benefit of selling it. This “opportunity capital” allows entrepreneurs to fully and thoroughly explore and exploit emerging opportunities, and understand how to best capitalize on opportunities. At the same time, according to the results of our research, it’s not just the size of the entrepreneurs’ network, but also the relevance of those connections that’s a significant predictor of the selection of an exit strategy. Family succession Interestingly, when strong ties are more relevant to entrepreneurs than weak ties, they will be much more inclined to opt for family succession. This seems to be particularly true for family business owners who are emotionally attached to their business and want to see their firm continuing its life under the hands of their relatives, creating a multi-generation family firm. It should also be noted that entrepreneurs, especially those who are unprepared and lack experience in choosing and planning a business exit, may be under a lot of stress when having to make exit decisions and may find it hard to stay focused and difficult to feel confident about their decision-making. That suggests trusted family and friends are an important source of emotional support. This emotional support can result in family and friends having a greater influence in an entrepreneur’s future planning and decision-making. Social networks critical So what is the most valuable takeaway here? It’s clear from our analysis of more than 300 European small- and medium-sized enterprises that social networks play a critical role in helping an entrepreneur decide how to exit from a business, highlighting once again the many benefits of both personal and professional relationships. It’s also clear that the accumulation and expansion of the “who-you-know” information and knowledge through social networking can help generate “what-you-know” information and knowledge, which can be useful during normal times as well as in times of crisis. That means entrepreneurs need to pay a lot of attention to the creation and maintenance of their social networks because their importance may grow stronger during a time of crisis. These social ties can potentially help entrepreneurs acquire needed information and insights, make better assessments of opportunities or threats regarding an exit strategy and receive feedback and emotional support. business management Corporations Entrepreneurship Businesses Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Retail was in trouble long before COVID-19 hit. The past five years saw daily reports of store closures and retailer bankruptcies. The growth of online commerce eroded many retailers’ top-line revenues, forcing them into an ongoing cycle of discounts and promotions just to keep up. But even amid this debacle, direct-to-consumer brands increasingly expanded their physical presence. Warby Parker, the online eyewear provider, currently operates 65 outlets and Away, the luggage company, recently raised US$100 million to open 50 stores. But when COVID-19 brutally put a stop to physical retail, many strained small- and medium-sized businesses quickly moved their business online, as shown by Shopify’s 47 per cent revenue growth in this year’s first quarter. Customers previously reluctant to shop online placed their first orders, boosting e-commerce numbers proportionately. Typically, it takes an average of two months before a new behaviour becomes a habit, adding more pressure on struggling brick-and-mortar retailers that don’t have good online offerings if they can’t get customers back in stores promptly to satisfy them. Some worry they might never recover. Not all bleak Nevertheless, all is not gloom and doom. After months of confinement and a surprisingly flawed online experience, people yearn to return to normal. The COVID-19 restrictions have exacerbated our natural need for social connection. Despite being digitally connected, people crave face-to-face human contact. That’s evident in the retail activity in recently reopened countries. At its Guangzhou, China, flagship store, Hermès registered US$2.7 million in sales on its first day. In Paris, long lines stretched in front of the Champs-Élysées H&M store. People wait outside the Louis Vuitton shop on Champs-Élysées Avenue in Paris on June 3, 2020. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) And in Montréal recently, dozens stood patiently outside a downtown Zara, eager to buy summer clothes. The urge to get out and socialize prevailed over safety concerns. Some employees are similarly impatient to leave the house to resume work. While most office staff transitioned easily to remote work, some suggest COVID-19 has exacerbated the loneliness and lack of social interactions, despite companies’ claims of sustained productivity. Read more: How remote working can increase stress and reduce well-being For retail staff who thrive on human contact, the situation has been difficult. Most are itching to return to their stores. Personal human connection versus digital Beyond the craving for social contact, the human touch is also what many retailers rely upon, especially in the beauty and luxury sectors, where sensory experiences are critical. A recent PwC Consumer Intelligence Survey of 15,000 global consumers confirms what has been observed in countless shopper-retailer interactions: The human touch still matters, with 75 per cent stating they want more in the future, not less. Furthermore, most shoppers consider customer experience more important than price and product quality. Similarly, in the hospitality and travel sectors, human contact prevails. When COVID-19 hit, personal connections with travel advisers helped hundreds of travellers return home after their flights were cancelled. Customers with e-platform reservations, meantime, struggled. A traveller arrives on an international flight at Toronto’s Pearson Airport in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young In the COVID-19 recovery period, physical stores are uniquely poised to offer this crucial human interaction. A 2015 study led by Marshall Fisher, professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School of Business, clearly shows the importance of human interaction in retail, and its impact on revenues. Yet in 2020, as retailers slowly reopen, they’re focusing on safety and hygiene protocols but continuing to fail to invest in their own human capital. Instead of recognizing the long-term benefits of devoting attention to their employees, they obsess over minimizing labour costs, leading to increased employee turnover and poorly managed stores. With less traffic coming into stores, expectations from those brave enough to venture out are significantly higher, and retailers must invest in their teams if they want to stay relevant. They could borrow from a Toronto bike store’s playbook that saw revenues double during COVID-19, the owners recently told me. Open less than 18 months, the Dismount Bike Shop team built a reputation for cutting-edge merchandise selection, precise product and industry knowledge and outstanding customer experience. When the crisis hit, the company’s seamless pivot to online bookings with well-organized physical appointments helped achieve 100 per cent conversion rates. Training is key Product and industry expertise are not negotiable. Fisher’s study found that retailers who train their front-line employees sell 125 per cent more than those that offer no training. To overcome the current COVID-19 sanitation requirements and foster an authentic human experience, retail workers must also demonstrate specific interpersonal soft skills. To do so within a no-touch situation means capitalizing on other senses to engage. From that initial eye contact and open body language to a warm welcome, empathetic and friendly communication is key. Companies that commit to training sales advisers to expertly sell products while demonstrating high levels of relationship-building skills won’t just attract and retain the best employees. They will also drive in-store sales and customer retention. It’s time to stop considering employees as a cost and stores as showrooms. Instead, retailers should invest in their in-store teams and train them to become revenue generators. The human touch will define who the winners will be post-coronavirus.

Partners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on our fraying social safety nets, fragile domestic and global food systems, and the unacceptable precarity faced by newcomers, front-line workers and those living on the economic margins. Newcomers — recent immigrants, refugees, undocumented workers and international students — are vital to the Canadian economy. We depend on them to provide access to the low-cost foods we have come to expect. But at the grocery checkout, we aren’t paying for the true costs incurred by the ways we grow, manufacture and globally distribute food. Read more: 100 days of coronavirus has sent shock waves through the food system Newcomers are often precariously employed and food insecure, and may not have access to the culturally appropriate foods and food practices key to building successful connections in their new communities. Addressing these barriers could help repair some of the cracks in the system. Newcomers in the food system Newcomers’ vulnerability is not innate, but created. They are often overlooked because they make up a largely racialized and often economically disadvantaged population. Newcomers have uncertain living circumstances and access to fewer social supports. They experience higher rates of food insecurity and occupy many of the most under-valued, high-risk, hidden and low-paying jobs in our food systems. People hold up signs during a demonstration in Montréal calling on the federal government to give residency status to migrant workers, on June 6, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes The Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) brings tens of thousands temporary foreign workers into Canada each year, mostly to work on farms. Protections for SAWP workers differ from one province to the next, but generally workers are exempt from regulations for minimum wage, overtime pay or maximum daily work hours, and cannot collect employment insurance even though they make contributions. Their visas are tied to one employer, making them vulnerable to abuse and job loss if they refuse unsafe work or submit a complaint. Moreover, migrant agricultural workers are viewed as low-skilled, easily replaceable labouring bodies, despite their demonstrable knowledge and skills. This adds to their invisibility. During the pandemic, the federal government deemed food workers in grocery stores, cafeterias and farms — many of them newcomers — as essential workers, and relaxed regulations to allow international students in these roles to work longer hours. On May 7, Trudeau announced a wage top-up for essential workers, but each province determines who will — and will not — receive this benefit. Financial and cultural food insecurity Ultimately, newcomers are situated at the fault lines of Canada’s social safety nets and food systems. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 at two meat-packing plants in Alberta, staffed mainly by temporary foreign workers and new immigrants, are cases in point. However, even before the pandemic, newcomers disproportionately experienced poverty and one of its main symptoms, food insecurity. Beyond the financial barriers to food access, newcomers are regularly unable to access culturally appropriate foods or practise culturally meaningful “foodways,” such as growing, sharing and selling food among their cultural and linguistic communities. Read more: Migrant workers face further social isolation and mental health challenges during coronavirus pandemic Secure access to culturally appropriate foods, or cultural food security, is an important, but unmeasured and largely unexplored component of food security. Cultural food security is key Emerging research, as well as our experience working with newcomer communities, suggests cultural food security is key to newcomers’ sense of identity and personhood, connection to linguistic and cultural communities, nutritional status and grounding in their new communities. We’ve found that settlement services and programming for newcomers, however, tend to focus on skills training and employment. They often overlook the ways that access to culturally meaningful food and traditional food practices are important to newcomers’ settlement. Moreover, popular depictions of healthy eating are typically Eurocentric and sometimes stigmatizing and offensive. Hanan Akash helps prepare a typical Syrian meal at The Newcomer Kitchen Project at the Depanneur restaurant in Toronto in July 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov Enabling newcomers to grow culturally diverse food is an opportunity to meet their needs, and to strengthen our food systems. Statistics Canada reports that newcomers start businesses, many of them food businesses. However, compassionate and just settlement support means that we must transform the dominant food system into one that embraces a focus on health, well-being and dignity for newcomers, rather than the commodity-driven, cheap food system. The Newcomer Kitchen in Toronto has helped newcomers access paid employment and culturally meaningful foods. But more can be done. For example, many newcomers arrive with agricultural knowledge and skills to grow culturally diverse foods, but the capital required to begin production is prohibitive. Assisting newcomers to enter the agricultural sector as owners and operators, rather than as seasonal workers is one way that Canada could address the barriers newcomers face in accessing culturally appropriate food. Ultimately, policy and program options that address financial and other barriers for newcomers to culturally appropriate foods and food practices are needed to repair the cracks in our social safety nets and the food systems that COVID-19 has brought into the spotlight for many Canadians.

Partners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Investors are pushing companies to develop environmental plans, consider the social impacts of their operations and improve the integrity of how they are governed to ensure that women, workers and all stakeholders are fairly represented. In other words, environmental, social and governance policies — ESG for short — are now important business considerations. ESG proponents argue that when companies place importance on reducing their carbon footprint, emphasizing workplace management or improving board diversity, they are doing good business that will generate greater long-term financial returns for their investors. ESG investors base their objectives on achieving competitive financial returns along with one or more of the following: The belief that ESG principles can help companies contribute to investment returns through long-term value creation. Their values are consistent with the investments they hold. For example, those with strong views against nuclear energy will not invest in any mining or utility company involved in nuclear power. Investments should make a positive impact on the world. Extending the previous example, an ESG investor would buy shares in green energy companies, ultimately wishing to see those companies replace carbon-based energy sources. How successful are ESG investors? If ESG projects impact business performance, then it stands to reason that they should help drive financial returns. Many academic and industry studies have looked into this, however, and there is no conclusive evidence that ESG investing leads to superior returns for investors. There is, however, evidence that ESG stock portfolios using negative screens (for example, by eliminating questionable companies such as tobacco producers or gun manufacturers) produce lower returns. Finance theory shows that a well-diversified portfolio reduces risk without affecting returns. Eliminating stocks, especially entire industries, from a portfolio leads to a less diversified portfolio and therefore higher risks with the same return, or lower returns with the same risk. There is also evidence that morally questionable companies, divested by ESG investors, see their stock prices initially fall, but earn higher returns for their non-ESG investors going forward. Studies also suggest that stock prices do not fully reflect the value of intangible assets, which include sustainability initiatives. In this case, ESG investors that identify such intangible assets and buy those undervalued stocks should logically earn superior returns once the market recognizes the stock’s true worth and efficiently values those assets into the company’s stock price. Research indicates this occurs to some degree. How to determine ESG measures There is concern within the investment community that there is no standard definition of what comprises ESG measures. Take the case below. There are two lists, with data from Capital IQ. One is the 10 largest investments in a large, established American ESG mutual fund, while the other is the largest 10 companies in the S&P 500 index. Which list, A or B, represents the ESG fund? List A List B Microsoft Apple Apple Microsoft Amazon.com Amazon.com Visa Alphabet Danaher Corp. Facebook Adobe Berkshire Hathaway BlackRock Visa Thermo Fisher Scientific Johnson & Johnson Fidelity National Info Services Walmart Bank of America JPMorgan Chase You can forgive yourself if you had difficulty choosing the correct list. It’s list A. Four of the ESG mutual fund’s top 10 holdings are the same as the S&P 500 index’s top 10 holdings. In another example, a well-established Canadian ESG fund includes Suncor Energy, the largest oilsands producer, as one of its top investments. Well-known financial services firms such as MSCI, S&P Global and FTSE Russell rate companies for their handling of ESG issues. It is big business. Portfolio managers then use those ratings to identify which firms should be considered for their ESG portfolios. In 2018, MSCI ranked electric car-maker Tesla No. 1 in ESG for auto manufacturers, while FTSE Russell ranked Tesla last on its ESG auto ratings. This is an example of how subjective these ratings are. The obvious problem is that it leaves investors in the dark about whether Tesla is in fact an ESG-positive company. Is Tesla an ESG-conscious company? Depends on who you ask. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) Recently, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission announced it has launched an investigation and “… wants to know whether money managers are engaging in false advertising by saying funds are devoted to doing good when the reality is much murkier,” according to Bloomberg. Unintended consequences To the extent that companies successfully carry out their ESG plans, positive environmental or social outcomes can occur. There may, however, be unintended consequences. Vincent Deluard, a director at INTL FCStone Inc., a financial advisory firm, found that companies that are likely to do well on ESG scores typically produce more revenue and higher profit margins with few employees, are often found in higher human capital sectors such as health care or information technology. Shareholders may get rich with these companies, but they do little to improve the lot of the average hourly wage earner. He writes: “ESG investing was originally designed as a response to the flaws of capitalism, as a way to turn the profit motive in a force for good. However, ESG filters (unintentionally) reward the greatest illnesses of post-industrial societies: winner-take-all capitalism, monopolistic concentration, and the disappearance of jobs for normal people.” The average market capitalization per employee of the 10 ESG stocks (in List A above) is US$6.4 million per employee, while the S&P 500 company average is US$3.6 million. While this is simply anecdotal evidence, it is consistent with Deluard’s findings. Is investing for competitive financial returns based on ESG principles like searching for fool’s gold? We can say the intent is noble, and the actions are sincere, but the execution is simply not developed enough to deliver the types of benefits socially responsible investments claim to deliver.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Around the world, biodiversity is dropping precipitously. In North America, about three billion birds have been lost over recent decades and amphibian populations are declining at a rate of about four per cent per year. Globally, insects are vanishing at a rate of about nine per cent per decade. This is distressing for nature lovers. It is also worrying on a practical level: in agricultural landscapes, wild species perform many important activities such as pollination and control of insect pests. A highly effective way to reduce biodiversity losses in agricultural regions is to increase the amount of natural and semi-natural habitats such as forests, hedgerows, prairie strips and other non-crop areas. This has led to various government incentives for farmers to leave some areas out of production. But there are limits to how much land farmers can leave for biodiversity, while foregoing opportunities for crop production. The benefit of small crop fields Small fields can help. Farmers can maintain or increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by planting their crops in smaller fields. For example, instead of planting two large fields, they could plant eight small fields, keeping the same total amount of land in production. Note that this is not about the size of a farm, but about the average size of crop fields. A very large farm could, in theory, be composed of a very large number of small fields, where a “field” is an area in a particular crop type, such as a corn field or a hay field. Adjacent areas in the same crop type are separate fields if they are divided by even a narrow bit of non-field such as a hedgerow, a fence line, a track or a ditch. My colleagues and I have found remarkably consistent increases in biodiversity with decreasing average field size, across eight very different agricultural regions in five countries — and for a wide array of wildlife types. The number of species of plants, pollinators including bees, butterflies and syrphid flies, and pest-eating wildlife such as spiders, carabid beetles, birds, frogs and bats, all increase with decreasing average field size. For example, biodiversity is about 50 per cent higher when the average field size drops to two hectares from eight hectares. Pest-eating wildlife, such as this carabid beetle, can benefit crops. (Shutterstock) In fact, the benefit to biodiversity of reducing crop field sizes appears to be greater than two other commonly suggested methods for increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes — reducing pesticide use and increasing crop diversity, the number of different crop types grown in a landscape. The best of both worlds One question is whether the increased biodiversity is due to the additional non-cropped strips of semi-natural land, such as hedgerows, between fields. In other words, is there actually less cropland — and more semi-natural land — in an agricultural landscape with eight small fields than in a landscape with two large ones? Our research shows that in fact biodiversity is higher in a landscape with smaller crop fields, even for the same total amount of natural and semi-natural habitat, including all the little pieces such as hedgerows. Small strips of natural and semi-natural habitat, like this hedgerow, can provide wildlife with an area for food, breeding or an escape from farming operations. (Shutterstock) We don’t know yet why biodiversity is higher in landscapes with smaller crop fields. One possibility is that when crop fields are smaller, the natural habitats are closer together. This would increase the ability of wildlife to easily access natural habitats from crop fields. Crop fields may provide temporary food sources for wildlife, such as when a crop is in flower or when there is a pest outbreak. Natural areas are also needed for breeding and overwintering sites and for escape from farming operations such as plowing. When wildlife can easily move back and forth between crops and natural spaces, perhaps they have access to the best of both worlds. The farmer’s dilemma Altogether, our research suggests a “many small” approach to support biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. But can farmers readily reduce the sizes of fields? In many parts of the world, just the opposite has been happening over the past 50 years. Fields are being consolidated by removing the tracks, fences, stone walls and hedgerows that once separated them. Farmers do this to increase the efficiency of their operations. But in doing so, they reduce the populations of wildlife that help support agriculture. The net cost or benefit to farmers of reducing field sizes while maintaining the same area in production has not yet been studied. But the benefits to biodiversity are now clear.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The coronavirus pandemic has prompted retailers to ask customers to wear masks, maintain physical distancing and avoid the use of cash when possible. Despite scientific evidence indicating that currency doesn’t transmit COVID-19, there continues to be an unprecedented weariness around the use of cash altogether. At the peak of the global pandemic, banks in China and South Korea began disinfecting and quarantining bank notes to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Other central banks have refused to adopt such measures, communicating that risks posed by handling cash are low compared to other objects that are frequently touched, such as PIN pads. The Bank of Canada, for example, encouraged retailers to stop refusing cash because it could disproportionately affect those who are dependent on cash as a form of payment. Despite such assurances, fear of transmitting the virus could accelerate the trend of digital payment apps and reduce the use of cash in society. Although digital payment systems such as Apple Pay, Venmo and Google Pay have become much more widespread in recent years, these payment apps were not meant to replace existing currency. These apps also haven’t substantially reduced the amount of cash in circulation. Cashless in a crisis The Bank for International Settlements, which advises central banks around the world, released a bulletin in April that said the pandemic could speed up the shift toward digital payments around the world, including central bank digital currencies. That’s not a surprise. A global crisis can often act as a catalyst for structural change. For instance, the 2009 Västberga heist led to a cashless society in Sweden. As a string of robberies occurred in shops, banks and even buses, Sweden moved to reduce cash circulation as a way to protect workers. Cash use in Sweden has since been on the decline, from 39 per cent in 2010 to 13 per cent in 2018. Currently about 20 per cent of retailers in the country no longer accept cash. Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, announced in 2017 that it would initiate a pilot program exploring the viability of a national digital currency called the e-krona. The Riksbank recently launched a joint project with Accenture to determine the technical aspects of the e-krona. The only details released so far indicate the digital currency will use blockchain technology. However, previous reports from the pilot concluded the e-krona would be centrally managed, ensuring the central bank would have firm control over money supply. China’s digital currency trials China recently launched a pilot program of its digital yuan in four major cities, but details of the national digital currency are scarce. A Chinese national flag flutters in front of the People’s Bank of China in Beijing. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) The digital yuan is backed by China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and pegged to the national currency. This sovereign digital currency is unlikely to resemble traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which support decentralization and are not issued or managed by a central authority. The Chinese digital currency allegedly uses asymmetric cryptography (public/private keys) and smart contracts, which allows for controllable anonymity and the prevention of counterfeiting. The centralized design of the digital yuan would provide the Chinese government with unmatched oversight over money flows and transactions. Moreover, the People’s Bank of China has filed over 50 patents related to the digital yuan and plans to distribute the digital currency through commercial banks. The bank is also exploring a tracking system that would trace the digital currency’s movement. The timing of the digital yuan launching comes when the rest of the world is cutting interest rates and dealing with the global pandemic, providing China with an unusual opportunity. The objective of the digital yuan is to increase its circulation, with the end goal of becoming a global currency much like the U.S. dollar. China also aims to beat private competitors, such as Facebook’s Libra, by maintaining control over the country’s financial security. China believes digital currencies that are not issued by governments or central banks are a threat to sovereignty. Digital currency coming to Canada? The Bank of Canada appears to have a strong interest in rethinking the nature of cash and reinventing the role of central banking. A recent job posting at the central bank indicated it would be “embarking on a program of major social significance” by designing and presumably deploying its own central bank digital currency system. Like other central banks around the world, the Bank of Canada may be considering the creation of a digital currency system. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld The proposed digital currency would protect user privacy, but it would not provide the same anonymity as cash transactions. It’s intended to be accessible, indicating the digital currency could be used by all Canadians, even those who don’t have a bank account or a mobile phone. Many countries have been experimenting with digital currencies since the growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency emerged. As central banks attempt to enter the race of developing digital currencies, governments must first examine whether such a move will actually help the economy. Citizens must also think critically before jumping on board because national digital currencies have serious privacy implications. There seems to be some leeway with introducing change during a crisis, as the experiments in China and Sweden display. But the introduction of a digital currency during a crisis could provide governments with frightening new powers. The role of the state could drastically change as nations shift towards a cashless society, which encourages central banks to adapt in order to maintain firm control over money supply.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger This story is part of a series that proposes solutions to the many issues exposed during the coronavirus pandemic and what government and citizens can do to make Canada a better place. The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t stopped the flow of goods coming into Canada. That’s because countries around the world worked together to keep trade markets open for business. But Canada faces a potential crisis if its borders remain closed to people for a prolonged period of time. Canadian governments, regardless of the party in power, have traditionally increased immigration numbers as a strategy to offset the country’s declining domestic birthrate. A continual flow of immigrants is essential for economic stability and growth. Click here for more articles from this ongoing series How then can you maintain economic growth if no new immigrants are allowed into the country? Every crisis can lead to new opportunities. And we’ve already seen challenges that emerged during the pandemic lead to innovative government programs. The same should happen with Canada’s immigration policy. While the pandemic has temporarily closed the territorial borders to all foreigners for non-essential travel, there’s an opportunity to keep our “virtual” borders open to the best and brightest workers who want to come to Canada. One million new immigrants by 2021 The current immigration plan calls for more than one million new permanent residents between 2019 and 2021. Of these newcomers, the majority will be economic migrants, coming through various provincial and federal programs such as the Federal Skilled Worker Class and the Provincial Nominee Program. Illustrating the vital role of immigration for Canada, with emphasis on economic gain and global competitiveness, Canada’s then minister of immigration, Ahmed Hussen, stated in 2018: “The new multi-year immigration levels plan supports Canadian employers and businesses by ensuring they have the skilled labour they need to spur innovation and help to keep our country at the forefront of the global economy.” This graphic from the government of Canada explains how immigration policy is linked to economic growth. (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) Some of the dilemmas that Canada will face in the post-pandemic recovery period will involve how to continue attracting the best and brightest, what sectors of the economy should be prioritized and how to deal with essential work like agriculture. Unprecedented challenges I have studied highly skilled and lower-skilled migration in Europe and internationally for over 20 years, with a special interest in how migration policy interacts with other sectors such as agriculture, the care industry and the competition for talent. But the COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for Canada’s immigration policy because of the level of uncertainty that the whole world is facing. What’s happened to the government’s plans to attract “the best and brightest from around the world” — people who will be fundamental to the country’s economic future? For more than three months, Canada has temporarily stopped processing work permit or permanent residency applications. This presents many challenges for businesses and for workers and their families. While working remotely is a possibility for most highly skilled workers in Canada who are in non-essential sectors, that’s not an option for those who have a job offer but are still abroad. They cannot receive a work permit, a Social Insurance Number unless they enter the country. They also can’t be paid without a SIN number. There are important consequences for organizations that seek workarounds and do not respect labour laws. Digital work permits Technology can offer a solution to this impasse. A security-proof digital work permit and a social identification number could be assigned remotely to allow these “virtual immigrants” to start working remotely with their Canadian employers while they wait for the entry ban to be lifted. Citizenship Judge Rania Sfeir, centre, speaks to new Canadian citizens on Canada Day 2020 during a virtual citizenship ceremony held over livestream due to the COVID-19 pandemic. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang The permit could be for three or six months and would automatically be replaced by the regular work permit and SIN if the ban is lifted and the worker moves to Canada. The worker and employer would commit to honouring their contract by coming to Canada within 90 days of lifting the entry restrictions. This would give everyone — government, employers, workers and their families — both the necessary guarantees and flexibility to deal with this unexpected disruption. But are those workers truly needed now — especially given the country’s record unemployment rate since the outbreak of the pandemic? Canadian immigration policy involves long-term planning related to the country’s demographic composition, growth (or rather decline, without immigration), key industries and efforts to attract new immigrants to the smaller regional centres across this vast country. In February, just before the pandemic was declared, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino told the Canadian Club in Toronto that Canada welcomed 341,000 new immigrants last year. He then added: “In 2020, the future of Canada hinges on immigration.” But the current situations means it seems unlikely Canada will be able to meet its immigration targets this year or next. Not a job competition Unemployment and underemployment data from April show temporary workers, those with less than one year at their last job or people not covered by a union or collective agreement, were hit the hardest by COVID-19. While it is imperative to provide for these workers and their families, these newly unemployed workers are not in competition for the same jobs as those to be filled by the highly skilled newcomers attracted by the Express Entry or Global Talent immigration streams. As we go through and hopefully leave behind the pandemic, Canada needs to build a stronger health sector including industries that produce gowns, masks and gloves or health-care equipment like ventilators. The medical and pharmaceutical research sector should also remain a top priority. Transnational co-operation is key to Canadian entrepreneurship. Such sectors can only gain from highly skilled migrants who bring to the country innovative ideas, much needed skills and connections to other countries and continents. New ideas needed While rethinking policies about bringing highly skilled immigrants to Canada, new ideas are also needed for lower-skilled workers who are essential to the economy. Demonstrators outside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s constituency office in Montréal on June 6 called on the government to give residency status to migrant workers as the COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada and around the world. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes The deaths of Mexican farm workers in southern Ontario have raised an important debate about the responsibility of employers, but also the need for monitoring the health and the working conditions of those we bring to Canada to do jobs that are essential. There has been a growing awareness that the temporary foreign worker program in agriculture needs both a short- and long-term overhaul. We need to consider how agricultural policy and migration policy can work hand in hand to promote better working and living conditions for migrant farm workers. One idea could be the expansion of a pilot project launched in May that will allow a small number of migrant agriculture workers to apply for permanent residency. The many challenges that both highly skilled and low skilled migrants face during the pandemic can be turned into an opportunity that would help Canada’s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger All over the world, architects and engineers are crafting cutting-edge skyscrapers from one of the most renewable and sustainable materials available to humanity — wood. For the time being, the tallest wooden building in the world is the Mjøstårnet, an 18-storey building north of Oslo that houses offices, hotel rooms and apartments, and stands just over 85 metres in height. Canada has several tall wooden towers, including Brock Commons at the University of British Columbia (18 storeys; 58 metres) and the Origine eco-condo development in Québec City (13 storeys). A number of other projects, such as the 10-storey Arbour at George Brown College’s Waterfront Campus, are under development. For some, wood may seem an archaic and even dangerous choice for tall building construction compared to modern alternatives like concrete, steel and glass. But as emissions associated with tall buildings continue to rise, governments at all levels are looking for low-carbon, low-energy alternatives. In Canada, buildings account for 12.7 per cent of national greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, buildings lead to 40 per cent of total emissions. For Canada, a country with abundant wood resources, investing in new tall wooden building construction is an opportunity for sustainable economic growth — but challenges remain. Not your average log cabin Today’s tall wooden buildings are different from the two-by-four wood framing usually seen in single-family homes or two- to four-storey condominium structures. So-called “mass timber” construction is derived from old techniques of post-and-beam construction, but uses advanced technologies, including cross-laminated timbers (CLT) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), which feature layers of wood bonded with adhesives and produced as either beams or panels. Some concrete and steel may be used around elevator shafts or stairwells in mass timber construction, but floors and beams may be made entirely of wood. Structural wood products like CLT have a number of advantages in tall wooden building consruction: they are lighter than conventional materials, require less energy to make than either steel or concrete (and thus produce lower emissions), and can sequester carbon. The Mjösa Tower (Mjøstårnet) in Brumunddal, Norway, is — for now — the world’s tallest wooden building. Their relative lightness makes it possible to assemble floor and wall sections off-site and ship them to the build site, significantly reducing the amount of building time required. For example, the on-site construction for the Origine project in Québec City was completed in only four months. Adopting tall wooden construction could greatly reduce the amount of disruption — dust, noise and traffic disruptions, for example - that construction brings to the urban landscape. Building better, faster and greener Prefabrication also means that building structures can be designed to maximize energy efficiency since individual components can be built precisely in a factory, minimizing errors and ensuring that measurements are exact. Tall wooden buildings store carbon, preventing it from entering the atmosphere by sequestering it in the building for decades. In contrast, buildings made of steel and concrete generate large amounts of carbon emissions per tonne of material produced. UBC’s Brock Commons floor structure contains cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels supported on glue-laminated timber (glulam) columns. The prefabricated panels shortened the on-site construction time. (KK Law/Naturally Wood/UBC), CC BY-NC For example, the Brock Commons at UBC sequesters an estimated 1,753 tonnes of CO2. Research suggests that tall wooden buildings have a 20 per cent reduction in both their carbon and energy footprints. These types of buildings could be important in helping Canada, and many other countries around the world, achieve net zero performance measures related to energy efficiency and overall carbon emissions that will be required in meeting future climate goals. Clear-cut solution? The perception remains that tall wooden buildings less resistant to fire than a typical concrete and steel building. But the designs of these buildings meet stringent fire codes. The U.S. National Fire Protection Association, in collaboration with Canada’s National Research Council, recently delivered a series of reports on the fire risk associated with tall wooden buildings, with particular focus on the behaviour of cross-laminated timbers or laminated veneer lumber. Overall, their findings showed that tall wooden buildings can meet the minimum two-hour fire protection ratings required by most jurisdictions, if proper fireproofing materials and sprinklers are incorporated into the design. In the event of fire, the design minimizes danger in early stages, allowing inhabitants to escape and the fire to be brought under control. Another challenge tall wooden buildings face is the environmental impact they may have on forests. If wood is not sourced from sustainable, responsibly managed forests, any benefit derived from the building itself would be offset by increased deforestation and habitat loss. A number of tools, like the certification programs run by the Forest Stewardship Council or the Programme for the Endorsement of Wood Certification provide important third-party verification that forest harvests are done within a sustainable management regime; these schemes are constantly being reviewed to consider all aspects of forest sustainability, including carbon depletion in forest soils and impacts biodiversity. As tall wooden buildings take off, it is critical that the wood used in construction be sourced in an increasingly sustainable fashion. Tall wooden buildings are likely to play an increasingly important role in our carbon mitigation strategies. Recent work suggests that shifting to wooden construction could act as an ever-increasing carbon sink, allowing more and more carbon to be sequestered safely in useful applications. The crown for the tallest wood building will be hard to keep. In Tokyo, a proposal for a 350-metre tall, 70-storey building is currently vying for the title. As architects, engineers and tradespeople become comfortable with these materials, tall wooden buildings will increasingly become a part of the urban landscape around the world.

However, the threat posed by the possibility of a second wave remains very real. Historical and contemporary forms of colonialism predispose First Nations to increased risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As researchers and experts in human rights and Indigenous Peoples’ rights, we argue that the landmark 2016 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision in the case between the federal government and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations sets the legal standard for Canada in the provision and funding of services to address COVID-19. Canada’s funding measures to date to address the risk of an outbreak do not meet this standard. From White Plague to COVID-19 On Nov. 15, 1907, a headline in the Ottawa Evening Citizen stated, “Schools Aid White Plague: Surprising Death Rolls Among Indians Revealed.

In the century that followed, many other credible voices, such as the Auditor General of Canada and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, denounced the inequality in public services to First Nations and proposed solutions to address it. Canada has failed to act. Canada’s failure to take adequate action has resulted in disparities, including in access to housing, health care and safe drinking water. These inequalities increase the risks to First Nations in health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Confusing instructions For example, while public health authorities consider hand-washing to be the most effective way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, many First Nations communities on reserves still lack access to clean, safe water. The chronic housing crisis also exacerbates the situation. Nearly one-quarter (23.1 per cent) of First Nations people living on-reserve are in overcrowded housing, which prevents families from following public health guidelines regarding physical distancing and isolation of the sick. It also puts women and children at risk of domestic violence. These structural inequities, combined with discrimination in access to health care, healthy and affordable food and effective telecommunications infrastructure, severely limit First Nations’ ability to respond to health crises. Legal standards The pandemic poses distinct and unforeseen challenges in First Nations communities across Canada. Yet there are valuable lessons to be learned from past experiences. The tribunal’s 2016 decision, which deals with government services for First Nations children, clarifies the legal standard that Canada must meet in order to fulfil its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). First, the decision establishes that Canada must provide sufficient funding to enable the provision of services that take into account the needs and cultural, historical and geographic distinctiveness of different communities. Second, the additional costs associated with responding to emerging public health crises cannot be offset by reducing existing services and programs for First Nations. Finally, measures taken in the context of the pandemic will invariably prove to be useless if they are not accompanied by effective strategies to address inequalities in government services and programs for First Nations in a comprehensive manner. Inequitable measures As of June 25, Canada’s specific measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in First Nations communities in Canada represent less than one per cent of the federal government’s funding to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, even though First Nations represent nearly five per cent of the population of Canada. In other words, the measures do not meet even the modest standard of formal equality. In addition, the federal government has yet to announce measures to address the systemic inequalities experienced by First Nations communities that predispose them to increased risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Dr. Bryce pointed out 113 years ago, effective public health care interventions for First Nations must include remedial action and substantive equality in the delivery of public services. One without the other is doomed to failure. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde addresses reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick For decades, Canada has been aware of the inequities in funding for First Nations services and programs, but has not acted. According to evidence presented before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2005, the federal government estimated that it provided at least 22 per cent less funding to First Nations for children’s services compared to funding for other children. Instead, the federal government has encouraged First Nations to be patient as it makes negligible changes to inequitable government services for First Nations. Indeed, the tribunal had to issue nine orders after its landmark 2016 decision in order to hold Canada to its legal obligations to First Nations children. In the case of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations against the Government of Canada, the Human Rights Tribunal ruled that it is illegal for Canada to put financial considerations ahead of the best interests of First Nations children. The decision echoes what First Nations people have long asserted: that discrimination as a tax policy is a manifestation of racism and colonialism rooted in Canadian society. If there is one thing we have learned from Canada’s response to the pandemic crisis, it is that various levels of government can move quickly to deliver billions of dollars in social programs and economic support when they are deemed priorities. If substantive equality is not seen as an immediate policy objective in government programs and services, Canada’s colonialist policies will once again have predictable and fatal consequences for First Nations people.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger It’s the most famous city slogan in the world: I Love New York. And yet, surprisingly, love doesn’t seem to play a part in how urban planners build cities. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future for cities looks dire. Urban areas may empty, and the death of urban density might bring an end to mass public transit, storefronts on streets, kids jostling in schools, parks and playgrounds, and festivals in the park. Throughout the modern history of urban planning, high-density living has been seen as dangerous. And with or without a global pandemic, living in dense cities carries risks, from disease to social conflict. In cities, the sheer number of people in a concentrated space poses challenges to containing the coronavirus pandemic. (Shutterstock) For some leaders, love has played a major part in the management of this pandemic. British Columbia’s Medical Health Officer Bonnie Henry refers to the need to “be kind.” And New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s March 24 coronavirus news briefing earned him a new moniker as the “Love Gov” when he said: “We’re going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you. New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That’s why I love New York.” The time-tested ratio of urban risk and reward Urban planners who study and design cities often explain them through growth, power, efficiency and grandeur. We have Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier, with his Radiant City, Robert Moses as the “power broker” and Harvey Molotch and his “growth machine” theory. The discipline of regional science emerged in the 1960s to render the study of cities more serious and less personal, and interest has again surged in the creation of a “science of cities.” Urban researchers Andrew Zitcer and Robert Lake, however, have asked: “What might it mean for a planner to love the people and communities that are the subject of planning?” But what would it mean for all urban planners to confess to their love for the places they plan? And why? As American philosopher Charles Peirce said, radical love — not competition, conflicts or challenge — is “the great evolutionary agency of the universe….” According to urbanist Libby Porter, radical love is key to decolonizing planning. One of the possibilities that opens up for urban planning when decolonized is the possibility of more explicit and even reciprocal consideration of love as method and as purpose of planning. As a colonial practice, urban planning has always been about taking a long-term view. Decolonized urban planning, as viewed by Indigenous planners, goes further in considering planning for cities whose future residents we already love, and planning to make a gift of the city to them. Decolonized urban planning permits us to think about cities loving us back. The three types of love for a city Different kinds of love feed and starve our cities. This shows up in the way urbanites of many stripes are motivated differently for the work they do. In Voices of Decline, city lover Robert A. Beauregard writes: “I grew up when the cities were dying.” He exemplifies the necrophiliac urbanist who loves cities when it seems no one else will, especially the dying parts of cities, the desperate and forgotten places of decline, disinvestment and blight. They seek to offer dignity, a sense of rights and a voice to the marginalized. Others — optophiliacs — fall in love with the city because the city opens their eyes. In cities, optophiliacs see how richness in diversity and density overfills their cups with creative potential — best exemplified by urbanist Richard Florida’s theory of the creative class. They define urban success as a city dense with independent, multitudinous creative pursuits of all kinds. Then there are the plutophiliacs, whose love for the city begins and ends with their love for money and the creation of private wealth. Some critics call them disaster capitalists. Cities and the love of money These three different varieties of urban love act as rivals for the city’s favour and the forms that this takes in the urban form, function and structure. Necrophiliac love focuses on the city’s life-support systems for the sake of the most vulnerable — its economic base, basic democratic institutions, transportation system. While Georges-Eugène Haussmann, master urban planner of Paris in the mid-19th century, was celebrated for sanitary works that saved the city from plague, necrophiliac city lovers Marshall Berman and Neil Smith derided “Haussmannization” as the obliteration of the urban commons in favour of capitalist modernity. They suspected the sanitary planning works were a plutophilic plot to clear the slums and prevent uprisings. Optophiliac city lovers, who express their creative love through the arts, culture and the finer details that make city life worth living, find themselves particularly scorned during this pandemic. With local shops, galleries and creative venues of all kinds shut down, boarded up and verboten, it is as if the city they love is being stolen right out of the hands they have been using to sculpt it. While sometimes shrugged off in times of crisis like this as being non-essential, the laments of the optophiles for the cities they are losing are real, too. When the arts sector scrambles to generate ways to engage and show their work to others, despite the pandemic restrictions against gathering, this is not only an effort to earn a living — these optophiliac urbanists are fighting against a cultural retreat with far-reaching implications for cities as “the most human of all things,” as Claude Lévi-Strauss averred in Tristes Tropiques. Plutophiliac urban lovers are the ones that cities seem both to love best, and love to hate. All of that sad dark stuff about the city we see in the present pandemic — it is their black gold. When business and political leaders rally support for cities as a necessary part of the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is a plutophiliac love they are invoking. As in previous disasters gone by, they are busy devising new ways to create what they love from the wreckage, and that is private wealth. Cities have an opportunity now to think about how love can shape the post-pandemic world. (Shutterstock.) In a spirit of loving attachment to our cities, we can see these different varieties of love as offering entirely different risks, and different reciprocal gifts that our cities are likely to give back, as we recover from the pandemic. In the rich mix of urban density and diversity that inhabits all our cities, our love takes all three shapes of: a lifeline, a fount of inspiration, a cash cow. The coronavirus has brought these different stakes in the city into sharp focus. If we can summon the courage to profess our love for the city, although it is dangerous, now as throughout history we may be better able to hone our plans so that the city of the future will love us back.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Around the world, biodiversity is dropping precipitously. In North America, about three billion birds have been lost over recent decades and amphibian populations are declining at a rate of about four per cent per year. Globally, insects are vanishing at a rate of about nine per cent per decade. This is distressing for nature lovers. It is also worrying on a practical level: in agricultural landscapes, wild species perform many important activities such as pollination and control of insect pests. A highly effective way to reduce biodiversity losses in agricultural regions is to increase the amount of natural and semi-natural habitats such as forests, hedgerows, prairie strips and other non-crop areas. This has led to various government incentives for farmers to leave some areas out of production. But there are limits to how much land farmers can leave for biodiversity, while foregoing opportunities for crop production. The benefit of small crop fields Small fields can help. Farmers can maintain or increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by planting their crops in smaller fields. For example, instead of planting two large fields, they could plant eight small fields, keeping the same total amount of land in production. Note that this is not about the size of a farm, but about the average size of crop fields. A very large farm could, in theory, be composed of a very large number of small fields, where a “field” is an area in a particular crop type, such as a corn field or a hay field. Adjacent areas in the same crop type are separate fields if they are divided by even a narrow bit of non-field such as a hedgerow, a fence line, a track or a ditch. My colleagues and I have found remarkably consistent increases in biodiversity with decreasing average field size, across eight very different agricultural regions in five countries — and for a wide array of wildlife types. The number of species of plants, pollinators including bees, butterflies and syrphid flies, and pest-eating wildlife such as spiders, carabid beetles, birds, frogs and bats, all increase with decreasing average field size. For example, biodiversity is about 50 per cent higher when the average field size drops to two hectares from eight hectares. Pest-eating wildlife, such as this carabid beetle, can benefit crops. (Shutterstock) In fact, the benefit to biodiversity of reducing crop field sizes appears to be greater than two other commonly suggested methods for increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes — reducing pesticide use and increasing crop diversity, the number of different crop types grown in a landscape. The best of both worlds One question is whether the increased biodiversity is due to the additional non-cropped strips of semi-natural land, such as hedgerows, between fields. In other words, is there actually less cropland — and more semi-natural land — in an agricultural landscape with eight small fields than in a landscape with two large ones? Our research shows that in fact biodiversity is higher in a landscape with smaller crop fields, even for the same total amount of natural and semi-natural habitat, including all the little pieces such as hedgerows. Small strips of natural and semi-natural habitat, like this hedgerow, can provide wildlife with an area for food, breeding or an escape from farming operations. (Shutterstock) We don’t know yet why biodiversity is higher in landscapes with smaller crop fields. One possibility is that when crop fields are smaller, the natural habitats are closer together. This would increase the ability of wildlife to easily access natural habitats from crop fields. Crop fields may provide temporary food sources for wildlife, such as when a crop is in flower or when there is a pest outbreak. Natural areas are also needed for breeding and overwintering sites and for escape from farming operations such as plowing. When wildlife can easily move back and forth between crops and natural spaces, perhaps they have access to the best of both worlds. The farmer’s dilemma Altogether, our research suggests a “many small” approach to support biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. But can farmers readily reduce the sizes of fields? In many parts of the world, just the opposite has been happening over the past 50 years. Fields are being consolidated by removing the tracks, fences, stone walls and hedgerows that once separated them. Farmers do this to increase the efficiency of their operations. But in doing so, they reduce the populations of wildlife that help support agriculture. The net cost or benefit to farmers of reducing field sizes while maintaining the same area in production has not yet been studied. But the benefits to biodiversity are now clear.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have catalyzed calls for organizations to do more to address systemic racism in our midst. In response, many organizations have issued solidarity statements and committed to meaningful action. Bookstores have seen a spike in demand for anti-racism titles, while organizational leaders scramble to find workshops, webinars and training to offer their employees on the topic of racial bias. Among the different forms of diversity training, a popular offering addresses the concept of implicit racial bias. Implicit biases are automatic, outside of our conscious awareness, and influence us despite our best intentions. Since the concept of implicit prejudice was first introduced in 1995, implicit bias has permeated almost all aspects of equity, diversity and inclusion training in multiple sectors. Implicit bias training entered the mainstream when Starbucks closed its stores to offer employees the training in 2018. Over time, a lucrative industry has developed around corporate bias training. Bias has become big business because some profit-driven consultants offer training as an easy fix. As part of a team that has studied bias training for years, I have extensively researched how it influences individuals and organizations. We have found that while bias training may be useful to start a conversation, there may be unintended consequences. For example, bringing biases into awareness for learners can trigger negative and defensive emotional reactions. Another problem is that bias training is perceived as an easy fix but addressing systemic racism is much more complicated. When and how bias training works A review of diversity training found that less than half of the interventions showed some improvement. Another review found only 30 studies and did not show any long-term change in outcomes. Bias training can also lead to a defensive backlash, triggering tension, identity compartmentalization and negative emotions such as shame. Another problem is that bias is baked into the fabric of our organizations and society at large. Any educational intervention directed toward individuals without appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of bias in our society will ultimately fail. Placing the onus on individuals to address widespread organizational inequities can contribute to a sense of futility and helplessness. In our research, we found that bias training is only effective if it is designed as one component of a larger multipronged approach. To be effective, bias training must be adapted to particular contexts and settings. (Clay Banks/Unsplash) First, any bias training must be designed with context and professional identity in mind. For example, our initial training was tailored to a specific work unit in a hospital. When we attempted to transfer the same training to other contexts, it was not as effective. When requests were made to apply the training to other contexts we advised that research and engagement would be necessary to understand why bias training was needed and how bias was perceived in that context. Second, bias training is more effective when people work and train together. Training was less effective if doctors and nurses learn separately, and more effective when they work through relevant cases in a collaborative way. Training in teams also helps individuals feel comfortable opening up about their biases and accepting their vulnerabilities. Training that enhances collaboration and openness leads to social reinforcement of behavioural change. Third, sustaining the effects of training requires tangible changes in policy and visible support of organizational leaders. Rather than focus exclusively on training others, leaders must look within their own approaches to equity and diversity. Leaders who model a more inclusive approach and integrate bias training with other initiatives to enhance inclusion and belonging within their organization will be more successful than those who rely on training alone. Read more: Starbucks and the impact of implicit bias training Lastly, we must humble ourselves and realize that single training sessions are unlikely to produce meaningful learning outcomes for participants. Rather than singular curricular interventions, approaches should include opportunities to refresh and repeat key messages with attention to sustainable behavioural change over time. Racial bias is not something that we can measure and fix through training alone. There are no boxes we can check or certificate we can complete to fix systemic racism. Advancing justice and equity requires us to roll up our sleeves and do the work. Each day we must confront our biased selves in the mirror and work hard to examine how biases manifest through our behaviours, policies and organizational practices. But reflection alone will not fix anything. We must collectively change the biased norms within our organizations and be prepared for the inevitable discomfort that accompanies changes to the status quo. Addressing racial bias is not just hard work, it is also messy work. We must accept that we will stumble along the way. Anti-racism is a journey, not a destination.

It’s difficult to apply a one-size-fits-all interpretation as to why certain states experienced higher numbers of infections while others kept theirs in check. For instance, Greece’s success in containing the virus was attributed to its stringent lockdown measures, Germany’s lower death rate was linked to its well-developed health-care system while South Korea was commended for its wide-ranging testing.

(AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris) In Canada, there’s been criticism of the lack of preventative public health policies and the consequential difficulties dealing with the health impacts of the pandemic. Even when wide-scale testing infrastructure was put in place, testing rates remained low. Read more: The coronavirus shows we should treat public health the same as public works Different degrees of government intervention Generally speaking, there are three types of welfare states among western democracies: social democratic, liberal and conservative or corporatist. These tend to be characterized by various degrees of governmental intervention, universal or selective benefit plans and by different levels of welfare provisions. The liberal regimes contain the states of Canada, the United States, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, the only non-western liberal state. The northern European region captures the social democratic states of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and the Netherlands. And continental Europe includes the so-called called conservative or corporatist states: Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium. On the number of cases per million and the number of deaths per million — the only two variables that can illustrate the divergent testing approaches taken by individual nations — it appears that Canada fares better than the conservative states of continental Europe (Spain, Belgium, Switzerland or Italy) and even better than some social democratic nations (Iceland, Sweden and the Netherlands). However, when comparing Canada to similar liberal democracies, the country takes third place in relation to the number of cases per million people (2,753). It’s surpassed only by Ireland (5,156), the United Kingdom (4,595) and the U.S. (7,774), and fares well below Australia (307), New Zealand (244) and Japan (148). COVID-19 cases per million people in Canada and other countries. (Authors), Author provided This pattern is the same when it comes to the number of deaths per million. With 227 deaths per million, Canada fares better than the U.K. (382), Ireland (351) and the U.S. (382), yet it fares poorly compared to Japan (7.7), New Zealand (4.5) and Australia (4.1). Canada’s death rate, in fact, is 29 times higher than Japan’s, 50 times higher than New Zealand’s and 55 times higher than Australia’s. COVID-19 deaths per million people in Canada and other countries. (Authors), Author provided In the U.K., the high number of cases and deaths could be attributed to the government’s hesitancy to implement lockdown measures and, in the U.S., to how government officials, including President Donald Trump, have consistently downplayed the severity of the pandemic. Yet those reasons don’t apply to Canada, where stringent lockdown measures were implemented. In March, Canada closed its borders to all foreign nationals, and most provinces imposed strict physical distancing measures. Rise of neoliberalism at play? The findings could be interpreted as consequential of the rise of neoliberalism in the country. The last three decades have been characterized by government cutbacks, decreased public spending, deregulation and policies centred on limited state intervention. Read more: What exactly is neoliberalism? The 1996 Canada Health and Social Transfer amalgamated federal funding for health, education and social assistance, reducing it to the amount of what was initially allocated to social assistance only. By 2017, federal cuts to health-care funding had resulted in an estimated $31 billion shortfall. A man takes a walk outside the Seven Oaks Long-Term Care Home in Toronto in June 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn Such changes have been criticized for weakening the capacity of the federal government to ensure provinces conform to national principles of adequately providing health care to their citizens. Take the example of the provincial testing lab in Windsor, Ont., which tested for tuberculosis and the West Nile virus. It was built in 1966, in the golden era of the Canadian welfare state, to service Windsor-Essex in southwestern Ontario. Despite public outcry, the lab was demolished in 2010 to make way for a new highway. Test samples now have to be shipped to London or Hamilton for analysis. Health experts have pointed out the facility could have conducted testing for COVID-19, and somewhat redressed the low testing rates in the area. Only 2.5 per cent of the local population in Windsor-Essex had been tested by May 2020. Long-term care homes at the epicentre Another possible explanation for the higher mortality and infection rates in Canada rests in long-term residential facilities. About 82 per cent of Canada’s COVID-19 deaths have been in long-term care homes.

In Australia, a comparable liberal state, the deaths in long-term care homes represented only 25 per cent of the country’s COVID-19 mortality rates. Canada has a universal health-care system, yet health-care gaps are common. Long-term care, for instance, relies heavily on the private sector to deliver services. In 1996, the Conservative government removed regulations requiring a minimum of one registered nurse to be on duty at all times and the allocation of a minimum of 2.25 hours of daily nursing care per resident. Former Ontario Premier Mike Harris is seen at the funeral service for Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s mother Diane Ford in Toronto in January 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young In Ontario in the 1990s, the government of Mike Harris expanded the number of nursing home beds in the private sector. The staggering amounts of money spent on senior care have been channelled towards private shareholders. Now Harris is the chairman of Chartwell Corp., one of the province’s largest for-profit senior care providers and a company that has spent $845 million over the last 10 years on executive compensation and shareholder dividends. While further research on the relationship between COVID-19 numbers and welfare state systems is needed, it’s clear that Canada must do much more to tackle pandemics now and in the future.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Over the past few months, everyday housework, like cooking and washing dishes, has multiplied and most parents have become responsible for teaching their kids. Given the uneven distribution of these tasks before the pandemic, much of this extra work has fallen squarely on mothers. Our work looks at trends in housework and child care during the early stages of the pandemic in Canada as one way to measure how it might disproportionately harm women. Housework and child care are important markers of equity for a few reasons. Family responsibilities often default to mothers, negatively impacting their career and economic opportunities. Women’s physical and mental health is linked to how equally partners share family-related tasks. Romantic relationship quality and stability are also tied to perceptions of equity in housework and child care. Research finds that dads are stepping up to the challenges of housework and child care posed by the pandemic. (Picsea/Unsplash) Housework and child care We surveyed nearly 1,250 Canadian mothers and fathers about family and work arrangements before and during the pandemic. Because of the substantial gender gaps in housework and child care before COVID-19, we looked at the perception of how much domestic work Canadian fathers were doing immediately before the pandemic in May 2020, about a month and a half after public health orders took effect. When it came to preparing meals, cleaning and shopping for essentials, a small proportion of men were perceived as reducing their portion, most did about the same and a sizeable minority increased their share. Indeed, in the central tasks of preparing meals, doing dishes and housecleaning, about twice as many men increased their share as decreased it. Notably, shifts are uneven across tasks. For example, fathers took on less of the laundry — the task fathers did the least before the pandemic — than meal preparation or going to the grocery store. Although many men do the majority of tasks like lawn mowing or house repair, these are fundamentally different activities because they are done less frequently and are often non-essential. Perceived changes in housework since beginning of pandemic. (Shafer, Scheibling, & Milkie 2020) In considering child care, we looked at a gamut of parenting tasks: from enforcing rules to organizing daily routines and activities. The patterns around child care largely mirror those for housework. Interestingly, increases in paternal task sharing are highest for those tasks most commonly associated with fathering — like playing with children. At the same time, however, a number of fathers are increasingly engaged in physical caregiving (e.g., changing diapers, helping kids get dressed, etc.) and providing emotional support. In an era where kids’ routines have been suddenly upended and their mental health has appreciably declined, this may be an important shift in the paternal role. Perceived changes in child care since beginning of pandemic. (Shafer, Scheibling, & Milkie 2020) Of course, mothers’ work in the home increased, as well. But notably, we found that both mothers and fathers report a movement toward more equality in most tasks — although there are important gender differences in these perceptions. Gender differences in perceptions of fathers’ increased labour. (Shafer, Scheibling, & Milkie 2020) Stagnation or regression There is good reason to worry about the effects of COVID-19 on gender equality. Although the percentage of women in the paid labour force has doubled in the past 50 years, men’s participation in domestic labour has failed to keep pace. In 1986, Canadian fathers spent about 40 per cent of the time mothers put into housework and child care. Three decades later, those gaps have narrowed, but women still perform the majority of housework and child care. Persistent inequality in domestic labour has many sources — all of which could be amplified during the pandemic. Gender pay gaps, particularly among parents, often cause families to privilege the careers of fathers over mothers. Societal expectations and the lack of policy supports, like access to affordable child care, pressure many women to reduce their hours or quit working in order to care for young children. Work arrangements of heterosexual parents also play an important role in the maintenance of inequalities at home. For example, mothers do about 14 additional hours of housework each week in families where fathers are the only breadwinner, but the gap is only four hours in dual-earner families. Increased family need, combined with commonly held gender norms and work–family arrangements may cause many families to prioritize men’s work during this pandemic. Research from both Canada and the United Kingdom, for example, shows that a significant number of mothers voluntarily left the labour force in order to take on expanded child care, educational and household needs. Canadian moms, often earning less than their male partners, are forced to leave work during times of crisis. (Alexander Dummer/Unsplash) Fathers stepping up While couples may have been pushed toward greater inequality, there may be countervailing forces. COVID-19 public health orders led many men to work from home, which made many fathers more keenly aware of domestic and parental tasks suddenly thrown into their workdays. Research on flexible work arrangements has shown that fathers who choose to telecommute tend to be more involved parents than fathers with less flexible work arrangements. However, there may be significant differences between dads who voluntarily used flexible work opportunities pre-pandemic and those who were involuntarily forced into working from home. Increases in unemployment among fathers might have increased exposure to family needs, as well. Evidence from the Great Recession of 2007-09 suggests that many unemployed men shifted a considerable portion of the hours normally devoted in paid work into housework, child care and other domestic tasks. Fathers’ participation in housework and child care has remained stable or even slightly improved for the majority of Canadian families in the early stages of the pandemic. At the same time, a minority of families seem poised to regress toward greater inequality in housework and child care. Overall, early trends do not foretell that gender inequality at home will deepen. Although Canadian mothers are still doing a greater share of the work, many Canadian fathers are stepping up at home in times of crisis. Nevertheless, the rapidly changing scenarios around this pandemic will require scholars and policymakers to consider its effects on gender equality across the coming months and years.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger We need to change our transportation system, and we need to do it quickly. Road transportation is a major consumer of fossil fuels, contributing 16 per cent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, which warm up the Earth’s atmosphere and cause changes to the climate. It also pollutes the air, threatening health and costing taxpayers billions of dollars annually. At the same time, electric vehicles are getting cheaper, and vehicle range and the availability of charging stations are improving. This is exciting for many because it seems to suggest an easy and convenient answer to the problem of transportation emissions: if everyone swapped their fossil-fuelled vehicle for an electric equivalent, we could all keep driving, safe in the knowledge that we are no longer killing the planet by doing so — and all while enjoying a new car that is quiet, cheap to power and fun to drive. Everybody wins, right? Unfortunately, it’s unlikely to be that simple. The battery supply crunch Electric vehicles still produce air pollution and greenhouse gases from their brakes, tires, the electricity that powers them and the factories that build them. Even if we can address (or ignore) these problems, there is a much larger stumbling block facing personal electric vehicles as a solution for climate change. In 2019, the world produced about 160 gigawatt hours (GWh) of lithium-ion batteries. That’s enough for a little more than three million standard-range Tesla Model 3s — and only if we use those batteries for cars, and don’t build any smart-phones, laptops or grid storage facilities. The battery production capacity currently under construction will allow the production of the equivalent of 40 million electric vehicles annually by 2028, according to one estimate. Battery production could increase to cover 40 million electric vehicles annually by 2028, but there are over one billion vehicles on roads today. (Shutterstock) That sounds like a lot until you see that the world produced nearly 100 million cars, vans, buses and trucks in 2019 alone. There are around 1.4 billion motor vehicles in the world today — a number that will almost certainly continue to increase if we don’t take major steps to shift transportation onto other modes. Even at the projected 2028 level of battery production capacity, it would take us 35 years to replace this global vehicle fleet with electric models. That’s not nearly fast enough to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Maximizing climate impact The unavoidable conclusion is that we will not be able to electrify all of our transportation in the timeframe necessary to deal with climate change. Some journeys will have to be decarbonized through other means, such as cycling, walking, public transit or telecommuting. Electric scooters could help cities move towards zero-carbon mobility. (Shutterstock) Lithium-ion batteries should therefore go primarily to vehicles intended for long distances or large cargo loads. Garbage trucks, buses, pickup trucks used by skilled tradespeople to get to job sites and the van that delivers your Amazon purchases are all prime candidates for electrification. That Nissan Leaf you’ve been eyeing, unfortunately is not. You can probably travel on a bicycle or a city bus much more easily than a truckload of power tools, parcels or municipal waste can. A win-win scenario There are a lot of side benefits to focusing on commercial vehicles for electrification. Currently, these vehicles often burn diesel, which produces 100 times more particulate pollution than gasoline vehicles. Diesel vehicles were responsible for approximately 83 per cent of all deaths due to air pollution from road vehicles in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Diesel freight vehicles also tend to be noisy — a problem that is almost entirely eliminated by going electric. Replacing diesel-powered transport trucks with electric ones could cut noise, air pollution and carbon emissions. (Shutterstock) For us in Canada, perhaps the greatest benefit to a focus on electrifying the commercial vehicle fleet is that several companies here are already emerging as leaders in developing and building them. Lion Electric, in Saint-Jérôme, Que., makes electric buses, trucks and school buses. New Flyer, based in Winnipeg, has already sold electric transit buses to several major American cities. And Green Jobs Oshawa has already developed a plan to convert the Oshawa General Motors facility to the produce electric vehicles for the Canadian public sector. Our car sector is struggling, but a focus on building commercial electric vehicles could bring jobs back to this area in a big way. There’s no way around it: We need fewer cars As for the rest of us, the solution to zero-carbon mobility looks much more like a bike, a bus seat, a home office, a mobility scooter or a well-worn pair of shoes than a shiny new Tesla. Some of these solutions can still take advantage of electric mobility without straining the global battery budget. With just over five per cent of 2019’s lithium-ion battery production, for example, there would be enough batteries to provide an Urban Machina electric scooter to every Canadian. There is already talk of a federal government bail-out of the Canadian car industry, with stakeholders suggesting that this could be an opportunity to encourage the development of electric vehicle production in Canada. If the government wants to do this in a way that has the greatest impact on the climate, it should look beyond supporting fancy personal vehicles, and turn its attention instead to the unglamorous workhorses that make our society function.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As of July 18, it is mandatory to wear masks in indoor public spaces in Québec following similar edicts across the country. While inspired by growing evidence that masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19, this seems deeply ironic in a province so opposed to face coverings that Québec passed legislation that forbade people from receiving certain government services if their face was covered. Read more: Quebec's niqab ban uses women's bodies to bolster right-wing extremism The Toronto Transit Commission made face coverings mandatory at the beginning of July. And yet, just three years ago, TTC workers were forbidden from wearing masks to protect themselves against air pollution in the subway system. The TTC also instructed its workers not to wear masks during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Toronto. Clearly, our discomfort about wearing masks in the midst of a pandemic has deep roots. Bad smells and bird beaks Medical mask-wearing has a long history. In the past few months, pictures of the beaked masks that doctors wore during the 17th-century plague epidemic have been circulating online. At the time, disease was believed to spread through miasmas — bad smells that wafted through the air. The beak was stuffed with herbs, spices and dried flowers to ward off the odors believed to spread the plague. Mask worn by a doctor at the end of the 17th century when visiting those afflicted by the plague. (Wellcome Collection) In North America, before the 1918 influenza epidemic, surgeons wore masks, as did nurses and doctors who were treating contagious patients in a hospital setting. But during the flu epidemic, cities around the world passed mandatory masking orders. Historian Nancy Tomes argues that mask-wearing was embraced by the American public as “an emblem of public spiritedness and discipline.” Women accustomed to knitting socks and rolling bandages for soldiers quickly took to mask-making as a patriotic duty. That said, the enthusiasm for mask-wearing waned quickly, as Alfred W. Crosby showed in America’s Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918. Canadian reluctance and Japanese willingness In her study of the 1918 flu in Canada, historian Janice Dickin McGinnis argued that masks were “widely unpopular” and that even in places with mandatory masking orders in place, people often failed to wear them or just pulled them on when police appeared. Public health officers were dubious about the value of masks. In Alberta, for example, the flu first appeared at the beginning of October 1918. By the end of the month, the province ordered everyone to wear a mask outside of their homes, to be removed only in the case of eating. In just four weeks, the order was rescinded. The Medical Officer of Health for Edmonton reported that practically no one wore a mask thereafter, except in hospitals. In his view, the rapid spread of the disease after the mask order was put into effect made the order an object of “ridicule.” In Japan, by contrast, the public embraced mask-wearing during the Spanish flu. According to sociologist Mitsutoshi Horii, mask-wearing symbolized “modernity.” In the post-war era, Japanese people continued to wear masks to prevent the flu, only stopping in the 1970s when flu vaccines became widely available. In the 1980s and 1990s, mask-wearing increased to prevent allergies, as allergy to cedar pollen became a growing problem. In the late 1980s, the effectiveness of flu vaccinations declined and wearing a mask to avoid influenza resumed. Mask-wearing skyrocketed in the early years of the 21st century with the outbreak of SARS and avian influenza. The Japanese government recommended that all sick people wear masks to protect others, while they suggested that healthy people could wear them as a preventative measure. Horii argues that mask-wearing was a “neoliberal answer to the question of public health policy” in that it encouraged people to take individual responsibility for their own health. When H1N1 hit Japan in 2009, it first struck tourists who had returned from Canada. The sick were blamed for failing to wear masks while abroad. In a country that takes etiquette very seriously, wearing masks in Japan has become a form of politeness. In Japan, wearing a face mask is a widespread practice. (Draconiansleet/flickr), CC BY A century of Chinese mask-wearing Similarly, in China, mask-wearing has a long history. A pneumonic plague epidemic in China in 1910-11 sparked widespread mask-wearing there. After the Communists came to power in 1949, there was intense fear of germ warfare, leading many to wear masks. In the 21st century, the SARS epidemic intensified mask-wearing, as did the smog that blanketed many Chinese cities. The Chinese government urged its citizens to protect themselves against pollution by wearing masks. During the COVID-19 epidemic, some of the first people in Canada to wear masks were people with ties to Asia, who were already accustomed to the practice of masking. One of the first cases of COVID-19 in Canada was that of a student at Western University who had visited her parents in Wuhan over the Christmas break. On the flight back to Canada, she wore a mask. She self-isolated upon her arrival in Canada and when she became sick, she showed up at the hospital wearing a mask. She did not infect anyone else. Crafting masks Long before Etsy crafters and Old Navy began producing fashionable masks for the North American market, colourful masks were available in India, Taiwan, Thailand and other Asian countries. During the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, the New York Times reported that consumers could purchase masks with Hello Kitty and other cartoon characters, as well American flag masks meant to show the wearer’s support for democracy. Ironically, given that the masks are intended to protect others, mask-wearing has made Asians in Canada a target of racist attacks. In the early days of COVID-19, Western media outlets featured Asians wearing masks as a harbinger of the epidemic. Asians wearing masks have been verbally and physically attacked. Read more: Unmasking the racial politics of the coronavirus pandemic Contentious choices Controversies over masks continue. On July 15, a man died after a confrontation with the Ontario Provincial Police after he reportedly assaulted staff at a grocery store who insisted he wear a mask. Some Canadians complain that masks are uncomfortable, unnecessary, harmful to their own health or ineffective. Masks can be a visual representation of the threat of COVID-19 and make people feel more fearful; an “optimism bias” can make people reluctant to wear masks because they think that the novel coronavirus will not affect them. There are also real concerns that masks impede communication for frail elders and the hearing impaired. But support for mask-wearing appears to be growing. In the face of a serious health threat, Canadians are wisely following the lead of Asian countries. Japan China Canada Quebec COVID-19 surgical masks Face coverings mask-wearing Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As COVID-19 spread across the globe, governments looked to epidemiologists to slow its transmission. Without a vaccine, large-scale testing capacity and sufficient critical-care beds, epidemiologists pushed countries to enact social distancing measures and to lock down economies. These policies saved lives and bought time to better understand the virus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, however, significant social and economic costs have resulted from the prolonged lockdowns. Blanket policies were enacted that didn’t take into consideration the social and economic costs or the ability of businesses to adapt their operations to mitigate the risks. A shopper walks in the relatively empty Bayshore Shopping Centre mall in Ottawa on its first day open as part of Stage 2 of Ontario’s plan to lift COVID-19 lockdowns. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang While the uncertainty arising from this unprecedented situation makes additional caution understandable, it’s important to review the lessons learned before a second wave of COVID-19 or the next viral pandemic so we can better manage future crises in a way that limits medical, social and economic costs. Lessons learned Lesson 1: Simple behaviours are the most effective response. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced with simple actions, as noted by Bonnie Henry, now the medical officer of health for British Columbia, in her 2009 book Soap and Water & Common Sense: The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria, Parasites, and Disease. Hand washing, regular disinfecting of surfaces, wearing face masks and social distancing can drop the R0 below 1 and limit community spread of the virus. Lesson 2: Testing and tracking identify hot spots. Open access to COVID-19 testing allows communities to identify and limit the rate of transmission. It also allows an assessment of the impact of public health measures on transmission rates. Tracking technologies can identify outbreak hot spots or locations of high transmission. Once identified, these hot spots can be managed (and closed if required) while allowing others to remain open. In addition, data from tracking enables analytical modelling to understand current and projected transmission paths. Lesson 3: Consistency shapes norms. Regions that effectively managed virus transmission had consistent messaging from different levels of government, promoting the simple behaviours needed to reduce transmission. Messages that also provide a rationale for the necessary behavioural changes are most effective. Read more: Clear, consistent health messaging critical to stemming epidemics and limiting coronavirus deaths Lesson 4: Businesses adapt quickly. Businesses continually adapt and manage behaviours through simple and technological solutions. In response to COVID-19, retail stores reduced hours to increase time for sanitization, eliminated promotions to reduce in-store congestion and installed plexiglass shields at checkouts. Digital technologies have led to touchless options, reducing the potential for physical transmission in workplaces. When virus outbreaks have occurred, many businesses closed, adjusted and reopened. Lesson 5: Social costs must be considered. Since the start of the pandemic, domestic abuse cases increased significantly, and suicide rates are anticipated to rise by 20 to 30 per cent. Loss of health insurance from unemployment has increased health inequities in countries without public funded systems. Furthermore, the pandemic has resulted in increased non-coronavirus deaths from untreated or under-treated acute and chronic medical conditions because of fear and inability to access medical care. Models that only included COVID-related deaths have overestimated the number of lives saved and underestimated the costs to society. Lesson 6: No economy is immune. The prolonged lockdown of economies has led to an estimated loss of more than US$12 trillion dollars in global GDP, and approximately one-third of the global population has experienced unemployment. More than 95 per cent of countries are projected to have negative per capita income growth in 2020. Closing businesses has led to a global ripple effect. Countries that allowed businesses to operate during their outbreaks are still experiencing economic downturns resulting from the global recession. Two conclusions These lessons support two conclusions. First, virus transmission can be reduced through the simple steps of consistently reinforcing appropriate behaviours, and widespread testing for and tracking of the virus. Handwashing is among the simple measures that can help contain COVID-19. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson Second, governments need to prepare for other potential viruses by creating different transmission path scenarios, and identifying the best steps to limit spread for those paths while also managing economic and social consequences. Delays in enacting appropriate policies led to higher health costs, and pre-planning can reduce delays at the beginning of a pandemic. Governments must work together, prior to the next pandemic or COVID-19’s second wave, to develop policies that protect the inter-connectivity of the global economy. They need to co-ordinate with trading partners to protect essential goods and supply chain networks once a pandemic occurs. Lives can be saved while also stabilizing business; it’s not an either/or decision. Integrating both human and economic factors into predictive models can both minimize the spread of the virus and reduce the economic impact.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The ongoing, coronavirus-fuelled media crisis has in fact been in the works for more than 30 years. It is not a new phenomenon. In the early 1990s, we saw mergers of major radio networks. The advent of the internet and cable news outlets during the 1990s changed the game and challenged the dominance of news agencies, since audiences had access to live events in real time all the time. The emergence of social media in the 2000s and 2010s continues to transform the role of the media today. The media in crisis is a constant; it was simply amplified by COVID-19. But it’s still taken a toll. More than 135 Canadian media organizations have closed up shop since March 2020. In March and April, 2,000 positions were cut across the country, according to the Canadian Association of Journalists. In the United States, 36,000 journalism jobs have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic, the New York Times reported in April. Poynter has been keeping a running tally of this ever-growing number. The causes of the enduring media crisis worldwide are known: a dramatic drop in advertising revenue for media to the benefit of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, who now share the pie and pay little or no taxes in Canada. But there was also a reluctance to embrace technology by American news organizations, and those in Canada too. The digital shift happened too late in many cases. Many news organizations, especially newspapers, dragged their heels when it came to a digital transformation. (Roman Kraft Zua/Unsplash) News media underestimated the role of smartphones: 94 per cent of young readers consume news on their phones or through social media, according to the latest research from the Québec-based CEFRIO research center. News audiences are also more fragmented than ever before, with an increasing number of specialized news sources, whether it’s sports, finance, lifestyle, etc. This overabundance of information has caused some citizens to tune out, overwhelmed by the avalanche of news. Some successful models emerging Nonetheless there are some glimmers of hope. Groupe Capitales Médias filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in Québec, but its six newspapers, representing about half of the daily newspapers in the province, were revived as a non-profit co-operative in 2020. There are other business models working well in the country, like the one used by Montréal-based Le Devoir, based on paid subscriptions, advertising and donations. The small newspaper launched its paywall in the 1990s, specialized its content (politics, culture, social issues) and made a major digital shift. This resulted in a $1.6 million surplus in 2019. Are there other possible solutions for solving the crisis in Canada and elsewhere? Six potential solutions Here are some suggestions: The financial media assistance promised by Canada’s federal government ($600 million over five years) has still not arrived, two years after it was announced. That’s shameful. Provincial aid to media organizations — $250 million over five years — is already being distributed in Québec. Government funding remains essential to preserve democracy and fight news deserts. Content monetization: Local media have no other choice but to set up paywalls on their sites and sign piecemeal agreements with Apple News, Facebook and Google News for better revenue-sharing. News organizations also need to attract philanthropic donors and pursue crowd-funding to finance specific news projects that will benefit readers. Diversification of production is necessary. Content needs to be diversified with specialized newsletters, podcasts, videos, event and conference management and brand content that could replace traditional advertising. Value-added content: Media organizations should let news agencies like QMI and The Canadian Press deal with daily breaking news and focus now on long-form journalism, investigative reporting, features, interviews, newsletters, explanatory content, etc. This will force media organizations to value data-driven, investigative and solutions journalism. Now more than ever, citizens want to read content that’s thoughtful, important or hopeful. Tackling fake news and distrust in the media is paramount. There needs to be an active push against the prevailing public cynicism by employing more fact-checking, possibly with the help of artificial intelligence. Media organizations also need to reconnect with their audiences, young people in particular, by covering a wider range of topics. In classrooms, we must set up civic media education seminars to demystify the work of journalists and the media. There is a severe lack of diversity in newsrooms across Canada, especially Québec. There are not enough journalists from racialized groups and Indigenous communities. There will need to be a profound change on this issue all across Canada so that news organizations reflect the country’s population and report on the issues that matter to diverse audiences. Read more: Newsrooms not keeping up with changing demographics, study suggests Reinvention needed There’s no question media organizations must reinvent themselves, and have needed to both before COVID-19 and today. But the situation is not desperate. Traffic on news sites has been up sharply since the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s not well-monetized. News organizations must go where readers are: on their phones. News sites have to be more user-friendly in terms of design — the recent success of the myFT app from the Financial Times in this regard is a great example of what works. News organizations need to go where their readers are — on their phones. (Yura Fresh/Unsplash) Whether there will be media mergers or other closures this year, or in 2021, remains to be seen. But in the meantime, we can make better use of technology by using automation for certain content (sports and financial news; translations) in order to free up newsroom reporters to focus on value-added journalism. Hopefully alliances and collaborations can also be formed among local media outlets across the country and national news organizations that could entail sharing content or other technology-based partnerships. A current example is the Local Journalism Initiative in Canada, operating via The Canadian Press to support local and civic journalism for under-served communities. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain in working hand and hand, together, to reimagine journalism in Canada. COVID-19 has simply reminded us to make it a top priority.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger We need to change our transportation system, and we need to do it quickly. Road transportation is a major consumer of fossil fuels, contributing 16 per cent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, which warm up the Earth’s atmosphere and cause changes to the climate. It also pollutes the air, threatening health and costing taxpayers billions of dollars annually. At the same time, electric vehicles are getting cheaper, and vehicle range and the availability of charging stations are improving. This is exciting for many because it seems to suggest an easy and convenient answer to the problem of transportation emissions: if everyone swapped their fossil-fuelled vehicle for an electric equivalent, we could all keep driving, safe in the knowledge that we are no longer killing the planet by doing so — and all while enjoying a new car that is quiet, cheap to power and fun to drive. Everybody wins, right? Unfortunately, it’s unlikely to be that simple. The battery supply crunch Electric vehicles still produce air pollution and greenhouse gases from their brakes, tires, the electricity that powers them and the factories that build them. Even if we can address (or ignore) these problems, there is a much larger stumbling block facing personal electric vehicles as a solution for climate change. In 2019, the world produced about 160 gigawatt hours (GWh) of lithium-ion batteries. That’s enough for a little more than three million standard-range Tesla Model 3s — and only if we use those batteries for cars, and don’t build any smart-phones, laptops or grid storage facilities. The battery production capacity currently under construction will allow the production of the equivalent of 40 million electric vehicles annually by 2028, according to one estimate. Battery production could increase to cover 40 million electric vehicles annually by 2028, but there are over one billion vehicles on roads today. (Shutterstock) That sounds like a lot until you see that the world produced nearly 100 million cars, vans, buses and trucks in 2019 alone. There are around 1.4 billion motor vehicles in the world today — a number that will almost certainly continue to increase if we don’t take major steps to shift transportation onto other modes. Even at the projected 2028 level of battery production capacity, it would take us 35 years to replace this global vehicle fleet with electric models. That’s not nearly fast enough to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Maximizing climate impact The unavoidable conclusion is that we will not be able to electrify all of our transportation in the timeframe necessary to deal with climate change. Some journeys will have to be decarbonized through other means, such as cycling, walking, public transit or telecommuting. Electric scooters could help cities move towards zero-carbon mobility. (Shutterstock) Lithium-ion batteries should therefore go primarily to vehicles intended for long distances or large cargo loads. Garbage trucks, buses, pickup trucks used by skilled tradespeople to get to job sites and the van that delivers your Amazon purchases are all prime candidates for electrification. That Nissan Leaf you’ve been eyeing, unfortunately is not. You can probably travel on a bicycle or a city bus much more easily than a truckload of power tools, parcels or municipal waste can. A win-win scenario There are a lot of side benefits to focusing on commercial vehicles for electrification. Currently, these vehicles often burn diesel, which produces 100 times more particulate pollution than gasoline vehicles. Diesel vehicles were responsible for approximately 83 per cent of all deaths due to air pollution from road vehicles in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Diesel freight vehicles also tend to be noisy — a problem that is almost entirely eliminated by going electric. Replacing diesel-powered transport trucks with electric ones could cut noise, air pollution and carbon emissions. (Shutterstock) For us in Canada, perhaps the greatest benefit to a focus on electrifying the commercial vehicle fleet is that several companies here are already emerging as leaders in developing and building them. Lion Electric, in Saint-Jérôme, Que., makes electric buses, trucks and school buses. New Flyer, based in Winnipeg, has already sold electric transit buses to several major American cities. And Green Jobs Oshawa has already developed a plan to convert the Oshawa General Motors facility to the produce electric vehicles for the Canadian public sector. Our car sector is struggling, but a focus on building commercial electric vehicles could bring jobs back to this area in a big way. There’s no way around it: We need fewer cars As for the rest of us, the solution to zero-carbon mobility looks much more like a bike, a bus seat, a home office, a mobility scooter or a well-worn pair of shoes than a shiny new Tesla. Some of these solutions can still take advantage of electric mobility without straining the global battery budget. With just over five per cent of 2019’s lithium-ion battery production, for example, there would be enough batteries to provide an Urban Machina electric scooter to every Canadian. There is already talk of a federal government bail-out of the Canadian car industry, with stakeholders suggesting that this could be an opportunity to encourage the development of electric vehicle production in Canada. If the government wants to do this in a way that has the greatest impact on the climate, it should look beyond supporting fancy personal vehicles, and turn its attention instead to the unglamorous workhorses that make our society function.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Canadian response to the COVID-19 pandemic is widely seen as standing in sharp contrast to the situation in the United States. We would be remiss, however, to overlook the resemblance between the recent protest in Montréal against mandatory mask usage and anti-mask protests taking place across the United States. The similarities may indicate that the ideological chasm that has defined the American COVID-19 experience is making its way north of the border. The use of masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19 has divided Americans along partisan lines since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first issued its recommendation to wear cloth masks on April 3. President Donald Trump immediately rebuffed any suggestion he should wear one and set the stage for masks as a subject of political polarization. Demonstrators hold signs as they protest the lockdown and wearing masks in June 2020 in Huntington Beach, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) In Canada, the choice to wear a mask ostensibly does not carry the same political connotations that it does in the U.S. Recent findings from my organization, Vox Pop Labs, and our COVID-19 Monitor, indicate that 83 per cent of Canadians currently wear masks as part of their normal routine, compared to 67 per cent of Americans. The COVID-19 Monitor is one of the largest ongoing studies of public opinion on the coronavirus in Canada. Canadians trust public health officials In Canada, measures to contain COVID-19 have generally been less contested by politicians, and trust in the guidance offered by public health officials has remained consistently high. A study I co-authored as Canadian provinces began declaring states of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic found that most Canadians, regardless of their politics, exhibited similar levels of compliance with emergency orders. The study also found, however, that perceptions both of the threat of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the government response were tinged by partisanship. In the months since that study was published, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in the rate of mask usage among Canadians, but we’ve also observed signs of partisan splintering. Data from the COVID-19 Monitor show that early adopters of masks spanned the partisan gamut — the only notable exception being Bloc Québecois supporters, who lagged behind other Canadians in their uptake of masks but now sit on par with Liberal, NDP and Green voters. The trend among Bloc Québecois voters speaks to their nationalist inclinations more than it does to conventional left-right ideology. The Québec government was initially quite reticent to accept revised guidance on masks from federal public health officials. But it ultimately endorsed the recommendation on masks after several weeks, and later became the first province to make them mandatory. The pattern among Bloc Québecois voters reflects their deference to the Québec government and how they follow its guidance quite closely. Mask usage among Canadians by partisanship. (COVID-19 Monitor/Vox Pop Labs) The more interesting standout in this analysis has to do with conservatives. During the first several months of the pandemic, supporters of the Conservative Party of Canada were relatively indistinguishable from other Canadians in terms of their mask usage, suggesting a cross-partisan consensus on masks early on in the pandemic. Clear divide emerges But by early June we observe a clear divide between Conservative voters and other Canadians in relation to mask usage — a divide that appears to be widening over time. We see the divide in mask-wearing habits even more clearly when we segment Canadians by ideology. Again, at the outset of the pandemic in mid-March, there was no correlation between mask usage and ideology. As the pandemic draws on, however, we see clear differences between left- and right-wing Canadians in terms of mask usage, with 94 per cent of left-wing Canadians reporting that they have adopted masks as part of their normal routine compared with only 68 per cent of Canadians who identify as right wing. Mask usage among Canadians by ideology. (COVID-19 Monitor/Vox Pop Labs) It’s important to note that the vast majority of right-wing Canadians are still wearing masks, but what’s concerning is that the divide between the two groups has increased over time. It’s also important to note that these findings do not necessarily indicate that partisanship or ideology are the primary determinants of mask adoption among Canadians. For example, Canadians tend to draw on different information sources depending on their political views. Previous research from the COVID-19 Monitor has demonstrated that Conservative supporters are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories about COVID-19, which may reflect a reliance on different news media. It seems unlikely that the varied uptake of masks between Canadians on either end of the ideological spectrum is an exclusive reaction to partisan cues given the relative solidarity among Canada’s political leaders. Even Trump wears a mask sometimes Even if right-wing Canadians are taking their lead from their counterparts south of the border, they are not necessarily parroting the behaviour of Trump. The U.S. president has recently done an ostensible about-face on masks, donning one himself in late July and endorsing them as “patriotic.” Trump wears a mask as he tours the Whirlpool Corp. facility in Clyde, Ohio, on Aug. 6, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Perhaps it’s too early to tell if this will have a mitigating effect on the partisan splits in mask-wearing habits among Americans, or if right-leaning Canadians will follow suit. But for the time being, there is no indication that the difference in mask usage among Conservatives relative to other Canadians is dissipating — if anything, it continues to increase.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 has placed a spotlight on the inequities of Canada’s current “curative” health-care system and the problems associated with viewing health policy in isolation from social factors. Post-COVID, we should not “go back to normal.” Instead, we should push for a health-care system that values prevention and acknowledges that all policy is health policy. We need to ensure that we address all factors that can produce and maintain health, not just help people once they’re sick. To best address population health, there needs to be a balance between preventive and curative measures, equitable access to social services, policies that emphasize the social determinants of health and a move away from the “sickness care system.” What was normal? Curative health care The curative approach to health care focuses on curing and treating the individual once they have been diagnosed with an ailment. The Canada Health Act defines “health” narrowly, and only ensures that “medically necessary” services are provided. Aside from being reactive, there is no firm definition of what constitutes a medically necessary service, and what is deemed medically necessary can change depending on the context in which it is provided. Services deemed not medically necessary include prescription medications, optometry, dental care and physiotherapy, among others. Even further removed from the medically necessary definition are social determinants of health, including safe housing, income security and an adequate social safety net. A preventive health system is focused on policies that help prevent illness, including addressing the social determinants of health. A curative health-care system is designed to treat people who are already sick. (Shutterstock) With the curative approach it’s impossible to have a population that is well, since that was never the goal of the system. There is also an argument that the curative approach to health care does more harm than good, as evidenced by medical errors, negative pharmaceutical interactions and the medicalization of everyday life experiences. The curative approach focuses on disease in the individual, rather than looking at social aspects and proximate factors that may impact the disease. Now, with COVID-19, there is no cure for the disease and so the curative approach already falls short. Where normal failed The advice given to the Canadian public as the best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home whenever possible, and wash their hands frequently. Although this may sound like good advice, it cannot be practised by all Canadians equally. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the impact of housing status on health. (Pixabay) Canadians are told to stay home as much as possible. But what if they don’t have a home? Do they take a chance on a homeless shelter, where overcrowding is inevitable? Although on the surface, this may seem like a housing policy issue, a labour policy issue or an economic policy issue, it is truly a public health policy issue. The privilege of owning a home is highlighted by the federal government, which allowed for mortgage payments to be deferred for eligible homeowners while no similar policy was put in place to defer rent payments. Instead, that decision is left to the individual landlords, and negatively impacts those with a lower socioeconomic status. Further, access to clean water is not available to all Canadians, as 61 Indigenous communities across the country are under boil-water advisories. Evidently, access to social determinants of health are not equally distributed. At the federal level, short-term financial measures have been put in place to help Canadians stay afloat, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). With more than three million Canadians out of work, COVID-19 has highlighted how precariously many Canadians were living. While these economic efforts may be useful right now, they’re merely Band-Aid solutions that are unlikely to have any lasting impact on the social determinants of health. Like the curative health system, they are reactive, not proactive; curative, not preventive. That means many of the factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19 cannot be effectively managed because there’s no adequate social safety net in place. Creating a ‘new normal’ When health and economic systems are in disarray, there’s no better time to reconstruct from the bottom up. There is no doubt that a preventive approach to health care would not only lead to a healthier population and more equitable access to social services, it would also be less expensive than our current system in the long term. As the largest chunk of GDP is spent on health care, shifting money to other policy areas that influence the social determinants of health will require major restructuring. Because we have a federal health system, change often occurs slowly and large-scale reform rarely occurs at all. This is demonstrated by Canada’s lack of a national pharmacare program, mental health strategy and national home-care program, despite them all having been discussed for the last several decades. Social determinants of health include things like gender, race, education, childhood experiences, physical environment, employment, income, healthy habits, access to medical care and social supports. (Pixabay, Canva) In response to COVID-19, every Canadian province declared a state of emergency, and so it wasn’t deemed necessary by the federal government to invoke the Emergencies Act. However, invoking the act may have been an opportune time to expand the definition of medically necessary services and pass sweeping health reform measures, such as national health programs, without pushback from the provinces. Health policy should be all-encompassing and consider the bidirectional relationship between upstream (preventive) and downstream (curative) measures, and it should be analyzed in the context of social determinants of health, including gender, race, education and socioeconomic factors. Canada should seize the opportunity for collaboration between the provinces and among government, private sector and community groups. Now is the time for integrative policies over reactive measures; public programs over privatization; and embracing preventive measures to avert illness. Now is the time for change. We should never go back to “normal.” Health care Medical care Social determinants of health Coronavirus Health care system COVID-19 Want to write?

While some research has suggested that remote work can be isolating, it also makes the competing priorities that workers are juggling very visible — even sometimes literally so due to the popularity of video calls. This has the potential to unite workers with the feeling that they are in this struggle of balancing work and personal responsibilities together. Whether it’s kids or pets that are popping up onscreen during Zoom calls, remote work has caused a relaxation in the traditional rules of professional presentation and resulted in a virtual workplace that is not only more flexible, but also more humane. Whether it’s kids or pets showing up on Zoom calls, remote work has caused more relaxed workplace attitudes. (Piqsels) My preliminary research on how remote work has impacted professionals at accounting firms across Canada suggests that working from home has important implications for how accountants, or any professional working from home for that matter, communicate their expertise and credibility in a virtual workplace. My survey of these workers suggests that what it means to behave “professionally” has changed, and that the pandemic has made clear the necessity of being able to bring one’s authentic self to work.

That’s almost twice the level reported before the lockdown began. The survey also found that just over one-quarter of employers said they’re likely to offer more employees the chance to continue remote work once the COVID-19 pandemic has passed, with almost 15 per cent saying they plan to make it mandatory. The accounting firm workers I interviewed suggested that almost all of their companies will allow employees at all seniority levels to work from home, at least part-time, going forward. Remote work is here to stay, and will likely have a lasting impact on how work is conducted. Making the personal visible Working from home provides a bird’s eye view into the personal lives of our colleagues, clients and even our bosses. With every Zoom call, we find ourselves being allowed into the private spaces of our co-workers in unprecedented ways. Zoom meetings have made the personal lives of our colleagues visible. Take for instance a British professor’s now-famous on-air intrusion, when her daughter interrupted her while she was being interviewed by the BBC. But Clare Wenham, a working mother at home with her child, is not the exception but rather the rule during the COVID-19 pandemic. BBC News. My research suggests that rather than detracting from how one is perceived professionally, these glimpses into co-workers’ personal lives can improve workplace interactions. Seeing a colleague’s cat or meeting their child on-screen provides a sense of community that people used to get at work and are now desperately craving. These on-camera interactions allow workers to reconnect or get to know one another in a new way. Seeing a co-worker’s children on a Zoom call helps work colleagues get to know each other better. (Rohit Farmer/Unsplash) They also enable employees to see their colleagues as human beings with competing priorities, and they consequently become more flexible and understanding as work and personal lives overlap. This may mean being more tolerant of a missed deadline or more understanding of an unconventional work schedule. Workwear increasingly casual There’s lots of tips available on how to dress when working from home, but my research suggests that since the beginning of the lockdown, workwear has become increasingly casual. While a minimal level of formality is maintained during video calls with clients, respondents are increasingly casual with their colleagues. Some respondents even report hosting virtual “Pyjama Mondays” as a fun team-building activity. The decision to dress more casually is not only a desire for comfort, but also reflects both how employees feel about themselves and how they want others to perceive them. In the book You Are What You Wear: What Your Clothes Reveal About You, clinical psychologist Jennifer Baumgartner explains that clothes often reflect how you feel about yourself. For harried employees who are juggling multiple personal and professional commitments, being seen in a hoodie and yoga pants illustrates the challenges they’re facing during the pandemic. Does how we dress reflect how we’re feeling about ourselves? (Daria Nepriakhina/Unsplash) But this can be a double-edged sword. Activities like Pyjama Days could undermine perceptions of expertise, maturity and competence. According to one study on dressing for success: “After just a three-second exposure to pictures of one man in a bespoke suit and one in a suit that is off-the-rack, people judged the man in the bespoke suit more favourably. Experiment participants also rated him as more confident, successful, flexible and a higher earner.” Focus on competence, not presentation But my respondents suggest that remote work removes the focus from what people are wearing to what they say and what they can do. Remote work provides the opportunity to level the playing field and emphasize talent and expertise over how employees present themselves. Altogether, my study reveals the potential positive benefits of working from home during a global pandemic. But will this represent a permanent shift in work attitudes? While my respondents tell me that their firms are implementing permanent plans to allow all employees to work remotely, I certainly hope that the positive changes I’m observing in the workplace continue whether people are at home or in the office.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As COVID-19 spread across the globe, governments looked to epidemiologists to slow its transmission. Without a vaccine, large-scale testing capacity and sufficient critical-care beds, epidemiologists pushed countries to enact social distancing measures and to lock down economies. These policies saved lives and bought time to better understand the virus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, however, significant social and economic costs have resulted from the prolonged lockdowns. Blanket policies were enacted that didn’t take into consideration the social and economic costs or the ability of businesses to adapt their operations to mitigate the risks. A shopper walks in the relatively empty Bayshore Shopping Centre mall in Ottawa on its first day open as part of Stage 2 of Ontario’s plan to lift COVID-19 lockdowns. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang While the uncertainty arising from this unprecedented situation makes additional caution understandable, it’s important to review the lessons learned before a second wave of COVID-19 or the next viral pandemic so we can better manage future crises in a way that limits medical, social and economic costs. Lessons learned Lesson 1: Simple behaviours are the most effective response. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced with simple actions, as noted by Bonnie Henry, now the medical officer of health for British Columbia, in her 2009 book Soap and Water & Common Sense: The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria, Parasites, and Disease. Hand washing, regular disinfecting of surfaces, wearing face masks and social distancing can drop the R0 below 1 and limit community spread of the virus. Lesson 2: Testing and tracking identify hot spots. Open access to COVID-19 testing allows communities to identify and limit the rate of transmission. It also allows an assessment of the impact of public health measures on transmission rates. Tracking technologies can identify outbreak hot spots or locations of high transmission. Once identified, these hot spots can be managed (and closed if required) while allowing others to remain open. In addition, data from tracking enables analytical modelling to understand current and projected transmission paths. Lesson 3: Consistency shapes norms. Regions that effectively managed virus transmission had consistent messaging from different levels of government, promoting the simple behaviours needed to reduce transmission. Messages that also provide a rationale for the necessary behavioural changes are most effective. Read more: Clear, consistent health messaging critical to stemming epidemics and limiting coronavirus deaths Lesson 4: Businesses adapt quickly. Businesses continually adapt and manage behaviours through simple and technological solutions. In response to COVID-19, retail stores reduced hours to increase time for sanitization, eliminated promotions to reduce in-store congestion and installed plexiglass shields at checkouts. Digital technologies have led to touchless options, reducing the potential for physical transmission in workplaces. When virus outbreaks have occurred, many businesses closed, adjusted and reopened. Lesson 5: Social costs must be considered. Since the start of the pandemic, domestic abuse cases increased significantly, and suicide rates are anticipated to rise by 20 to 30 per cent. Loss of health insurance from unemployment has increased health inequities in countries without public funded systems. Furthermore, the pandemic has resulted in increased non-coronavirus deaths from untreated or under-treated acute and chronic medical conditions because of fear and inability to access medical care. Models that only included COVID-related deaths have overestimated the number of lives saved and underestimated the costs to society. Lesson 6: No economy is immune. The prolonged lockdown of economies has led to an estimated loss of more than US$12 trillion dollars in global GDP, and approximately one-third of the global population has experienced unemployment. More than 95 per cent of countries are projected to have negative per capita income growth in 2020. Closing businesses has led to a global ripple effect. Countries that allowed businesses to operate during their outbreaks are still experiencing economic downturns resulting from the global recession. Two conclusions These lessons support two conclusions. First, virus transmission can be reduced through the simple steps of consistently reinforcing appropriate behaviours, and widespread testing for and tracking of the virus. Handwashing is among the simple measures that can help contain COVID-19. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson Second, governments need to prepare for other potential viruses by creating different transmission path scenarios, and identifying the best steps to limit spread for those paths while also managing economic and social consequences. Delays in enacting appropriate policies led to higher health costs, and pre-planning can reduce delays at the beginning of a pandemic. Governments must work together, prior to the next pandemic or COVID-19’s second wave, to develop policies that protect the inter-connectivity of the global economy. They need to co-ordinate with trading partners to protect essential goods and supply chain networks once a pandemic occurs. Lives can be saved while also stabilizing business; it’s not an either/or decision. Integrating both human and economic factors into predictive models can both minimize the spread of the virus and reduce the economic impact.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The ongoing, coronavirus-fuelled media crisis has in fact been in the works for more than 30 years. It is not a new phenomenon. In the early 1990s, we saw mergers of major radio networks. The advent of the internet and cable news outlets during the 1990s changed the game and challenged the dominance of news agencies, since audiences had access to live events in real time all the time. The emergence of social media in the 2000s and 2010s continues to transform the role of the media today. The media in crisis is a constant; it was simply amplified by COVID-19. But it’s still taken a toll. More than 135 Canadian media organizations have closed up shop since March 2020. In March and April, 2,000 positions were cut across the country, according to the Canadian Association of Journalists. In the United States, 36,000 journalism jobs have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic, the New York Times reported in April. Poynter has been keeping a running tally of this ever-growing number. The causes of the enduring media crisis worldwide are known: a dramatic drop in advertising revenue for media to the benefit of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, who now share the pie and pay little or no taxes in Canada. But there was also a reluctance to embrace technology by American news organizations, and those in Canada too. The digital shift happened too late in many cases. Many news organizations, especially newspapers, dragged their heels when it came to a digital transformation. (Roman Kraft Zua/Unsplash) News media underestimated the role of smartphones: 94 per cent of young readers consume news on their phones or through social media, according to the latest research from the Québec-based CEFRIO research center. News audiences are also more fragmented than ever before, with an increasing number of specialized news sources, whether it’s sports, finance, lifestyle, etc. This overabundance of information has caused some citizens to tune out, overwhelmed by the avalanche of news. Some successful models emerging Nonetheless there are some glimmers of hope. Groupe Capitales Médias filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in Québec, but its six newspapers, representing about half of the daily newspapers in the province, were revived as a non-profit co-operative in 2020. There are other business models working well in the country, like the one used by Montréal-based Le Devoir, based on paid subscriptions, advertising and donations. The small newspaper launched its paywall in the 1990s, specialized its content (politics, culture, social issues) and made a major digital shift. This resulted in a $1.6 million surplus in 2019. Are there other possible solutions for solving the crisis in Canada and elsewhere? Six potential solutions Here are some suggestions: The financial media assistance promised by Canada’s federal government ($600 million over five years) has still not arrived, two years after it was announced. That’s shameful. Provincial aid to media organizations — $250 million over five years — is already being distributed in Québec. Government funding remains essential to preserve democracy and fight news deserts. Content monetization: Local media have no other choice but to set up paywalls on their sites and sign piecemeal agreements with Apple News, Facebook and Google News for better revenue-sharing. News organizations also need to attract philanthropic donors and pursue crowd-funding to finance specific news projects that will benefit readers. Diversification of production is necessary. Content needs to be diversified with specialized newsletters, podcasts, videos, event and conference management and brand content that could replace traditional advertising. Value-added content: Media organizations should let news agencies like QMI and The Canadian Press deal with daily breaking news and focus now on long-form journalism, investigative reporting, features, interviews, newsletters, explanatory content, etc. This will force media organizations to value data-driven, investigative and solutions journalism. Now more than ever, citizens want to read content that’s thoughtful, important or hopeful. Tackling fake news and distrust in the media is paramount. There needs to be an active push against the prevailing public cynicism by employing more fact-checking, possibly with the help of artificial intelligence. Media organizations also need to reconnect with their audiences, young people in particular, by covering a wider range of topics. In classrooms, we must set up civic media education seminars to demystify the work of journalists and the media. There is a severe lack of diversity in newsrooms across Canada, especially Québec. There are not enough journalists from racialized groups and Indigenous communities. There will need to be a profound change on this issue all across Canada so that news organizations reflect the country’s population and report on the issues that matter to diverse audiences. Read more: Newsrooms not keeping up with changing demographics, study suggests Reinvention needed There’s no question media organizations must reinvent themselves, and have needed to both before COVID-19 and today. But the situation is not desperate. Traffic on news sites has been up sharply since the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s not well-monetized. News organizations must go where readers are: on their phones. News sites have to be more user-friendly in terms of design — the recent success of the myFT app from the Financial Times in this regard is a great example of what works. News organizations need to go where their readers are — on their phones. (Yura Fresh/Unsplash) Whether there will be media mergers or other closures this year, or in 2021, remains to be seen. But in the meantime, we can make better use of technology by using automation for certain content (sports and financial news; translations) in order to free up newsroom reporters to focus on value-added journalism. Hopefully alliances and collaborations can also be formed among local media outlets across the country and national news organizations that could entail sharing content or other technology-based partnerships. A current example is the Local Journalism Initiative in Canada, operating via The Canadian Press to support local and civic journalism for under-served communities. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain in working hand and hand, together, to reimagine journalism in Canada. COVID-19 has simply reminded us to make it a top priority.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Canadian response to the COVID-19 pandemic is widely seen as standing in sharp contrast to the situation in the United States. We would be remiss, however, to overlook the resemblance between the recent protest in Montréal against mandatory mask usage and anti-mask protests taking place across the United States. The similarities may indicate that the ideological chasm that has defined the American COVID-19 experience is making its way north of the border. The use of masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19 has divided Americans along partisan lines since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first issued its recommendation to wear cloth masks on April 3. President Donald Trump immediately rebuffed any suggestion he should wear one and set the stage for masks as a subject of political polarization. Demonstrators hold signs as they protest the lockdown and wearing masks in June 2020 in Huntington Beach, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) In Canada, the choice to wear a mask ostensibly does not carry the same political connotations that it does in the U.S. Recent findings from my organization, Vox Pop Labs, and our COVID-19 Monitor, indicate that 83 per cent of Canadians currently wear masks as part of their normal routine, compared to 67 per cent of Americans. The COVID-19 Monitor is one of the largest ongoing studies of public opinion on the coronavirus in Canada. Canadians trust public health officials In Canada, measures to contain COVID-19 have generally been less contested by politicians, and trust in the guidance offered by public health officials has remained consistently high. A study I co-authored as Canadian provinces began declaring states of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic found that most Canadians, regardless of their politics, exhibited similar levels of compliance with emergency orders. The study also found, however, that perceptions both of the threat of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the government response were tinged by partisanship. In the months since that study was published, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in the rate of mask usage among Canadians, but we’ve also observed signs of partisan splintering. Data from the COVID-19 Monitor show that early adopters of masks spanned the partisan gamut — the only notable exception being Bloc Québecois supporters, who lagged behind other Canadians in their uptake of masks but now sit on par with Liberal, NDP and Green voters. The trend among Bloc Québecois voters speaks to their nationalist inclinations more than it does to conventional left-right ideology. The Québec government was initially quite reticent to accept revised guidance on masks from federal public health officials. But it ultimately endorsed the recommendation on masks after several weeks, and later became the first province to make them mandatory. The pattern among Bloc Québecois voters reflects their deference to the Québec government and how they follow its guidance quite closely. Mask usage among Canadians by partisanship. (COVID-19 Monitor/Vox Pop Labs) The more interesting standout in this analysis has to do with conservatives. During the first several months of the pandemic, supporters of the Conservative Party of Canada were relatively indistinguishable from other Canadians in terms of their mask usage, suggesting a cross-partisan consensus on masks early on in the pandemic. Clear divide emerges But by early June we observe a clear divide between Conservative voters and other Canadians in relation to mask usage — a divide that appears to be widening over time. We see the divide in mask-wearing habits even more clearly when we segment Canadians by ideology. Again, at the outset of the pandemic in mid-March, there was no correlation between mask usage and ideology. As the pandemic draws on, however, we see clear differences between left- and right-wing Canadians in terms of mask usage, with 94 per cent of left-wing Canadians reporting that they have adopted masks as part of their normal routine compared with only 68 per cent of Canadians who identify as right wing. Mask usage among Canadians by ideology. (COVID-19 Monitor/Vox Pop Labs) It’s important to note that the vast majority of right-wing Canadians are still wearing masks, but what’s concerning is that the divide between the two groups has increased over time. It’s also important to note that these findings do not necessarily indicate that partisanship or ideology are the primary determinants of mask adoption among Canadians. For example, Canadians tend to draw on different information sources depending on their political views. Previous research from the COVID-19 Monitor has demonstrated that Conservative supporters are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories about COVID-19, which may reflect a reliance on different news media. It seems unlikely that the varied uptake of masks between Canadians on either end of the ideological spectrum is an exclusive reaction to partisan cues given the relative solidarity among Canada’s political leaders. Even Trump wears a mask sometimes Even if right-wing Canadians are taking their lead from their counterparts south of the border, they are not necessarily parroting the behaviour of Trump. The U.S. president has recently done an ostensible about-face on masks, donning one himself in late July and endorsing them as “patriotic.” Trump wears a mask as he tours the Whirlpool Corp. facility in Clyde, Ohio, on Aug. 6, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Perhaps it’s too early to tell if this will have a mitigating effect on the partisan splits in mask-wearing habits among Americans, or if right-leaning Canadians will follow suit. But for the time being, there is no indication that the difference in mask usage among Conservatives relative to other Canadians is dissipating — if anything, it continues to increase.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 has placed a spotlight on the inequities of Canada’s current “curative” health-care system and the problems associated with viewing health policy in isolation from social factors. Post-COVID, we should not “go back to normal.” Instead, we should push for a health-care system that values prevention and acknowledges that all policy is health policy. We need to ensure that we address all factors that can produce and maintain health, not just help people once they’re sick. To best address population health, there needs to be a balance between preventive and curative measures, equitable access to social services, policies that emphasize the social determinants of health and a move away from the “sickness care system.” What was normal? Curative health care The curative approach to health care focuses on curing and treating the individual once they have been diagnosed with an ailment. The Canada Health Act defines “health” narrowly, and only ensures that “medically necessary” services are provided. Aside from being reactive, there is no firm definition of what constitutes a medically necessary service, and what is deemed medically necessary can change depending on the context in which it is provided. Services deemed not medically necessary include prescription medications, optometry, dental care and physiotherapy, among others. Even further removed from the medically necessary definition are social determinants of health, including safe housing, income security and an adequate social safety net. A preventive health system is focused on policies that help prevent illness, including addressing the social determinants of health. A curative health-care system is designed to treat people who are already sick. (Shutterstock) With the curative approach it’s impossible to have a population that is well, since that was never the goal of the system. There is also an argument that the curative approach to health care does more harm than good, as evidenced by medical errors, negative pharmaceutical interactions and the medicalization of everyday life experiences. The curative approach focuses on disease in the individual, rather than looking at social aspects and proximate factors that may impact the disease. Now, with COVID-19, there is no cure for the disease and so the curative approach already falls short. Where normal failed The advice given to the Canadian public as the best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is to stay home whenever possible, and wash their hands frequently. Although this may sound like good advice, it cannot be practised by all Canadians equally. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the impact of housing status on health. (Pixabay) Canadians are told to stay home as much as possible. But what if they don’t have a home? Do they take a chance on a homeless shelter, where overcrowding is inevitable? Although on the surface, this may seem like a housing policy issue, a labour policy issue or an economic policy issue, it is truly a public health policy issue. The privilege of owning a home is highlighted by the federal government, which allowed for mortgage payments to be deferred for eligible homeowners while no similar policy was put in place to defer rent payments. Instead, that decision is left to the individual landlords, and negatively impacts those with a lower socioeconomic status. Further, access to clean water is not available to all Canadians, as 61 Indigenous communities across the country are under boil-water advisories. Evidently, access to social determinants of health are not equally distributed. At the federal level, short-term financial measures have been put in place to help Canadians stay afloat, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). With more than three million Canadians out of work, COVID-19 has highlighted how precariously many Canadians were living. While these economic efforts may be useful right now, they’re merely Band-Aid solutions that are unlikely to have any lasting impact on the social determinants of health. Like the curative health system, they are reactive, not proactive; curative, not preventive. That means many of the factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19 cannot be effectively managed because there’s no adequate social safety net in place. Creating a ‘new normal’ When health and economic systems are in disarray, there’s no better time to reconstruct from the bottom up. There is no doubt that a preventive approach to health care would not only lead to a healthier population and more equitable access to social services, it would also be less expensive than our current system in the long term. As the largest chunk of GDP is spent on health care, shifting money to other policy areas that influence the social determinants of health will require major restructuring. Because we have a federal health system, change often occurs slowly and large-scale reform rarely occurs at all. This is demonstrated by Canada’s lack of a national pharmacare program, mental health strategy and national home-care program, despite them all having been discussed for the last several decades. Social determinants of health include things like gender, race, education, childhood experiences, physical environment, employment, income, healthy habits, access to medical care and social supports. (Pixabay, Canva) In response to COVID-19, every Canadian province declared a state of emergency, and so it wasn’t deemed necessary by the federal government to invoke the Emergencies Act. However, invoking the act may have been an opportune time to expand the definition of medically necessary services and pass sweeping health reform measures, such as national health programs, without pushback from the provinces. Health policy should be all-encompassing and consider the bidirectional relationship between upstream (preventive) and downstream (curative) measures, and it should be analyzed in the context of social determinants of health, including gender, race, education and socioeconomic factors. Canada should seize the opportunity for collaboration between the provinces and among government, private sector and community groups. Now is the time for integrative policies over reactive measures; public programs over privatization; and embracing preventive measures to avert illness. Now is the time for change. We should never go back to “normal.” Health care Medical care Social determinants of health Coronavirus Health care system COVID-19 Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With the new academic year beginning shortly, students, faculty and staff returning to higher education or arriving for the first time face uncertainty. There is anxiety about a fall term like no other. Those of us responsible for ensuring the futures of post-secondary students have endured months of existential fears about student and employee health and safety, the efficacy of online teaching and virtual learning and what it all means for enrolment and revenue. Enough already. Our responses to the pandemic are helping us reimagine the future of higher education. Instead of lamenting what’s lost, let’s focus on what we’ve gained. Many of our adjustments to teaching and learning, student engagement and research to adapt to COVID-19 have shown us the way to a better version of higher education. The future our students deserve can be fashioned by heeding the lessons learned from experience over the past few months. Here is a blueprint. Create virtual content for the future Research suggests students are comfortable reading course materials online but prefer discussions and activities to occur face-to-face. Rather than a 50-minute lecture, virtual learning occurs best over short sprints such as ten or fifteen-minute modules. A possible blended learning model is one where learning proceeds seamlessly between a physical or virtual classroom and a continuously refreshed online resource library built with open-access resources. Instructors would not individually create new versions of the course each year, freeing them to mentor challenge-based learning. Experiential and lab learning is now possible online. For example, in the faculty of engineering at McMaster, we have collaborated with the educational innovation company Quanser to develop software that brings interactive and immersive lab experiences to students through virtual reality and gaming platforms. This fall, first-year engineering students will learn technical skills in virtual labs and apply them as part of a team in a virtual design studio. They’ll then collaborate with team members to address unique design challenges in areas such as autonomous vehicle design. McMaster engineering video. Right now, universities are undertaking such efforts independently. Political support and leadership are urgently required to encourage institutions to collaborate, produce and share virtual content. Developing multiple versions of the same subject matter is wasteful. Collaborations will yield more content and a greater variety of instruction for different learning styles. Engage students through virtual experiences The success of graduates depends on three ingredients — how they are taught, how they are mentored and what they experience. The shift to remote learning and social distancing has upended this recipe. Even before the pandemic, only a fraction of students made use of the wide range of curricular and extracurricular experiential learning opportunities offered on campuses. Now, to overcome constraints posed by distance, scheduling and convenience, these are provided online, a template that bodes well for supplementing future face-to-face engagement. New online programs are already enhancing the academic preparation of incoming students, offering them experiences and easing their social transition into virtual teams and groups. Students at McMaster University participated in a Change-A-Thon in June, and some teams proposed ways to increase revenue and expand ridership in a city bike share program. (Joey Coleman/Flickr), CC BY-SA Students are learning to create solutions that mitigate the social and economic impact of the virus. As students become more involved in addressing the complexity of the pandemic, they are also being trained to address other seemingly intractable challenges, such as climate change, clean water, affordable housing, widespread rapid transit and ubiquitous cybersecurity. End the credit hour American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie’s plans to establish a free pension system for post-secondary educators in 1906 led to a model that translated the contact time between an instructor and a learner into a measure of instructor workload. Even today, we measure workload through that credit hour model, but also use it to link “seat time” to a student’s learning and academic progression. University curricula are created by stacking courses that typically involve three credit hours of instructor workload. With blended learning, where part of the instruction is asynchronous, the credit hour is no longer a surrogate for instructor workload or student learning. Now, student transcripts emphasize academic progress through mastery of credit hours. This offers the opportunity to reconsider what is conveyed by the conventional academic transcript. The transcript should better reflect the learning, competencies and skills gained by the student, mirroring developments in professional fields where micro-credentialing has emerged as a way to reflect the kind of nimble and transferable skills that are most useful in today’s workplaces. Broader support for students’ futures Students are facing pandemic-related challenges. (Chris Montgomery/Unsplash), CC BY With job and financial losses, many more students can no longer afford higher education. Work opportunities like co-ops and internships that provide students with important professional competencies and skills have been scaled back by employers. Some students face food and housing insecurity, have poor health and wellness and require better digital access and devices. University emergency student aid is limited. To nurture future talent, some philanthropists have generously donated and governments must continue to help vulnerable learners thrive and support a bold reimagination of higher education. Renew a commitment to listening The pandemic has the power to humble us all and open our eyes and ears in new ways. We have been disoriented by COVID-19 and forced to listen more, empathize and fully imagine how to serve the needs of our students, employers and communities. Faculty, supported by offices of teaching and learning, are finding new ways to weave student concerns into course design. We must continue to listen carefully as we design curricula and teaching for the future.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Imagine drinking endless orange juice from concentrate because you’re convinced this is the best way to lose weight. In moderation, orange juice is fine, but it wouldn’t be a doctor’s first recommendation for a patient wanting to shed pounds. Much as we don’t want people to believe that the solution to the obesity pandemic is more orange juice, we also don’t want them to believe that the best way to fight climate change is to recycle more. While recycling and turning off the lights are good steps towards a more sustainable society, they are not nearly as important for the climate on an individual basis as reducing meat consumption, air travel and driving. Well-meaning individuals often make poor choices when it comes to reducing their carbon footprint. Air travel vs. recycling My colleagues and I surveyed students at the University of British Columbia and a sample of North Americans recruited from the online platform Mturk, to determine if they could correctly identify actions that would curb their individual greenhouse gas emissions. Our participants were more educated and more liberal than the general population but since we want to understand the perceptions of people who are at least a little motivated to engage in pro-climate actions, this is actually the right group of people to survey. In the study, we first asked participants to describe the single most effective action they could take to reduce the emissions that cause climate change. Many referred to driving less, which is indeed a high-impact action, and recycling, which is not. Few mentioned air travel, which can make up a huge portion of an individual’s carbon footprint. For example, a return flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, can generate over 4,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents. Political actions (like voting) that are needed to make large structural change also received little attention. Common misconceptions Next, we provided participants with 15 actions and asked them to categorize the actions as low-, medium- or high-impact (with low being less than one per cent of a person’s carbon footprint, and high being greater than five per cent). Actions involving personal vehicles were correctly perceived as quite important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But only 32 per cent of the sample correctly identified switching from plastic to canvas bags (the equivalent of orange juice for dieting) as a low-impact action. Reducing air travel and meat consumption were incorrectly ranked in the bottom half of the suggested actions. In line with past research on the “availability heuristic,” (a mental shortcut where people give extra importance to examples that spring to mind easily) people might have been focusing on choices where the harms are highly visible or on actions that are symbolic of environmentalism but not related to climate. For example, littering creates no emissions, but we found it was perceived similarly to a high-pollution flight across the Pacific Ocean. Focusing on what matters Finally, we asked participants to make trade-offs between sets of different actions, like comparing how long you would need to purchase food without any packaging in order to save the same amount of emissions as one year not eating meat. Around half of participants said one to two years. The real answer is at least a decade. We found that even people who were very concerned about climate change were unable to make accurate trade-offs. This is relevant for people who engage in moral licensing, “I recycle, so I can fly for vacation,” or people trying their best to optimize their carbon budget, “I drove out of my way to buy second-hand clothing because it has a smaller carbon footprint.” Read more: 5 ways families can help tackle climate change These misunderstandings matter. People who understand that meat has a large climate impact are more willing to eat less of it. In a study of Swedes who had given up or reduced their air travel, many cited the realization that flying occupied a large part of their “carbon budget” as a motivator for their choice. We want people to focus on meaningful actions so they don’t spend effort and money on distractions. But we also want people to adopt low-carbon lifestyles because people who do tend to support the policies that oblige everyone else to pollute less. Ezra Klein describes the value in changing the culture of more meat and bigger SUVs at the same time as we try to change policies: “We are not going to, as a society … vote for things that make us feel like bad people.” Lifestyle changes and more The term “carbon footprint” has come under criticism, because the oil industry used it in the past to redirect responsibility from itself onto consumers. But following the belief that climate hawks should oppose any tactic from a major polluter does not require abandoning every effort to change lifestyles. Some large corporations are worried that these lifestyle changes could cut deep into their bottom lines. Before the pandemic jeopardized the entire industry, airlines were taking careful steps to manage the lost business caused by a growing guilt (“flight shame”) among people for the carbon footprint of air travel. Even if you’re convinced that lifestyle change is a distraction from political action, and there is some peer-reviewed evidence to this effect, these results suggest that people are still putting disproportionate stock in trivial lifestyle changes, and not much in voting for climate policy. So what do we do? We can test ways to incentivize lifestyle change while increasing policy support, ideally with resources that don’t take away from political action. That could include projects on university campuses, in corporate offices and in grade schools (twelve-year-olds can’t vote, but they can learn what constitutes a sustainable meal and how to cook it). Read more: Flight shaming: how to spread the campaign that made Swedes give up flying for good In one study, for example, participants were given feedback on their food purchases in terms of “lightbulb minutes”: how much greenhouse gases are produced by one minute of lightbulb use. This led to a positive shift in their consumption choices. Similarly, people booking their flights could be told the fraction of their annual carbon budget that will be used up by a single trip. These approaches are helpful because they bring attention to climate change but don’t rely on individuals mastering the difficult subject of carbon footprints on their own. Climate activists, especially youth, tend to care about individual action. We might as well use that as an opportunity to encourage lifestyle changes that actually matter, and to increase support for tough climate policies that are already overdue.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger During the COVID-19 pandemic, words and phrases that have typically been limited to epidemiologists and public health professionals have entered the public sphere. Although we’ve rapidly accepted epidemiology-based news, the public hasn’t been given the chance to fully absorb what all these terms really mean. As with all disease tests, a false positive result on a COVID-19 test can cause undue stress on individuals as they try to navigate their diagnosis, take days off work and isolate from family. One high-profile example was Ohio Governor Mike DeWine whose false positive result led him to cancel a meeting with President Donald Trump. False negative test results are even more dangerous, as people may think it is safe and appropriate for them to engage in social activities. Of course, factors such as the type of test, whether the individual had symptoms before being tested and the timing of the test can also impact how well the test predicts whether someone is infected. Sensitivity and specificity are two extremely important scientific concepts for understanding the results of COVID-19 tests. In the epidemiological context, sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified. If 100 people have a disease, and the test identifies 90 of these people as having the disease, the sensitivity of the test is 90 per cent. A laboratory technical assistant at LifeLabs handles a specimen to be tested for COVID-19 after scanning its barcode upon receipt at the company’s lab, in Surrey, B.C., on March 26, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. If 100 people don’t have the disease, and the test correctly identifies 90 people as disease-free, the test has a specificity of 90 per cent. This simple table helps outline how sensitivity and specificity are calculated when the prevalence — the percentage of the population that actually has the disease — is 25 per cent (totals in bold): Sensitivity and specificity at 25 per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided A test sensitivity of 80 per cent can seem great for a newly released test (like for the made-up case numbers I reported above). Predictive value But these numbers don’t convey the whole message. The usefulness of a test in a population is not determined by its sensitivity and specificity. When we use sensitivity and specificity, we are figuring out how well a test works when we already know which people do, and don’t, have the disease. But the true value of a test in a real-world setting comes from its ability to correctly predict who is infected and who is not. This makes sense because in a real-world setting, we don’t know who truly has the disease — we rely on the test itself to tell us. We use the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of a test to summarize that test’s predictive ability. A health-care worker prepares to swab a man at a walk-in COVID-19 test clinic in Montreal North on May 10, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada and around the world. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes To drive the point home, think about this: in a population in which no one has the disease, even a test that is terrible at detecting anyone with the disease will appear to work great. It will “correctly” identify most people as not having the disease. This has more to do with how many people have the disease in a population (prevalence) rather than how well the test works. Using the same numbers as above, we can estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), but this time we focus on the row totals (in bold). The PPV is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of people identified as positive by the test. Positive and negative predictive value at 25 per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided The PPV is interpreted as the probability that someone that has tested positive actually has the disease. The NPV is the probability that someone that tested negative does not have the disease. Although sensitivity and specificity do not change as the proportion of diseased individuals changes in a population, the PPV and NPV are heavily dependent on the prevalence. Let’s see what happens when we redraw our disease table when the population prevalence sits at one per cent instead of 25 per cent (much closer to the true prevalence of COVID-19 in Canada). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV at one per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided So, when the disease has low prevalence, the PPV of the test can be very low. This means that the probability that someone that tested positive actually has COVID-19 is low. Of course, depending on the sensitivity, specificity and the prevalence in the population, the reverse can be true as well: someone that tested negative might not truly be disease-free. False positive and false negative tests in real life What does this mean as mass testing begins for COVID-19? At the very least it means the public should have clear information about the implications of false positives. All individuals should be aware of the possibility of a false positive or false negative test, especially as we move to a heavier reliance on testing this fall to inform our actions and decisions. As we can see using some simple tables and math above, the PPV and NPV can be limiting even in the face of a “good” test with high sensitivity and specificity. Without adequate understanding of the science behind testing and why false positives and false negatives happen, we might drive the public to further mistrust — and even question the usefulness — of public health and testing.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With kids heading back to school in masks this year, many parents are wondering about different types of masks and how to care for them. Here are answers to some of the most common mask questions. Are cloth or disposable masks best for all-day wear? When considering the best choice of face covering for a child to wear for the duration of a school day, one should look at the mask fabric, whether it absorbs sweat and oil secreted from the skin and is not irritating to the skin, and the size of the face mask and whether it fits well on the child’s face. It is important to pay attention to the fabric, design and fit of the cloth face masks. (Unsplash/Insung Yoon) Both cloth and disposable face masks, when worn properly on the face with little to no gaps around the nose, cheeks or underneath the chin, perform equally well in terms of reducing the respiratory droplets expelled by the wearer. Therefore, it is reasonable to look out for cloth masks that may offer the wearer less face irritation. However, it is important to pay attention to the fabric, design and fit of the cloth face masks. Tests have shown cotton, flannel and polyester face masks with two or more layers filter out 80 per cent of the respiratory droplets, but neck gaiters did not filter out the respiratory droplets. On the contrary, neck gaiters appear to increase the number of micro-droplets filtered through them, likely by breaking up larger droplets. In addition, cloth masks are offered in different sizes (adult, youth and kid sizes) and disposable masks (made from plastic material such as polypropylene) may only come in a single size, which is often too big for children. Hence, cloth masks could be the best option for children. However, it should be recognized that wearing a face mask, no matter how comfortable it may be, still does not come naturally to any of us and can cause discomfort when worn for long hours at a stretch, especially for young children. It’s a good idea to take breaks from it whenever possible, such as during lunch and recesses. How often should cloth masks be washed? And do I have to wash them separately from other laundry? For cloth masks, the frequency of washing depends on the use of the mask. If you wear the mask indoors or outdoors where you are exposed to close interactions with other people, interactions with many people or for long hours, consider washing the mask at the end of the day or put it aside and wash it later. Laundry detergent will destroy the virus particles. You can think of virus particles like oil stains on your clothes. The effect that a detergent has on oil stains is similar to its effect on the virus particles: it will break the virus particles apart and render them non-infectious. As such, it is safe to wash your cloth masks with the other clothes. To add an extra assurance that the virus particles are completely destroyed, you can dry masks in the dryer together with other clothes. Research has shown that heat (60-95C) destroys the virus particles. Make sure the fabric of your masks can sustain the heat of the dryer. Cloth face masks can be machine washed or hand washed. (Unsplash/Vera Davidova) Cloth face masks can also be washed very effectively by hand using soap (or dishwashing detergent) and hot water. Let them air dry in a clean place, and iron them once they are dry to offer a similar effect to the dryer. If a face mask is used only for an hour or two, and it is handled carefully and is not touched or removed very often, it can be re-used for a second day if it’s stored in a cloth bag or cardboard box (a porous material, not plastic, so it can dry out). This might be a better option for high school students than younger children. Where should kids put their mask when they take it off? And, is it safe to put it back on after lunch or recess, or do kids need more than one mask per day? Provide children with two masks to take to school so they have a spare in case one is lost, damaged or soiled. (Pexels/August de Richelieu) How the face mask is treated during the intermittent breaks from it, such as during lunch and recesses, is also very important. To remove the mask, first wash or sanitize hands. Then carefully remove the mask from the face, fold it inward in two and place it in a cloth bag or inside a clean plastic box that can be washed or disinfected, respectively. It is very safe to use the same cloth face mask again the same day, provided that it is stored properly and it is not soiled or damaged. Face masks should be personal protective gear, not to be shared with (or handled by) anyone else. It is advisable to provide children with two face masks, so they will have a spare in case one gets compromised (soiled, damaged or lost). How should masks be managed at the end of the school day? School kids will be in contact, albeit at a safe distance, with a number of kids from the same cohort. In addition, they will probably touch their face mask often in order to remove it and put it back on as they go through different parts of the day at school, such as lunch, recesses and outside teaching. They will likely be breathing through the masks for several hours, although not at a stretch. Considering these factors, cloth masks must be washed at the end of the school day or put aside (safely) to be washed when possible with other laundry. Think of the face mask the same way you would underwear: wash after wearing for a day. However, if children are using a disposable face mask, this mask should be properly disposed of at the end of the day. Both cloth and disposable masks help prevent respiratory droplets from escaping. (Pixabay) In the case of the cloth face mask, at the end of the school day (or at the end of the school bus ride, or taking public transit) the mask should be put in a resealable bag (labelled “soiled mask”) and either washed upon arrival at home, or put safely with other laundry and washed when time permits. I would recommend equipping children with two bags: one to be used for the clean face masks (where the spare mask can be kept), and the other to carry the used one (this could be a resealable bag). Can I clip my child’s mask to her sleeve or bag? Absolutely not! One only needs to see how much “cleaning” the child’s sleeves do by the end of the day; you do not want the child to breathe in all that dirt. We should be concerned not only about COVID-19, but also about other potential diseases, including respiratory diseases, that kids are prone to, such as strep infection, pneumonia and flu, to name a few. If carrying a cloth bag around the shoulder, for storing the face mask when outside for recess, is not something that your child feels comfortable with, then use clothing (pants or shirts) that have pockets (deep enough) to carry the face mask. Children should be taught to fold the mask inward, in two, when storing (in a cloth bag, box, resealable bag or pocket), so the inner portion of the mask is protected from dirt and contamination as much as possible (and ask the child to keep their mask pocket clean and not use it for any other items). A lot of attention is placed on face masks, but we should not forget the clothing that kids wear at school. Although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contaminated surfaces (including clothes) poses lesser risk than transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets, the hygiene of the clothes that kids wear is very important too, especially when kids live with elderly family members. I strongly recommend that children wash their hands and remove their school clothes upon arrival at home and change into clothes designated to be used at home only.

I usually do fine at in-person interviews but for some reason talking to a robot makes me choke up and stammer. Does anyone have any advice for improving my HireVue skills? Is there a website where I can practise?” Reddit user Companies are shifting towards virtual hiring. With staggering unemployment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are looking for work for the first time in years. Those returning to the market may be shocked to find hiring has increasingly moved online. This has further increased during the pandemic. Adapting to remote work, 80 per cent of recruiters surveyed by a recruitment company reported using video in their interview processes. One virtual hiring trend rapidly gaining traction is the asynchronous video interview, or AVI. No conversation An AVI is different from a Skype or Zoom interview, because it involves no online conversation with an interviewer or organization. Applicants receive an email invitation to participate, click a link and then record audio or video responses to the questions. Even before the pandemic, AVIs were becoming more common. For example, one common interview platform, HireVue, works with more than a third of Fortune 100 companies, and has conducted over 10 million interviews. AVIs can be convenient for organizations: They may be faster and cheaper than traditional interviews, may increase the number of applicants and can reportedly decrease the amount of time required to hire someone, as well as reducing travel costs. AVIs can increase the number of applicants for a job. (Piqsels) After the AVI, interviewers score the videos and pick the top candidates, or in some cases, a computer algorithm screens and scores the videos. Many companies are adopting AVIs, and job seekers are likely to encounter them. Applicants may have negative opinions about AVIs and the companies that use them, but AVIs vary widely in their design. For example, applicants may have more or less time to respond or prepare their answers, may have the chance to re-record answers or may be allowed to take breaks. While companies are increasingly adopting AVIs, research has lagged behind. How should organizations administer AVIs? How can applicants be successful in AVIs? Our research labs have been examining these questions. Here are our recommendations for applicants and organizations: Applicants If there is a practice question, use it! Interacting with a camera can be uncomfortable, but remember that a human evaluator will likely see your recordings. Make sure to engage non-verbally with the camera (look at it, smile, etc.) and consider the impression you might create (avoid looking down, cursing when frustrated). Practise shorter or longer answers to common questions (for example, describe your experience in one minute and then three minutes). We provide a link to a free practice AVI at the bottom of this article. If you can choose when to complete the AVI, you re-record your answers or have unlimited preparation time, use these resources as you see fit. If you are experiencing anxiety, take a break, write down where you struggled, and try again. Consider your video background and appearance. Human evaluators can use your background to judge you, and attractiveness and style are even more important in an AVI. Choose a neutral background. And, while it’s tempting to dress casually, particularly if at home, dress as you would for an in-person interview. Present yourself honestly. Research indicates that the best way to make a positive impression is to focus on honestly describing and promoting the skills, abilities and fit with the company you have rather than “faking it.” Organizations Design AVIs to create a positive applicant experience. Candidates form impressions of a company based on how it hires people. Using AVIs can backfire if top applicants decline the AVI invitation or end up turning down a job offer. Design AVIs to make things fairer for applicants. For instance, provide a practice question for applicants to get used to the platform. Offer flexible options for candidates, such as when to complete the interview, re-recording opportunities or more time to prepare before recording. Let them know what to expect. This can be helpful for applicants who are anxious, have child-care responsibilities or face pandemic-related challenges. Technology is no substitute for proven best practices. Interviews are most likely to result in a good hire when they ask behavioural or situational questions aligned with the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary for the job rather than questions like: “What are your greatest strengths?” Be cautious about using artificial intelligence to score candidates. While some AVI companies offer to automatically score interviews using a computer algorithm, the jury is still out on how effective these are. What is actually being scored can be unclear. There is new legislation about disclosure when using AI to evaluate candidates. Although all algorithms are different, there is a risk for bias against minorities and gender stereotyping. When considering using AI, get information from the AVI company about these issues. Read more: Facial analysis AI is being used in job interviews – it will probably reinforce inequality Be cautious of biases. Because one can quit watching an AVI at any point, there is a temptation to make snap decisions. This might lead to biased decisions. For example, raters may conflate poor connection quality (either out of applicants’ control or indicating lower socio-economic status) as a lack of competence. Similarly, the biasing effects of physical characteristics are particularly exacerbated. Video backgrounds can also convey personal information (for example, political affiliation) that can unfairly affect hiring decisions.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger During the COVID-19 pandemic, words and phrases that have typically been limited to epidemiologists and public health professionals have entered the public sphere. Although we’ve rapidly accepted epidemiology-based news, the public hasn’t been given the chance to fully absorb what all these terms really mean. As with all disease tests, a false positive result on a COVID-19 test can cause undue stress on individuals as they try to navigate their diagnosis, take days off work and isolate from family. One high-profile example was Ohio Governor Mike DeWine whose false positive result led him to cancel a meeting with President Donald Trump. False negative test results are even more dangerous, as people may think it is safe and appropriate for them to engage in social activities. Of course, factors such as the type of test, whether the individual had symptoms before being tested and the timing of the test can also impact how well the test predicts whether someone is infected. Sensitivity and specificity are two extremely important scientific concepts for understanding the results of COVID-19 tests. In the epidemiological context, sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified. If 100 people have a disease, and the test identifies 90 of these people as having the disease, the sensitivity of the test is 90 per cent. A laboratory technical assistant at LifeLabs handles a specimen to be tested for COVID-19 after scanning its barcode upon receipt at the company’s lab, in Surrey, B.C., on March 26, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. If 100 people don’t have the disease, and the test correctly identifies 90 people as disease-free, the test has a specificity of 90 per cent. This simple table helps outline how sensitivity and specificity are calculated when the prevalence — the percentage of the population that actually has the disease — is 25 per cent (totals in bold): Sensitivity and specificity at 25 per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided A test sensitivity of 80 per cent can seem great for a newly released test (like for the made-up case numbers I reported above). Predictive value But these numbers don’t convey the whole message. The usefulness of a test in a population is not determined by its sensitivity and specificity. When we use sensitivity and specificity, we are figuring out how well a test works when we already know which people do, and don’t, have the disease. But the true value of a test in a real-world setting comes from its ability to correctly predict who is infected and who is not. This makes sense because in a real-world setting, we don’t know who truly has the disease — we rely on the test itself to tell us. We use the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of a test to summarize that test’s predictive ability. A health-care worker prepares to swab a man at a walk-in COVID-19 test clinic in Montreal North on May 10, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada and around the world. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes To drive the point home, think about this: in a population in which no one has the disease, even a test that is terrible at detecting anyone with the disease will appear to work great. It will “correctly” identify most people as not having the disease. This has more to do with how many people have the disease in a population (prevalence) rather than how well the test works. Using the same numbers as above, we can estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), but this time we focus on the row totals (in bold). The PPV is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of people identified as positive by the test. Positive and negative predictive value at 25 per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided The PPV is interpreted as the probability that someone that has tested positive actually has the disease. The NPV is the probability that someone that tested negative does not have the disease. Although sensitivity and specificity do not change as the proportion of diseased individuals changes in a population, the PPV and NPV are heavily dependent on the prevalence. Let’s see what happens when we redraw our disease table when the population prevalence sits at one per cent instead of 25 per cent (much closer to the true prevalence of COVID-19 in Canada). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV at one per cent disease prevalence. (Priyanka Gogna), Author provided So, when the disease has low prevalence, the PPV of the test can be very low. This means that the probability that someone that tested positive actually has COVID-19 is low. Of course, depending on the sensitivity, specificity and the prevalence in the population, the reverse can be true as well: someone that tested negative might not truly be disease-free. False positive and false negative tests in real life What does this mean as mass testing begins for COVID-19? At the very least it means the public should have clear information about the implications of false positives. All individuals should be aware of the possibility of a false positive or false negative test, especially as we move to a heavier reliance on testing this fall to inform our actions and decisions. As we can see using some simple tables and math above, the PPV and NPV can be limiting even in the face of a “good” test with high sensitivity and specificity. Without adequate understanding of the science behind testing and why false positives and false negatives happen, we might drive the public to further mistrust — and even question the usefulness — of public health and testing.

Partners University of Toronto provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation CA. University of Toronto provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA-FR. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger For about a month now, I’ve had the government’s official COVID Alert app installed on my phone. It is active and monitoring. Each week I get a notification telling me I haven’t had contact with anybody who tested positive for the coronavirus. That’s good news but it isn’t too surprising. First of all, I work from home and barely leave the house. But I do so occasionally to get a haircut and buy some groceries. Second, even if one of the people I have had contact with was infected, I would only find out if they either have the app installed or they enter their positive result into their app. Both of those steps lower the chances of the app doing its job. In its first month, there were only 2.2 million downloads and 90 infections. As we confront a second wave of COVID-19 infections, how do we change that? Challenges I work with many entrepreneurs through the Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Toronto and we know that getting people to download an app can be challenging. They have to know about it. They have to remember to download it. And they have to remember to set it up. Invariably, what we try to do is get people who like an app to tell others to use the app too. These social referrals sometimes work on their own and in other cases, incentives are given such as a discount on services sold through the app. Ironically, to encourage people to download the COVID Alert app, we want to use viral processes as we’re attempting to contain an actual virus. And, yes, that’s a challenge because many of these app downloads are driven by people sharing thoughts when they are together — and most of us are living in relative isolation at the moment. It’s difficult to show someone an effective app when there are few people in your bubble. (Piqsels) To get the COVID Alert app installed, therefore, we need a push. Apple and Google are taking small steps in this direction. They will both have updates to smartphone operating systems that will allow people to be alerted to exposures without having an app installed. But they will still need an official app if they want to report a COVID-19 infection. Spurring the app to go viral The fact that private companies are working on this is good news. The COVID Alert app was built off an open-source base provided by Shopify that anticipated the need well ahead of the government. Now we need those very same companies to step in to get the app to go viral. They have levers to do this. Imagine a company with rewards points — like credit cards, airlines and supermarkets — offering bonus points for anyone installing the app. This might require some software but it could also be done at points of sale or upon delivery of your meals, with humans verifying an app install. Or maybe Apple or Google could offer incentives right in their app stores. There may be some privacy hurdles to overcome, but companies aren’t generally shy about trying to sell us stuff. Read more: To change coronavirus behaviours, think like a marketer We could go further by making clear that installing the app is a socially valuable act and, like wearing a mask, better for other people than it is for us. Can we ensure people personally benefit after installing the app? One possibility might be to anticipate a situation where things might go the other way, as some have suggested for convalescent plasma donations. In that case, to encourage people who had already had COVID-19 to donate their blood for use to help others fight the virus, economists suggested that they be given a voucher for their own family or friends to move to the front of the line for a treatment. A recovered COVID-19 patient donates blood in Panama City in May 2020. The blood product donated from recovered COVID-19 patients, known as convalescent plasma, may have antibodies that can help those critically ill from the virus. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco) If we should ever have a COVID-19 vaccine, it could take months to distribute. Those most in need will likely get it first, but the majority of us will have to wait. What if people could jump ahead in the queue based on how many months they’ve been using the app? In other words, we can make app installs a means of “paying it forward” and the return is that we can get vaccinated earlier. Infections must be entered into the app If we can push app downloads to a majority of the population, that will make a difference. Nonetheless, we’ll also need to worry about entering COVID-19 infections into the app as well. In South Korea, where they’ve done so well containing the virus, these infections are automatically entered when someone tests positive. A family wearing face masks to help protect against the spread of the coronavirus enjoy themselves at a park in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) Canada’s privacy laws don’t allow that. But we can do better. For instance, we could at least have the option for something other than self-reporting. If a test is positive, the person involved can be asked to enter the result right then and there. Alternatively, there might be a way of pushing that result to their app with their permission. Finding out you’re COVID-19 positive isn’t likely to be a great moment, and we can hardly expect people’s first thought to be to report their diagnosis to the app. But if we use nudges and other pushes, we can overcome some of the friction. As school begins, this is even more critical. The sooner we know about exposures, the sooner we can take action and keep things from getting out of hand. Schoolkids need to have the app installed on their phones right now, and they need to be allowed to carry those phones around all day. Before snapping those back-to-school photos and posting them to Facebook, parents should first ensure their children have the app installed. As we head into a second wave, the rest of us should install it immediately too. Technology Coronavirus Social isolation COVID-19 Contact tracing COVID-19 app Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In 2019, the board of directors of McDonald’s Corp. took the unusual but bold and moral decision to dismiss its CEO Steve Easterbrook after he revealed he’d had a consensual relationship with a co-worker. McDonald’s had a policy forbidding managers from having “intimate interactions” with direct or indirect employees. Easterbrook readily admitted the relationship and cited his desire to adhere to the company’s code of conduct as motivating his admission. In an email to all employees after the board announced his dismissal, he wrote: “This was a mistake. Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.” The dismissal of a CEO is never something that boards take lightly, especially when it is sudden — and when the CEO is wildly successful. Under Easterbrook’s leadership, McDonald’s updated its menus and restaurants to reflect contemporary tastes, expanded delivery and mobile payments and otherwise evolved into a more modern organization. The market rewarded these efforts by doubling the share price during his tenure. Easterbrook was also rewarded with compensation in the tens of millions of dollars annually. Impacts shareholder wealth Easterbrook’s dismissal was seen by some as a triumph of morality and judgment — albeit at the expense of shareholder wealth. McDonald’s shares went down by as much as three per cent (US$4 billion value) shortly after the announcement. McDonald’s share prices took a hit in the fallout of the departure of CEO Steve Easterbrook. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) The board’s dismissal without cause was deemed appropriate by media and investors under the circumstances and Easterbrook walked away with a severance package worth about US$42 million. Fast forward to 2020. The board’s ongoing investigation has revealed, among other things, that Easterbrook sent explicit photos from his McDonald’s email account, purportedly lied about other sexual relationships with co-workers and approved an extraordinary stock grant worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one McDonald’s employee “… shortly after their first sexual encounter and within days of their second.” As a result, the board belatedly filed a lawsuit against Easterbrook seeking to claw back the severance it had awarded eight months earlier, maintaining the CEO should have been dismissed for cause. Easterbrook responded in a court filing that the company and board already had all of this information — and had his entire email account and history stored on its company servers when it negotiated his severance package. ‘Bro’ behaviour is infectious So, once again, toxic “bro” behaviour, as we have seen at Uber and other organizations, infects an iconic organization, leaving the courts to decide. Certainly, Easterbrook is to blame for, by his own admission, breaking the company’s code of conduct and, more importantly, the values it set for behaviour. However, the board shares responsibility for its singular failure to observe, recognize and act on what emerged as an ongoing, long-term, cultural and possibly legal fiasco. Read more: McDonald's upheaval is a stern reminder to CEOs about ethics In 2020, the business world is regrettably replete with examples of poor CEO behaviour, and the #MeToo movement is both widespread and widely known. So why do these situations persist? More to the point, why do boards seem to be constantly surprised by such egregious conduct? Corporate governance focuses a lot on “tone at the top.” Boards and directors are told and aware that they are under constant and unremitting scrutiny. Their acts — tacit and explicit — filter throughout their organizations, shareholders and stakeholders. They are the instigators, nurturers and custodians of one of an organization’s most critical and enduring assets: its culture. So how can a board best ensure it discharges its responsibilities to corporate culture in an ethical, responsible and credible manner? How can boards best ensure, observe and embody the culture they desire for their organization? We suggest three key strategies: 1. CEO selection The board sets culture through its selection of the CEO. Boards are fascinating organisms inasmuch as they are a group that has only one employee — the CEO. Finding, recruiting, retaining and eventually replacing the organization’s chief executive is the board’s solemn function. The CEO defines and leads the organization’s strategy. Through their behaviour and expressed beliefs, they come to define and perpetuate the organization’s culture. As such, when considering the organization’s succession plan, the board needs to be explicit about the values they’re seeking in a CEO — and test for those values not only through interviews with candidates, but through interviews with people they have worked with, as well as with clients and suppliers. It also goes without saying that vetting includes a thorough background check. Past behaviour is one of the best predictors of future behaviour. If an aspiring CEO has inappropriate behaviour in their past, a thorough, confidential investigation before they are hired will likely reveal some of it. One strategy that board members should employ is getting to know the companies they oversee. Shutterstock 2. Compensation schemes Once the CEO has been selected, the board negotiates a comprehensive compensation package. This package is based on a number of short, medium and long-term incentives and composed of both cash and shares or options. Compensation research is clear in concluding that executives are remarkable in their ability to discern which behaviour is being compensated, and in turn, engaging in that very behaviour. In developing compensation schemes, boards should include behaviour targets (such as employee engagement and net promoter scores) in addition to more traditional performance-based metrics. They may even include a morals clause. In evaluating the CEO’s performance annually, the board should keep checking on the CEO’s behaviour through both interviews and observation. The board should also anticipate and plan for involuntary dismissal of the CEO and include clawback mechanisms or even phased payouts in severance provisions. 3. Get out of the boardroom Many boards hold at least one meeting per year offsite. This has the effect of familiarizing directors with the organization’s operations, as well as signalling to the organization’s employees and other stakeholders the board’s engagement with the entire organization, no matter where. Unfortunately, these off-site meetings are all too often highly scripted and co-ordinated affairs, more reminiscent of a theatre performance than a genuine pulse check. Directors, individually and collectively, must make it a priority to see the organization’s operations from all perspectives. They should interact with employees, suppliers, customers and all stakeholders on a regular, unscripted and perhaps even unplanned basis. Only by doing so will they get a thorough idea of the company’s culture. One highly successful director we know bases their decision to join a board partly by trying the organization’s products or services as a customer and witnessing first-hand how frontline employees perform. Another CEO provides every director with an all-access security pass and keycard to all of the organization’s workplaces, encouraging these directors to drop in unannounced to see operations firsthand. The situation at McDonald’s did not arise spontaneously or suddenly. There are suggestions that it also extends beyond the CEO. Easterbrook’s personality did not undergo a radical transformation when he became the CEO at McDonald’s. There is an old adage that says “the fish rots from the head down.” McDonald’s board failed in its duty to create, nurture, monitor and sustain a positive, healthy organizational culture. Easterbrook’s behaviour — and the ensuing impact on the entire company — was the result. Governance Corporate governance CEO Uber McDonald's Board of Directors Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger On Sept. 4, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that we will have a vaccine for COVID-19 “before the end of the year and maybe even before Nov. 1.” As an election looms in the United States, the declaration fuelled worry that a COVID-19 vaccine may be approved before scientific vetting is complete. In the United States, review and licensure of vaccines is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But the agency’s handling of emergency use authorizations for two anti-malaria drugs and convalescent blood plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 have led to claims it has become politicized. Blood samples from volunteers are handled in the laboratory at Imperial College in London, on July 30, 2020. Imperial College is working on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Such is the worry about the impartiality of the FDA that pharmaceutical companies drew a line in the sand and pledged publicly to “only submit [a vaccine] for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study.” “Hell has frozen over,” remarked commentators. But what is a Phase 3 clinical study? And how does scientific testing provide us with reliable evidence that vaccines not only work but are safe? Vaccine development Vaccine development can be thought of as the process of separating the parts of an infectious agent that make us sick, from those that induce an immune response and protect us from future infection. As this separation can be accomplished in myriad ways, vaccines are diverse. Vaccine candidates for COVID-19 illustrate these diverse approaches. Some, such as SinoPharm’s inactivated coronavirus vaccine, use killed whole coronavirus. Others, such as the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, modify a different virus (in this case, chimpanzee adenovirus) to express coronavirus proteins. Yet others, such as Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, use only small bits of viral genetic material. In Canada, the oversight of vaccines is shared by Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The scientific evaluation of vaccines involves animal testing, human clinical trials and post-approval surveillance. In many regards, the evaluation of vaccines is the same as the process for drugs. Because vaccines are given to healthy people, however, there is an even greater emphasis in vaccine testing on safety. Animal testing The first step in evaluating a vaccine is animal testing. Animals are given differing doses of vaccine to check for adverse events and an immune response. As the virus that causes COVID-19 is new, there was no animal model for the disease. Recent work has demonstrated that ferrets, cats and some non-human primates are prone to infection and can spread it to others. Animal testing provides information about safety (and perhaps efficacy) before a vaccine is tested on humans. What is vaccine development, and how can it be done faster during a pandemic? Human clinical trials Human testing in clinical trials is divided into three phases. Ensuring the safety of a vaccine is the prime concern through all phases of clinical trials. Vaccine efficacy is evaluated in different ways across the trial spectrum. Early-phase trials look for the production of antibodies against the virus, while late-phase trials evaluate whether the vaccine in fact prevents people from getting sick. Phase 1 trials are the first evaluations of a vaccine in humans. These trials recruit 10 to 100 healthy volunteers who receive different doses of vaccine. Common adverse events to a vaccine include redness or soreness at the injection site, muscle pains, headache and fever. Blood is also drawn from the volunteers to assess the immune response to the vaccine, particularly the rise in antibodies and whether antibody levels are similar to those in people who have had the disease. Phase 2 vaccine trials are similar to Phase 1 trials in terms of their focus on adverse events and immune response. Phase 2 trials, however, include hundreds of healthy volunteers who are more diverse to give a better indication of the safety and immune response in people likely to receive the vaccine in the future. Pharmacist Michael Witte, left, gives Rebecca Sirull, right, a shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Sirull was the third patient to receive the shot in the study. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) As Phase 1 and 2 trials involve relatively small numbers of people, they only give us information on vaccine side-effects that are very common (affecting more than 10 per cent of people) and common (affecting more than one per cent of people). Vaccine efficacy is only evaluated indirectly through measuring antibody levels. It is only the Phase 3 trials that can provide a pivotal demonstration that a vaccine both works and is safe. Phase 3 vaccine trials are large randomized controlled trials conducted in the community. In these trials people either receive the vaccine or a placebo. If fewer people who received the vaccine become sick compared to those who received placebo, we have direct evidence that the vaccine prevents disease. Read more: Ethics must not be ignored when testing COVID-19 vaccines A Phase 3 trial may involve tens of thousands of volunteers who receive the vaccine, further providing reliable information on adverse events, including those that are uncommon (affecting fewer than one per cent of people) or rare (affecting fewer than 0.1 per cent of people). A vaccine may be licensed for use after a successful Phase 3 trial. Of the 321 vaccines for COVID-19 in development, 27 are in Phase 1 or 2 trials and six are being evaluated in Phase 3 trials. In total, these trials seek to enrol 280,000 people from 34 countries. No COVID-19 vaccine has been licensed in Canada or the United States. Post-approval surveillance Once a vaccine is licensed, continued monitoring for safety is critical. Reliable detection of very rare (affecting fewer than 0.01 per cent of people) vaccine adverse events requires information on hundreds of thousands of people. The Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System monitors the safety of marketed vaccines, publishes reports regularly and identifies the need for further study should a safety issue be identified. Provided that a COVID-19 vaccine successfully navigates human clinical trials and is subjected to continuing safety monitoring after it is licensed, we have good grounds to believe that the vaccine both works and is safe.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With kids heading back to school in masks this year, many parents are wondering about different types of masks and how to care for them. Here are answers to some of the most common mask questions. Are cloth or disposable masks best for all-day wear? When considering the best choice of face covering for a child to wear for the duration of a school day, one should look at the mask fabric, whether it absorbs sweat and oil secreted from the skin and is not irritating to the skin, and the size of the face mask and whether it fits well on the child’s face. It is important to pay attention to the fabric, design and fit of the cloth face masks. (Unsplash/Insung Yoon) Both cloth and disposable face masks, when worn properly on the face with little to no gaps around the nose, cheeks or underneath the chin, perform equally well in terms of reducing the respiratory droplets expelled by the wearer. Therefore, it is reasonable to look out for cloth masks that may offer the wearer less face irritation. However, it is important to pay attention to the fabric, design and fit of the cloth face masks. Tests have shown cotton, flannel and polyester face masks with two or more layers filter out 80 per cent of the respiratory droplets, but neck gaiters did not filter out the respiratory droplets. On the contrary, neck gaiters appear to increase the number of micro-droplets filtered through them, likely by breaking up larger droplets. In addition, cloth masks are offered in different sizes (adult, youth and kid sizes) and disposable masks (made from plastic material such as polypropylene) may only come in a single size, which is often too big for children. Hence, cloth masks could be the best option for children. However, it should be recognized that wearing a face mask, no matter how comfortable it may be, still does not come naturally to any of us and can cause discomfort when worn for long hours at a stretch, especially for young children. It’s a good idea to take breaks from it whenever possible, such as during lunch and recesses. How often should cloth masks be washed? And do I have to wash them separately from other laundry? For cloth masks, the frequency of washing depends on the use of the mask. If you wear the mask indoors or outdoors where you are exposed to close interactions with other people, interactions with many people or for long hours, consider washing the mask at the end of the day or put it aside and wash it later. Laundry detergent will destroy the virus particles. You can think of virus particles like oil stains on your clothes. The effect that a detergent has on oil stains is similar to its effect on the virus particles: it will break the virus particles apart and render them non-infectious. As such, it is safe to wash your cloth masks with the other clothes. To add an extra assurance that the virus particles are completely destroyed, you can dry masks in the dryer together with other clothes. Research has shown that heat (60-95C) destroys the virus particles. Make sure the fabric of your masks can sustain the heat of the dryer. Cloth face masks can be machine washed or hand washed. (Unsplash/Vera Davidova) Cloth face masks can also be washed very effectively by hand using soap (or dishwashing detergent) and hot water. Let them air dry in a clean place, and iron them once they are dry to offer a similar effect to the dryer. If a face mask is used only for an hour or two, and it is handled carefully and is not touched or removed very often, it can be re-used for a second day if it’s stored in a cloth bag or cardboard box (a porous material, not plastic, so it can dry out). This might be a better option for high school students than younger children. Where should kids put their mask when they take it off? And, is it safe to put it back on after lunch or recess, or do kids need more than one mask per day? Provide children with two masks to take to school so they have a spare in case one is lost, damaged or soiled. (Pexels/August de Richelieu) How the face mask is treated during the intermittent breaks from it, such as during lunch and recesses, is also very important. To remove the mask, first wash or sanitize hands. Then carefully remove the mask from the face, fold it inward in two and place it in a cloth bag or inside a clean plastic box that can be washed or disinfected, respectively. It is very safe to use the same cloth face mask again the same day, provided that it is stored properly and it is not soiled or damaged. Face masks should be personal protective gear, not to be shared with (or handled by) anyone else. It is advisable to provide children with two face masks, so they will have a spare in case one gets compromised (soiled, damaged or lost). How should masks be managed at the end of the school day? School kids will be in contact, albeit at a safe distance, with a number of kids from the same cohort. In addition, they will probably touch their face mask often in order to remove it and put it back on as they go through different parts of the day at school, such as lunch, recesses and outside teaching. They will likely be breathing through the masks for several hours, although not at a stretch. Considering these factors, cloth masks must be washed at the end of the school day or put aside (safely) to be washed when possible with other laundry. Think of the face mask the same way you would underwear: wash after wearing for a day. However, if children are using a disposable face mask, this mask should be properly disposed of at the end of the day. Both cloth and disposable masks help prevent respiratory droplets from escaping. (Pixabay) In the case of the cloth face mask, at the end of the school day (or at the end of the school bus ride, or taking public transit) the mask should be put in a resealable bag (labelled “soiled mask”) and either washed upon arrival at home, or put safely with other laundry and washed when time permits. I would recommend equipping children with two bags: one to be used for the clean face masks (where the spare mask can be kept), and the other to carry the used one (this could be a resealable bag). Can I clip my child’s mask to her sleeve or bag? Absolutely not! One only needs to see how much “cleaning” the child’s sleeves do by the end of the day; you do not want the child to breathe in all that dirt. We should be concerned not only about COVID-19, but also about other potential diseases, including respiratory diseases, that kids are prone to, such as strep infection, pneumonia and flu, to name a few. If carrying a cloth bag around the shoulder, for storing the face mask when outside for recess, is not something that your child feels comfortable with, then use clothing (pants or shirts) that have pockets (deep enough) to carry the face mask. Children should be taught to fold the mask inward, in two, when storing (in a cloth bag, box, resealable bag or pocket), so the inner portion of the mask is protected from dirt and contamination as much as possible (and ask the child to keep their mask pocket clean and not use it for any other items). A lot of attention is placed on face masks, but we should not forget the clothing that kids wear at school. Although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contaminated surfaces (including clothes) poses lesser risk than transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets, the hygiene of the clothes that kids wear is very important too, especially when kids live with elderly family members. I strongly recommend that children wash their hands and remove their school clothes upon arrival at home and change into clothes designated to be used at home only.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With just a month left until the November 3 US presidential election, contracting the virus could have politically positive or negative consequences for President Donald Trump. These will, of course, be contingent on how severe the president’s illness becomes. But we should not count him out and Biden in just yet. Here are the ways the diagnosis could swing the election either way for Trump. Negative Trump’s days in isolation will halt his intense campaign schedule. Trump was much better at energising crowds in airport hangers than Joe Biden has been. This advantage is now gone. Trump is a sick man. Campaigning in any form requires robust health. Any physical advantage born of being the younger and fitter of the two candidates has now gone. Because he has often disparaged the virulence of the disease, the president faces the public humiliation of being its victim. Trump does not deal well with humiliation – the excoriating account of his childhood, as told by his estranged niece, Mary L. Trump, is replete with examples of the young Donald dishing out but being unable to take humiliation. Trump has traded on his strong man image for decades. If he gets a bad dose, he will look every bit and more of his 74 years. If his experience is like that of Boris Johnson, Trump could well be out of action for weeks with the attendant psychological challenge of recovery weighing on him. The British PM, several intimates have observed, is still in recovery, still cognitively and emotionally impaired by his personal fight with COVID-19. Trump thrives on rallies but won’t be able to attend them for at least a couple of weeks. AAP/AP/ Jack Rendulich Positive There are also potential political advantages in Trump’s COVID diagnosis. Because of the virus, Joe Biden was already cautious about face-to-face campaigning. His younger opponent falling ill may well keep Biden more basement-bound and less willing to crisscross the battleground states. Trump is not the first leader to catch the virus. While Boris Johnson became very sick, Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, had a relatively mild dose. He was able to claim from personal experience how few people who catch the virus are actually killed by it. This has been Trump’s basic refrain over the course of the pandemic. Catching and recovering from the virus will prove he was right all along. Lockdowns, he will insist, were one big overreaction to a contagious but not virulent disease. History tells us sick presidential candidates often win the ensuing election – Ronald Reagan nearly died from an assassin’s bullet in 1981 but won big in 1984 – or that their party will. When Warren G. Harding died in office (in 1923), his Republican party stayed in the White House for another ten years. Indeed, assassinated presidents tend to guarantee their party retains the White House at the next election: Lincoln’s murder in 1865 was a cause of his great general, Ulysses S. Grant, winning in 1868. William McKinley’s murder in 1903 put his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, into office for eight years. John Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 lead to Lyndon Johnson winning in a landslide the next year. Dying is, of course, not Trump’s plan, but sickness and death need not mean the GOP lose the White House. The greatest president in US history, measured by victories (1932, 1936, 1940 and 1944), Franklin Roosevelt, was also the most challenged by his health. A victim of polio, he spent his entire presidency in a wheelchair. The point is not that COVID could turn Trump into FDR. It is to observe how far illness can empower a president. Trump’s illness could have a positive effect on the tone of political discourse. Biden will not want to be seen to demonise a sick opponent. The presidential debates will almost certainly be cancelled – which will likely mean a more civil national debate. Again, we can only begin to properly estimate the political ramifications of Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis when we know his prognosis. It is another element of uncertainty in this strangest and most uncertain of election years. Coronavirus Donald Trump 2020 US elections COVID-19 Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden took part in a presidential debate Sept. 29 that exemplified the lack of civility in American politics. The president frequently interrupted and spoke over his challenger, Biden told Trump to “shut up,” and few issues were discussed in enough depth to provide much information to undecided voters. We asked three scholars to discuss themes brought up by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News, who struggled throughout the debate to keep control. The Supreme Court Alison Gash, University of Oregon Wallace opened with a question on the minds of many voters: Who should fill the vacancy left by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death? Democrats viewed Ginsburg as the last line of defense for abortion rights, voting rights, the Affordable Care Act and other traditionally liberal policies. Trump has nominated conservative jurist and scholar Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg’s seat on the bench. Trump has already exerted a significant influence over the federal bench. He has appointed more federal appellate judges than any president since Carter. If Barrett is appointed, he will have filled more Supreme Court vacancies than any president since Ronald Reagan and will have shaped the court in ways that could last generations. Biden all but conceded the appointment as a lost cause, pivoting to one of the few areas where a Biden win could conceivably limit the conservative influence of the Roberts Court — by stalling potential litigation over the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has publicly and actively supported litigation to overturn the ACA. Judge Barrett, Biden reminded viewers, believes the ACA is unconstitutional. Even with Ginsburg on the bench, the ACA enjoyed only fragile court support. Biden intimated that continued litigation in an even more conservative Supreme Court could limit health care coverage for millions of Americans. Biden mentioned Roe v. Wade — and Barrett’s likely opposition — only as an afterthought. In response, Trump stated cryptically, “There’s nothing happening there. And you don’t know her view on Roe v. Wade.” On the whole, the debate did little to resolve questions about the future of the court — other than to shore up Supreme Court nominations as political bombs with volatile consequences. Racism, Policing and Black Lives Matter Protests Rashawn Ray, University of Maryland “Why should voters trust you … to deal with the race issue facing this country?” Wallace asked a straightforward question about the troubling state of race relations in America, but the two candidates answered it in very different ways. Biden highlighted the “systemic injustice in this country, in education, in work, and in law enforcement” that required an approach grounded in equity, equality, decency and the Constitution. Trump pivoted quickly to “law and order” and brought up the Biden co-sponsored 1994 Crime Bill – legislation that has long been criticized for contributing to the disproportionate mass incarceration of Black Americans. But recent Trump advertisements have tried to suggest that violence will increase under a Biden presidency – paradoxically showing images of unrest under the current Trump administration. Trump seemingly wanted to attack this “tough on crime” Biden of the 1990s while simultaneously portraying his rival as being in league with what the president would like voters to believe is an unruly and violent left. The reality is different. Despite over 90% of Black Lives Matter protests being nonviolent, much of the media’s focus has been on the less than 10% of demonstrations that have turned violent. This debate did nothing to dispel that false narrative. In fact, some of the violence of recent months has been committed by right-wing extremists. But when asked directly to condemn white supremacy, Trump hesitated and seemed to be searching for words. Instead, he sent a shoutout to the Proud Boys – a group deemed to be a hate organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Trump said, “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left.” “He’s the racist,” said Biden during their exchanges. Meanwhile, on policing policy, Biden proposed a 21st-century redo to bring various stakeholders to the table. But eerily for Republicans and Democrats – and not at all in keeping with the debate itself – Trump and Biden seem to espouse similar views about the defunding police movement. “I am totally opposed to defunding the police. They need more assistance,” said Biden during the debate. Earlier Trump had stated, “There won’t be dismantling of our police, and there’s not going to be any disbanding of our police.” The integrity of the election Alexander Cohen, Clarkson University When asked about the integrity of mail-in ballots, Biden and Trump offered different answers. Biden projected faith in the mail-in system. Unsurprisingly, Trump continued to assault the integrity of an election using mail-in ballots. This echoes his mantra in 2016, when he argued that the popular vote count was incorrect and fraudulent – a notion that was widely debunked. Likewise, the assertion that mail-in voting leads to voter fraud has been widely challenged. Most studies suggest that voting by mail does not benefit one party over the other and that voting by mail is not prone to manipulation. However, such studies on voting by mail tend to examine scenarios where state and local governments were well prepared for ballot distribution. The increased demand for mail-in voting brought on by COVID-19 is creating at least some confusion among voters. It is plausible that not all states are ready to handle the flood of mail-in votes. This could complicate the voting process and prolong vote counts in some states. Such delays could be incredibly significant. The last time a key state struggled to tally votes was 2000. Then, the Supreme Court intervened to halt a recount in Florida, handing the victory to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore in a close presidential race. If disputes over mail-in ballots linger beyond Election Day, the Supreme Court may again intervene. If President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is quickly confirmed, conservatives will enjoy a 6-3 majority on the Court. Three of these justices will have been appointed by Trump. Trump has laid the groundwork for disputing the results of any close election. If neither candidate wins decisively, the nation should brace itself for a lengthy, and divisive, struggle. Such a struggle could be dangerous to American democracy because it may undermine fundamental faith in the electoral process. While rule of law generally prevails when close elections are disputed, it does appear that the United States could be headed toward uncharted territory. What question were you hoping to hear tonight that was left out in the midst of this chaotic debate? Cohen: I would have liked to ask: “Do you think that there are consequences for the decreasing civility in American politics, as demonstrated in this debate?” Gash: I would like to have seen a question about the role of the court in preserving checks and balances. This is, what I think, Wallace was trying to get at in his question about court-packing. But the question fell flat. Ray: Black people are disproportionately more likely to experience police use of force, even when they are unarmed and not attacking. How do we reduce racial disparities in use of force – as with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor – and improve relations between Black communities and law enforcement?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger For about a month now, I’ve had the government’s official COVID Alert app installed on my phone. It is active and monitoring. Each week I get a notification telling me I haven’t had contact with anybody who tested positive for the coronavirus. That’s good news but it isn’t too surprising. First of all, I work from home and barely leave the house. But I do so occasionally to get a haircut and buy some groceries. Second, even if one of the people I have had contact with was infected, I would only find out if they either have the app installed or they enter their positive result into their app. Both of those steps lower the chances of the app doing its job. In its first month, there were only 2.2 million downloads and 90 infections. As we confront a second wave of COVID-19 infections, how do we change that? Challenges I work with many entrepreneurs through the Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Toronto and we know that getting people to download an app can be challenging. They have to know about it. They have to remember to download it. And they have to remember to set it up. Invariably, what we try to do is get people who like an app to tell others to use the app too. These social referrals sometimes work on their own and in other cases, incentives are given such as a discount on services sold through the app. Ironically, to encourage people to download the COVID Alert app, we want to use viral processes as we’re attempting to contain an actual virus. And, yes, that’s a challenge because many of these app downloads are driven by people sharing thoughts when they are together — and most of us are living in relative isolation at the moment. It’s difficult to show someone an effective app when there are few people in your bubble. (Piqsels) To get the COVID Alert app installed, therefore, we need a push. Apple and Google are taking small steps in this direction. They will both have updates to smartphone operating systems that will allow people to be alerted to exposures without having an app installed. But they will still need an official app if they want to report a COVID-19 infection. Spurring the app to go viral The fact that private companies are working on this is good news. The COVID Alert app was built off an open-source base provided by Shopify that anticipated the need well ahead of the government. Now we need those very same companies to step in to get the app to go viral. They have levers to do this. Imagine a company with rewards points — like credit cards, airlines and supermarkets — offering bonus points for anyone installing the app. This might require some software but it could also be done at points of sale or upon delivery of your meals, with humans verifying an app install. Or maybe Apple or Google could offer incentives right in their app stores. There may be some privacy hurdles to overcome, but companies aren’t generally shy about trying to sell us stuff. Read more: To change coronavirus behaviours, think like a marketer We could go further by making clear that installing the app is a socially valuable act and, like wearing a mask, better for other people than it is for us. Can we ensure people personally benefit after installing the app? One possibility might be to anticipate a situation where things might go the other way, as some have suggested for convalescent plasma donations. In that case, to encourage people who had already had COVID-19 to donate their blood for use to help others fight the virus, economists suggested that they be given a voucher for their own family or friends to move to the front of the line for a treatment. A recovered COVID-19 patient donates blood in Panama City in May 2020. The blood product donated from recovered COVID-19 patients, known as convalescent plasma, may have antibodies that can help those critically ill from the virus. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco) If we should ever have a COVID-19 vaccine, it could take months to distribute. Those most in need will likely get it first, but the majority of us will have to wait. What if people could jump ahead in the queue based on how many months they’ve been using the app? In other words, we can make app installs a means of “paying it forward” and the return is that we can get vaccinated earlier. Infections must be entered into the app If we can push app downloads to a majority of the population, that will make a difference. Nonetheless, we’ll also need to worry about entering COVID-19 infections into the app as well. In South Korea, where they’ve done so well containing the virus, these infections are automatically entered when someone tests positive. A family wearing face masks to help protect against the spread of the coronavirus enjoy themselves at a park in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) Canada’s privacy laws don’t allow that. But we can do better. For instance, we could at least have the option for something other than self-reporting. If a test is positive, the person involved can be asked to enter the result right then and there. Alternatively, there might be a way of pushing that result to their app with their permission. Finding out you’re COVID-19 positive isn’t likely to be a great moment, and we can hardly expect people’s first thought to be to report their diagnosis to the app. But if we use nudges and other pushes, we can overcome some of the friction. As school begins, this is even more critical. The sooner we know about exposures, the sooner we can take action and keep things from getting out of hand. Schoolkids need to have the app installed on their phones right now, and they need to be allowed to carry those phones around all day. Before snapping those back-to-school photos and posting them to Facebook, parents should first ensure their children have the app installed. As we head into a second wave, the rest of us should install it immediately too. Technology Coronavirus Social isolation COVID-19 Contact tracing COVID-19 app Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have faced acute shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), medicines and other essential medical supplies, severely compounding the health crisis. Such shortages remain an acute and pressing problem, and are expected to worsen during a second wave. Many countries have responded to shortages by imposing export restrictions in an effort to bolster their own domestic supplies. But even though governments should seek to protect their populations, the use of export restrictions is damaging to global health systems — and ultimately undermines efforts to combat the coronavirus. At the onset of the pandemic, nearly 100 countries enacted temporary restrictions or bans on the export of medical products. Germany and France, for example, placed export restrictions on medical equipment and drugs, which were followed by an European Union-wide ban on medical equipment exports to non-EU countries. India — the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturer — restricted the export of dozens of drugs, including acetaminophen and various antibiotics. The United States halted the sale of masks and other medical gear to foreign buyers. A range of other countries followed suit, imposing various forms of restrictions, ranging from outright export prohibitions to cumbersome licensing requirements to discourage exports. Restrictions could escalate in second wave While some export restrictions have since been removed, many remain in place. And with a second wave looming, there is a risk that the use of such restrictions will escalate once again. Export restrictions hurt the countries that implement them, as well as their trading partners, by preventing deliveries of medical supplies and medicines, which can seriously disrupt health planning. People wait to be tested for COVID-19 at a clinic in Montréal in September 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Export restrictions can temporarily lower domestic prices and raise availability, giving the illusion of efficacy, but they discourage investments to increase production capacity, so any benefit is short-lived. Countries that impose export restrictions are also likely to fuel retaliation or emulation by other nations, cutting off their own access to medical products and components. Export restrictions therefore reduce the domestic availability of medical supplies, while also promoting panic-buying, hoarding and speculation. Read more: Coronavirus hoarding: Why you can stop amassing toilet paper The World Trade Organization (WTO) is supposed to prevent governments from arbitrarily imposing barriers to the flow of goods across borders. But during the COVID-19 crisis, its rules have failed to stop countries from imposing export restrictions. Existing WTO rules give considerable scope to governments to respond to emergencies, including permitting trade measures to protect human health, and allowing temporary export restrictions to prevent or relieve shortages of essential products. Full self-sufficiency impossible Some have suggested that the answer to supply shortages is to reshore production, so that each country produces its own medical supplies. But that’s neither realistic nor desirable. Medical supply chains are global in nature and, given the complexity of the products involved, it would be impossible for any one country to be fully self-sufficient. To take just one example, ventilators require as many as 1,000 parts, coming from dozens of countries and nine layers of suppliers. Trade in medical supplies and the components required to produce them is, therefore, essential. A patient is attached to a ventilator in the COVID-19 intensive care unit at St. Paul’s hospital in downtown Vancouver in April 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Four recommendations We propose four policy directions to address the trade-related aspects of the crisis: Governments must strengthen their commitment to prevent export restrictions in critical medical supplies. A group of nine countries, led by New Zealand and Singapore, has launched a multi-country pact to keep supply chains open and remove trade restrictions on essential goods. This initiative should be expanded through a WTO agreement to refrain from introducing measures that restrict trade in medical supplies. Governments should pursue diversification, rather than domestication, of medical supply chains. Countries are most vulnerable to serious shortages when they rely heavily on just a handful of suppliers for critical goods, regardless of whether those suppliers are domestic or foreign. Diversification is therefore the best way to reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions. Rather than competing with one another for scarce medical goods, states should be collaborating to address the underlying problem. Amid a global pandemic, beggar-thy-neighbour (or sicken-thy-neighbour) trade policies intended to bolster a country’s own medical supplies at the expense of others are counter-productive. Instead, the most effective means to address the supply shortage is through international co-operation to boost production, diversify medical supply chains and ensure supplies can move to where they are needed the most. Governments must significantly increase their investment in stockpiling reserves of essential medical supplies. Many countries maintain such stockpiles — containing everything from masks and gowns to ventilators — but chronic under-funding left them dangerously unprepared for the current crisis. When the pandemic hit, countries rapidly depleted their limited stocks. The resulting supply shortage was caused not by dependence on trade, but a failure in planning. Export restrictions are damaging both to the countries that implement them as well as their trading partners. As we stare down a second wave of COVID-19, there are far better alternatives to prevent shortages and ensure adequate supply of medical goods.

View all partners Languages Español English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger With just a month left until the November 3 US presidential election, contracting the virus could have politically positive or negative consequences for President Donald Trump. These will, of course, be contingent on how severe the president’s illness becomes. But we should not count him out and Biden in just yet. Here are the ways the diagnosis could swing the election either way for Trump. Negative Trump’s days in isolation will halt his intense campaign schedule. Trump was much better at energising crowds in airport hangers than Joe Biden has been. This advantage is now gone. Trump is a sick man. Campaigning in any form requires robust health. Any physical advantage born of being the younger and fitter of the two candidates has now gone. Because he has often disparaged the virulence of the disease, the president faces the public humiliation of being its victim. Trump does not deal well with humiliation – the excoriating account of his childhood, as told by his estranged niece, Mary L. Trump, is replete with examples of the young Donald dishing out but being unable to take humiliation. Trump has traded on his strong man image for decades. If he gets a bad dose, he will look every bit and more of his 74 years. If his experience is like that of Boris Johnson, Trump could well be out of action for weeks with the attendant psychological challenge of recovery weighing on him. The British PM, several intimates have observed, is still in recovery, still cognitively and emotionally impaired by his personal fight with COVID-19. Trump thrives on rallies but won’t be able to attend them for at least a couple of weeks. AAP/AP/ Jack Rendulich Positive There are also potential political advantages in Trump’s COVID diagnosis. Because of the virus, Joe Biden was already cautious about face-to-face campaigning. His younger opponent falling ill may well keep Biden more basement-bound and less willing to crisscross the battleground states. Trump is not the first leader to catch the virus. While Boris Johnson became very sick, Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, had a relatively mild dose. He was able to claim from personal experience how few people who catch the virus are actually killed by it. This has been Trump’s basic refrain over the course of the pandemic. Catching and recovering from the virus will prove he was right all along. Lockdowns, he will insist, were one big overreaction to a contagious but not virulent disease. History tells us sick presidential candidates often win the ensuing election – Ronald Reagan nearly died from an assassin’s bullet in 1981 but won big in 1984 – or that their party will. When Warren G. Harding died in office (in 1923), his Republican party stayed in the White House for another ten years. Indeed, assassinated presidents tend to guarantee their party retains the White House at the next election: Lincoln’s murder in 1865 was a cause of his great general, Ulysses S. Grant, winning in 1868. William McKinley’s murder in 1901 put his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, into office for eight years. John Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 lead to Lyndon Johnson winning in a landslide the next year. Dying is, of course, not Trump’s plan, but sickness and death need not mean the GOP lose the White House. The greatest president in US history, measured by victories (1932, 1936, 1940 and 1944), Franklin Roosevelt, was also the most challenged by his health. A victim of polio, he spent his entire presidency in a wheelchair. The point is not that COVID could turn Trump into FDR. It is to observe how far illness can empower a president. Trump’s illness could have a positive effect on the tone of political discourse. Biden will not want to be seen to demonise a sick opponent. The presidential debates will almost certainly be cancelled – which will likely mean a more civil national debate. Again, we can only begin to properly estimate the political ramifications of Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis when we know his prognosis. It is another element of uncertainty in this strangest and most uncertain of election years. This article originally stated William McKinley was assassinated in 1903. In fact, it was 1901.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden took part in a presidential debate Sept. 29 that exemplified the lack of civility in American politics. The president frequently interrupted and spoke over his challenger, Biden told Trump to “shut up,” and few issues were discussed in enough depth to provide much information to undecided voters. We asked three scholars to discuss themes brought up by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News, who struggled throughout the debate to keep control. The Supreme Court Alison Gash, University of Oregon Wallace opened with a question on the minds of many voters: Who should fill the vacancy left by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death? Democrats viewed Ginsburg as the last line of defense for abortion rights, voting rights, the Affordable Care Act and other traditionally liberal policies. Trump has nominated conservative jurist and scholar Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg’s seat on the bench. Trump has already exerted a significant influence over the federal bench. He has appointed more federal appellate judges than any president since Carter. If Barrett is appointed, he will have filled more Supreme Court vacancies than any president since Ronald Reagan and will have shaped the court in ways that could last generations. Biden all but conceded the appointment as a lost cause, pivoting to one of the few areas where a Biden win could conceivably limit the conservative influence of the Roberts Court — by stalling potential litigation over the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has publicly and actively supported litigation to overturn the ACA. Judge Barrett, Biden reminded viewers, believes the ACA is unconstitutional. Even with Ginsburg on the bench, the ACA enjoyed only fragile court support. Biden intimated that continued litigation in an even more conservative Supreme Court could limit health care coverage for millions of Americans. Biden mentioned Roe v. Wade — and Barrett’s likely opposition — only as an afterthought. In response, Trump stated cryptically, “There’s nothing happening there. And you don’t know her view on Roe v. Wade.” On the whole, the debate did little to resolve questions about the future of the court — other than to shore up Supreme Court nominations as political bombs with volatile consequences. Racism, Policing and Black Lives Matter Protests Rashawn Ray, University of Maryland “Why should voters trust you … to deal with the race issue facing this country?” Wallace asked a straightforward question about the troubling state of race relations in America, but the two candidates answered it in very different ways. Biden highlighted the “systemic injustice in this country, in education, in work, and in law enforcement” that required an approach grounded in equity, equality, decency and the Constitution. Trump pivoted quickly to “law and order” and brought up the Biden co-sponsored 1994 Crime Bill – legislation that has long been criticized for contributing to the disproportionate mass incarceration of Black Americans. But recent Trump advertisements have tried to suggest that violence will increase under a Biden presidency – paradoxically showing images of unrest under the current Trump administration. Trump seemingly wanted to attack this “tough on crime” Biden of the 1990s while simultaneously portraying his rival as being in league with what the president would like voters to believe is an unruly and violent left. The reality is different. Despite over 90% of Black Lives Matter protests being nonviolent, much of the media’s focus has been on the less than 10% of demonstrations that have turned violent. This debate did nothing to dispel that false narrative. In fact, some of the violence of recent months has been committed by right-wing extremists. But when asked directly to condemn white supremacy, Trump hesitated and seemed to be searching for words. Instead, he sent a shoutout to the Proud Boys – a group deemed to be a hate organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Trump said, “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left.” “He’s the racist,” said Biden during their exchanges. Meanwhile, on policing policy, Biden proposed a 21st-century redo to bring various stakeholders to the table. But eerily for Republicans and Democrats – and not at all in keeping with the debate itself – Trump and Biden seem to espouse similar views about the defunding police movement. “I am totally opposed to defunding the police. They need more assistance,” said Biden during the debate. Earlier Trump had stated, “There won’t be dismantling of our police, and there’s not going to be any disbanding of our police.” The integrity of the election Alexander Cohen, Clarkson University When asked about the integrity of mail-in ballots, Biden and Trump offered different answers. Biden projected faith in the mail-in system. Unsurprisingly, Trump continued to assault the integrity of an election using mail-in ballots. This echoes his mantra in 2016, when he argued that the popular vote count was incorrect and fraudulent – a notion that was widely debunked. Likewise, the assertion that mail-in voting leads to voter fraud has been widely challenged. Most studies suggest that voting by mail does not benefit one party over the other and that voting by mail is not prone to manipulation. However, such studies on voting by mail tend to examine scenarios where state and local governments were well prepared for ballot distribution. The increased demand for mail-in voting brought on by COVID-19 is creating at least some confusion among voters. It is plausible that not all states are ready to handle the flood of mail-in votes. This could complicate the voting process and prolong vote counts in some states. Such delays could be incredibly significant. The last time a key state struggled to tally votes was 2000. Then, the Supreme Court intervened to halt a recount in Florida, handing the victory to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore in a close presidential race. If disputes over mail-in ballots linger beyond Election Day, the Supreme Court may again intervene. If President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is quickly confirmed, conservatives will enjoy a 6-3 majority on the Court. Three of these justices will have been appointed by Trump. Trump has laid the groundwork for disputing the results of any close election. If neither candidate wins decisively, the nation should brace itself for a lengthy, and divisive, struggle. Such a struggle could be dangerous to American democracy because it may undermine fundamental faith in the electoral process. While rule of law generally prevails when close elections are disputed, it does appear that the United States could be headed toward uncharted territory. What question were you hoping to hear tonight that was left out in the midst of this chaotic debate? Cohen: I would have liked to ask: “Do you think that there are consequences for the decreasing civility in American politics, as demonstrated in this debate?” Gash: I would like to have seen a question about the role of the court in preserving checks and balances. This is, what I think, Wallace was trying to get at in his question about court-packing. But the question fell flat. Ray: Black people are disproportionately more likely to experience police use of force, even when they are unarmed and not attacking. How do we reduce racial disparities in use of force – as with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor – and improve relations between Black communities and law enforcement?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Face masks reduce the spread of viruses passed on from respiratory secretions. While cloth masks are imperfect, widespread use of an imperfect mask has the potential to make a big difference in transmission of the virus. We started reading the research on cloth masks and face coverings at the start of the pandemic, looking for ways to protect our vulnerable dialysis patients and our dialysis staff. We found a total of 25 studies, advocated for mask use and summarized our findings in a peer-reviewed publication. We also created an evidence-based, plain-language website (www.clothmasks.ca) to help people navigate this area. Although mask use has been widely adopted, many people still have questions about them. I see spaces in the cloth. How can it stop particles? The virus that causes COVID-19 is about 0.1 micrometer in diameter. (A micrometer (µm) is one one-thousandth of a millimeter.) The holes in woven cloth are visible to the naked eye and may be five to 200 micrometers in diameter. It is counter-intuitive that cloth can be useful in this setting — it’s been compared to putting up a chain-link fence to stop mosquitoes. However, that analogy is wrong in many ways. According to aerosol science, whenever liquid hangs in air it is technically an aerosol, but other disciplines use the word “droplet” to mean a coarse particle five micrometers or larger, and reserve “aerosol” for fine particles smaller than five micrometers in effective diameter. When we breathe, talk, eat, cough, sneeze or sing, we emit particles across a range of sizes, both coarse and fine, and the virus is in those particles. Even though there are gaps between the threads in cloth, the threads are usually wider than the gaps. Also, at this microscopic level, the thread has thickness, or depth, so the gap is more a tunnel than a window. Microfilaments from broken or irregular threads project into the gap. The particle is not like a mosquito, which can redirect itself to avoid obstacles. A particle with momentum will run into a fibre, even though the air stream is diverted around it, like a ball hitting a wall — this is called impaction. Québec Premier François Legault puts on a Montréal Canadiens face mask as he finishes the daily COVID-19 press briefing on May 21, 2020 in Montréal. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz But at the microscopic level, there are two additional processes in play. Particles also fall out of the air — called sedimentation. Some particles are moving randomly and this random motion brings them into contact with fibres — called diffusion. Finally, cloth can be used in multiple layers, adding a second and third gauntlet for the particle to run before it reaches the other side. The point is not that some particles may penetrate the cloth, but that some are blocked. What are the best materials for cloth face masks? Based on our summary of 25 different studies, woven cotton, at least 100 threads per inch; flannel, either cotton or poly-cotton blend, at least 90 threads per inch; tea towel material; and heavy, good quality, cotton T-shirt material all performed well. This recommendation is based on the published data available, which doesn’t cover all possible mask materials: we didn’t find a lot of information on synthetic materials, for example, so we don’t know how they compare. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is smaller than the spaces between the threads of many types of cloth, wearing a cloth mask is not like trying to contain a mosquito with a chain-link fence. (Pixabay) Every study that looked at layering found that it made a difference, so we recommend that masks be made of at least two layers; three or four may be even better. We found evidence for multiple layers of the same fabrics and for sandwiches of different materials. We did not find good evidence of useful levels of filtration for disposable filters, like coffee filters, so we suggest not using them. For example, a two-layer T-shirt mask with a sewn edge — which prevents stretching — prevented 79 per cent of mouth bacteria reaching the environment during coughing. In the same experiment, a modern disposable medical mask performed in the same range at 85 per cent. Two studies of surgical masks from the 1960s and 1970s distinguished between coarse particles (sometimes called droplets) and fine particles (sometimes called aerosols). A four-layer cotton mask and a mask made of a sandwich of cotton and flannel both reduced mouth bacteria in particles of all sizes reaching the environment during talking by 99 per cent and mouth bacteria in fine particles by 89 per cent. This is all good evidence that cloth face coverings can prevent respiratory secretions from reaching the environment. Every coarse or fine particle trapped in a mask is not available to hang in the air or fall to a surface and contaminate it. “My mask protects you, your mask protects me”: if many people wear face coverings we expect the probability of transmission to fall. Can a cloth mask protect the person wearing it? We found four studies of inward filtration, all of which showed useful levels of filtration, all using the same widely-accepted technology that measures salt particles in the fine particle (0.02 to 1.0 micrometer) range. A study of one-layer tea-towel masks and a study of two-layer masks made of T-shirt material both showed at least 50 per cent protection for fine particles. Two cloth masks of unknown materials randomly purchased from street vendors performed just as well. For comparison, two of these studies — using exactly the same methods — examined how well modern disposable medical masks worked when tested on volunteers: they filtered around 80 per cent of fine particles. Three researchers from the University of Pittsburgh made complex masks with eight layers of pre-shrunk high-quality cotton T-shirts fitted to their own faces: each filtered more than 90 per cent of inward aerosol-sized fine particles, offering proof-of-concept for the idea of designing better cloth masks. Many of the cloth masks in current use are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them. (Pixabay) An animal experiment with tuberculosis bacteria provides further insight. Tuberculosis is usually considered an “airborne” disease, that is, one with an important transmission route through aerosols or fine particles. When caring for tuberculosis patients, health-care workers wear N95 masks, a high level of respiratory protection, to protect themselves and prevent onward transmission to others. When rabbits were exposed to aerosols of tuberculosis in controlled conditions, tuberculomas (infected abscesses) were reduced by 95 per cent in rabbits that wore close-fitting three- to six-layer gauze masks compared with those that did not. Many of the cloth masks in current use, therefore, are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them, and we have proof-of-concept for improved cloth mask materials and design. At what rate of use do masks become beneficial? Two modelling studies predict that 50 per cent adoption of a 50 per cent effective mask will have an important effect on transmission, and that if either percentage is increased, transmission is further reduced. We need to work on making cloth masks more effective, but the masks that we have on hand have the potential to change the course of the pandemic, particularly if we almost all wear them. Mask mandates were imposed at different times in different states in the United States, creating a natural experiment. The COVID-19 daily growth rate fell by one per cent in the first five days and by two per cent at 21 days after a mask mandate was imposed. These effects are not small: they represent 16 to 19 per cent of the effects of other much more invasive measures (school closures, bans on large gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and closures of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues). Taken together, this suggests that cloth face coverings of the type currently available have the potential to reduce transmission, and that when cloth face coverings are mandated, the growth rate decreases. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle projected on Sept. 3 that an increase in mask usage from the current 60 per cent to 95 per cent, combined with enhanced local social distancing as needed, would reduce global deaths by three-quarters of a million people before the end of 2020. Are there any other benefits to wearing a mask? British Columbia provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry wears a face mask as she views the Murals of Gratitude exhibition in Vancouver, on July 3, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck A new hypothesis advanced by researchers at the University of California San Francisco suggests that cloth masks don’t just reduce the probability of infectious organisms reaching a person, but also the number of infectious organisms — and that a lower number of infecting organisms leads to less severe disease. Accumulating epidemiologic evidence from this pandemic suggests that when masks are worn, the overall severity of illness is lower. The proportion of those infected who remain asymptomatic is higher, and the probability of dying is lower. In animal experiments it is well known that the inoculum (the infecting dose) is related to disease severity. The threshold at which 50 per cent of animals in a group receiving the same dose die of infection is called the lethal-dose 50 (LD50). Experiments on mice using the coronaviruses MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, showed dose-response and in MERS-CoV established LD50. In hamsters separated by surgical masks between cages from hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the severity of infection was reduced compared with hamsters unprotected by masks. Further research on better cloth masks will be helpful. At the Centre of Excellence for Protective Equipment and Materials at McMaster, we hope to play a role in that work. However, even imperfect uptake and imperfect use of imperfect masks has the potential to have a surprisingly large impact during this pandemic. We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have faced acute shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), medicines and other essential medical supplies, severely compounding the health crisis. Such shortages remain an acute and pressing problem, and are expected to worsen during a second wave. Many countries have responded to shortages by imposing export restrictions in an effort to bolster their own domestic supplies. But even though governments should seek to protect their populations, the use of export restrictions is damaging to global health systems — and ultimately undermines efforts to combat the coronavirus. At the onset of the pandemic, nearly 100 countries enacted temporary restrictions or bans on the export of medical products. Germany and France, for example, placed export restrictions on medical equipment and drugs, which were followed by an European Union-wide ban on medical equipment exports to non-EU countries. India — the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturer — restricted the export of dozens of drugs, including acetaminophen and various antibiotics. The United States halted the sale of masks and other medical gear to foreign buyers. A range of other countries followed suit, imposing various forms of restrictions, ranging from outright export prohibitions to cumbersome licensing requirements to discourage exports. Restrictions could escalate in second wave While some export restrictions have since been removed, many remain in place. And with a second wave looming, there is a risk that the use of such restrictions will escalate once again. Export restrictions hurt the countries that implement them, as well as their trading partners, by preventing deliveries of medical supplies and medicines, which can seriously disrupt health planning. People wait to be tested for COVID-19 at a clinic in Montréal in September 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Export restrictions can temporarily lower domestic prices and raise availability, giving the illusion of efficacy, but they discourage investments to increase production capacity, so any benefit is short-lived. Countries that impose export restrictions are also likely to fuel retaliation or emulation by other nations, cutting off their own access to medical products and components. Export restrictions therefore reduce the domestic availability of medical supplies, while also promoting panic-buying, hoarding and speculation. Read more: Coronavirus hoarding: Why you can stop amassing toilet paper The World Trade Organization (WTO) is supposed to prevent governments from arbitrarily imposing barriers to the flow of goods across borders. But during the COVID-19 crisis, its rules have failed to stop countries from imposing export restrictions. Existing WTO rules give considerable scope to governments to respond to emergencies, including permitting trade measures to protect human health, and allowing temporary export restrictions to prevent or relieve shortages of essential products. Full self-sufficiency impossible Some have suggested that the answer to supply shortages is to reshore production, so that each country produces its own medical supplies. But that’s neither realistic nor desirable. Medical supply chains are global in nature and, given the complexity of the products involved, it would be impossible for any one country to be fully self-sufficient. To take just one example, ventilators require as many as 1,000 parts, coming from dozens of countries and nine layers of suppliers. Trade in medical supplies and the components required to produce them is, therefore, essential. A patient is attached to a ventilator in the COVID-19 intensive care unit at St. Paul’s hospital in downtown Vancouver in April 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Four recommendations We propose four policy directions to address the trade-related aspects of the crisis: Governments must strengthen their commitment to prevent export restrictions in critical medical supplies. A group of nine countries, led by New Zealand and Singapore, has launched a multi-country pact to keep supply chains open and remove trade restrictions on essential goods. This initiative should be expanded through a WTO agreement to refrain from introducing measures that restrict trade in medical supplies. Governments should pursue diversification, rather than domestication, of medical supply chains. Countries are most vulnerable to serious shortages when they rely heavily on just a handful of suppliers for critical goods, regardless of whether those suppliers are domestic or foreign. Diversification is therefore the best way to reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions. Rather than competing with one another for scarce medical goods, states should be collaborating to address the underlying problem. Amid a global pandemic, beggar-thy-neighbour (or sicken-thy-neighbour) trade policies intended to bolster a country’s own medical supplies at the expense of others are counter-productive. Instead, the most effective means to address the supply shortage is through international co-operation to boost production, diversify medical supply chains and ensure supplies can move to where they are needed the most. Governments must significantly increase their investment in stockpiling reserves of essential medical supplies. Many countries maintain such stockpiles — containing everything from masks and gowns to ventilators — but chronic under-funding left them dangerously unprepared for the current crisis. When the pandemic hit, countries rapidly depleted their limited stocks. The resulting supply shortage was caused not by dependence on trade, but a failure in planning. Export restrictions are damaging both to the countries that implement them as well as their trading partners. As we stare down a second wave of COVID-19, there are far better alternatives to prevent shortages and ensure adequate supply of medical goods.

Partners View all partners Candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump at the final presidential debate. AP/Julio Cortez Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden met on Oct. 22 for the final debate in the 2020 election and, like the first debate, it was unusual. COVID-19 forced social distancing and largely took the studio audience, with their laughter, cheering and booing out of the equation. What’s more, with norm-breaking interruptions and stealing of speaking time an inherent part of Donald Trump’s debate strategy, the contentious crosstalk between the two candidates and the moderator made long sections of the candidates’ first debate nearly impossible to hear or follow. The threat of having the microphone cut off effectively muted this aggression. But is what they say as important as we think? Although news coverage generally focuses on what the candidates say, as a political psychologist who studies nonverbal behavior, I focus less on the rehearsed answers and more on the space between talking points. These moments, when candidates nonverbally – and largely involuntarily – respond to their opposition can be enormously revealing. In other words, how people listen and react may speak louder than what they say. Biden Biden laughs off a Trump attack. C-SPAN During this debate Joe Biden reacted as the emotionally expressive politician he has been throughout his career. Even when directly dealing with attacks from Trump, whether aimed at his family or his record, Biden often smiled, laughed and shook his head while closing his eyes. That made him appear bemused, if not jovial. Research suggests that people in informal discussions often change topics within 30 seconds of laughter occurring. This, in turn may be why people – especially politicians - “laugh off” insults. Laughter when under attack likely signals that Biden feels positive enough to be playful and that he is subtly taking control of the conversation. Trump A signature Trump expression known as the ‘lip funneler.’ C-SPAN Trump presented a much less aggressive and more thoughtful face to the American public during this second debate, especially when compared to the first one. Instead of directly attacking Biden when his assertions were questioned, Trump responded with what may best be termed a controlled-posed smile, in which his lower lip is pressed up while his lip corners were pulled up in a smile. This type of smile is often used to mask negative emotions or to signal positive emotions when they are not felt. Perhaps Trump’s signature facial display is his protruding funneled lips. This lip funneler – as it is referred to by facial display researchers – can often be seen while Trump is listening and preparing to interrupt or respond to Biden. The research that exists about this behavior in humans suggests it is a primal display often occurring during intense emotional situations and is associated with anger and threats while engaging in dominance-seeking behavior. Much can be learned about each candidate with the noise turned down and the attention placed squarely on their distinct nonverbal behavior styles. This is especially the case when focusing on how the candidates respond to their opposition’s assertions and attacks. Public figures can often control how they act. However, they often do not have as much control over how they react in the heat of the moment. [Expertise in your inbox.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger This past summer, many students were not able to fill the suggested 700 farming jobs funded by the federal government due to geographical or transportation barriers, limited positions or career irrelevance. At the same time, there was a larger demand for food grown locally in response to initial concerns about international imports during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. News stories from earlier this year covered farm problems such as milk dumping, produce dumping, an anticipated rise in meat prices and concern about a lack of agricultural production to feed the country. Read more: 100 days of coronavirus has sent shock waves through the food system Since March, farmers have continued selling at farmers markets, have sold out of community-supported agriculture (CSA) shares and responded to an increased demand as more people have taken up homesteading activities such as home cooking, gardening and canning. This turn to local food, a more plant-based diet and home-based food production has been recommended by health professionals, climate scientists and community resilience builders alike. As graduate and medical student researchers, we see that the potential silver lining of COVID-19 health measures may be the fostering of a healthier lifestyle and building community resilience. A pile of fresh garlic in bunches ready for pickup and market delivery. Ontario garlic prices have risen this summer as a response to rising demand in local foods and fears that imports will be affected. (Kimberly Hill-Tout), Author provided Health benefits The most recent version of Canada’s Food Guide was released in March 2020. There was a stark contrast — the new guide was a move away from its lobbyist-informed predecessor. It recommended daily foods comprising half vegetables and fruit, and in the protein section there was reference to alternative protein sources such as beans, nuts, legumes and tofu. Plant-based diets have for years now been the recommendation for maintaining a healthy body weight, reducing one’s risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. These diets can also lower cholesterol, slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, help with digestion by increasing fibre intake and reduce the risk of developing hypertension . Eating locally also means that there are fewer chances for food-borne contamination, and better contact tracing within local systems. For example, red onions imported from the United States were the cause of a salmonella outbreak in Canada, infecting 457 people. Community benefits Community resilience is the ability of a community to survive and recover from adverse situations and events. Essentially, the resources that a community has — like food — can be affected by an event, and then adapt and grow in a way that will be more effective to withstanding future adverse events. Social networks can be a crucial part of building community resiliency. The growing interest in local food as a reaction to COVID-19 can ultimately build social networks through farmer and non-farmer interactions as people seek out local farms and attend farmers markets. An additional factor that builds community resilience is the increased interest in home skills. During quarantine, there was a surge of people taking up home cooking both as a necessary action as well as for stress relief. People also took up baking, preserving foods, gardening and crafting. Read more: Before DIY sourdough starters became popular, there was home economics This skill building creates community resilience because people learn to manipulate their resources. Whether it be in the form of stress relief or becoming less dependent on outsourced labour, people “bounced forward,” developing and adapting new methods and skills to mitigate future adversities. Barriers to access There are also limitations to the surge of interest in local food and skill-based activities. Similar to the inaccessibility of organic foods to households without disposable income, the affordability of local foods and access to farmers markets during COVID-19 can be a challenge to individuals without transportation or financial means. An example is Knuckle Down Farm in Stirling, Ont. A small share costs $20 per week, while a large share costs $35 per week, which works out to be between $400 and $700 for a 20-week commitment. These need to be picked up weekly at the farm itself, which is inaccessible by transit. The price increases by $5 per week for delivery to the Toronto region, where it would still need to be picked up from an east-end address. Encouraging healthy diets during a pandemic The federal government needs to consider both larger social factors involved in overcoming adverse conditions and support communities that are in need of assistance. CERB financial relief can help cover a few monthly costs, but may not help everyone in taking up healthier diets or fostering community resilience. To increase access and participation in local food markets, governments need to subsidise local food and deter the dumping of agricultural goods. Community resilience can also be encouraged by offering courses in skills-based activities like food prep and preserving. COVID-19 has disrupted and changed the way we live our lives. Food can provide a means to encourage healthy diets, improve community relationships and address social inequalities as a way to enhance community resilience.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Face masks reduce the spread of viruses passed on from respiratory secretions. While cloth masks are imperfect, widespread use of an imperfect mask has the potential to make a big difference in transmission of the virus. We started reading the research on cloth masks and face coverings at the start of the pandemic, looking for ways to protect our vulnerable dialysis patients and our dialysis staff. We found a total of 25 studies, advocated for mask use and summarized our findings in a peer-reviewed publication. We also created an evidence-based, plain-language website (www.clothmasks.ca) to help people navigate this area. Although mask use has been widely adopted, many people still have questions about them. I see spaces in the cloth. How can it stop particles? The virus that causes COVID-19 is about 0.1 micrometer in diameter. (A micrometer (µm) is one one-thousandth of a millimeter.) The holes in woven cloth are visible to the naked eye and may be five to 200 micrometers in diameter. It is counter-intuitive that cloth can be useful in this setting — it’s been compared to putting up a chain-link fence to stop mosquitoes. However, that analogy is wrong in many ways. According to aerosol science, whenever liquid hangs in air it is technically an aerosol, but other disciplines use the word “droplet” to mean a coarse particle five micrometers or larger, and reserve “aerosol” for fine particles smaller than five micrometers in effective diameter. When we breathe, talk, eat, cough, sneeze or sing, we emit particles across a range of sizes, both coarse and fine, and the virus is in those particles. Even though there are gaps between the threads in cloth, the threads are usually wider than the gaps. Also, at this microscopic level, the thread has thickness, or depth, so the gap is more a tunnel than a window. Microfilaments from broken or irregular threads project into the gap. The particle is not like a mosquito, which can redirect itself to avoid obstacles. A particle with momentum will run into a fibre, even though the air stream is diverted around it, like a ball hitting a wall — this is called impaction. Québec Premier François Legault puts on a Montréal Canadiens face mask as he finishes the daily COVID-19 press briefing on May 21, 2020 in Montréal. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz But at the microscopic level, there are two additional processes in play. Particles also fall out of the air — called sedimentation. Some particles are moving randomly and this random motion brings them into contact with fibres — called diffusion. Finally, cloth can be used in multiple layers, adding a second and third gauntlet for the particle to run before it reaches the other side. The point is not that some particles may penetrate the cloth, but that some are blocked. What are the best materials for cloth face masks? Based on our summary of 25 different studies, woven cotton, at least 100 threads per inch; flannel, either cotton or poly-cotton blend, at least 90 threads per inch; tea towel material; and heavy, good quality, cotton T-shirt material all performed well. This recommendation is based on the published data available, which doesn’t cover all possible mask materials: we didn’t find a lot of information on synthetic materials, for example, so we don’t know how they compare. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is smaller than the spaces between the threads of many types of cloth, wearing a cloth mask is not like trying to contain a mosquito with a chain-link fence. (Pixabay) Every study that looked at layering found that it made a difference, so we recommend that masks be made of at least two layers; three or four may be even better. We found evidence for multiple layers of the same fabrics and for sandwiches of different materials. We did not find good evidence of useful levels of filtration for disposable filters, like coffee filters, so we suggest not using them. For example, a two-layer T-shirt mask with a sewn edge — which prevents stretching — prevented 79 per cent of mouth bacteria reaching the environment during coughing. In the same experiment, a modern disposable medical mask performed in the same range at 85 per cent. Two studies of surgical masks from the 1960s and 1970s distinguished between coarse particles (sometimes called droplets) and fine particles (sometimes called aerosols). A four-layer cotton mask and a mask made of a sandwich of cotton and flannel both reduced mouth bacteria in particles of all sizes reaching the environment during talking by 99 per cent and mouth bacteria in fine particles by 89 per cent. This is all good evidence that cloth face coverings can prevent respiratory secretions from reaching the environment. Every coarse or fine particle trapped in a mask is not available to hang in the air or fall to a surface and contaminate it. “My mask protects you, your mask protects me”: if many people wear face coverings we expect the probability of transmission to fall. Can a cloth mask protect the person wearing it? We found four studies of inward filtration, all of which showed useful levels of filtration, all using the same widely-accepted technology that measures salt particles in the fine particle (0.02 to 1.0 micrometer) range. A study of one-layer tea-towel masks and a study of two-layer masks made of T-shirt material both showed at least 50 per cent protection for fine particles. Two cloth masks of unknown materials randomly purchased from street vendors performed just as well. For comparison, two of these studies — using exactly the same methods — examined how well modern disposable medical masks worked when tested on volunteers: they filtered around 80 per cent of fine particles. Three researchers from the University of Pittsburgh made complex masks with eight layers of pre-shrunk high-quality cotton T-shirts fitted to their own faces: each filtered more than 90 per cent of inward aerosol-sized fine particles, offering proof-of-concept for the idea of designing better cloth masks. Many of the cloth masks in current use are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them. (Pixabay) An animal experiment with tuberculosis bacteria provides further insight. Tuberculosis is usually considered an “airborne” disease, that is, one with an important transmission route through aerosols or fine particles. When caring for tuberculosis patients, health-care workers wear N95 masks, a high level of respiratory protection, to protect themselves and prevent onward transmission to others. When rabbits were exposed to aerosols of tuberculosis in controlled conditions, tuberculomas (infected abscesses) were reduced by 95 per cent in rabbits that wore close-fitting three- to six-layer gauze masks compared with those that did not. Many of the cloth masks in current use, therefore, are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them, and we have proof-of-concept for improved cloth mask materials and design. At what rate of use do masks become beneficial? Two modelling studies predict that 50 per cent adoption of a 50 per cent effective mask will have an important effect on transmission, and that if either percentage is increased, transmission is further reduced. We need to work on making cloth masks more effective, but the masks that we have on hand have the potential to change the course of the pandemic, particularly if we almost all wear them. Mask mandates were imposed at different times in different states in the United States, creating a natural experiment. The COVID-19 daily growth rate fell by one per cent in the first five days and by two per cent at 21 days after a mask mandate was imposed. These effects are not small: they represent 16 to 19 per cent of the effects of other much more invasive measures (school closures, bans on large gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and closures of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues). Taken together, this suggests that cloth face coverings of the type currently available have the potential to reduce transmission, and that when cloth face coverings are mandated, the growth rate decreases. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle projected on Sept. 3 that an increase in mask usage from the current 60 per cent to 95 per cent, combined with enhanced local social distancing as needed, would reduce global deaths by three-quarters of a million people before the end of 2020. Are there any other benefits to wearing a mask? British Columbia provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry wears a face mask as she views the Murals of Gratitude exhibition in Vancouver, on July 3, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck A new hypothesis advanced by researchers at the University of California San Francisco suggests that cloth masks don’t just reduce the probability of infectious organisms reaching a person, but also the number of infectious organisms — and that a lower number of infecting organisms leads to less severe disease. Accumulating epidemiologic evidence from this pandemic suggests that when masks are worn, the overall severity of illness is lower. The proportion of those infected who remain asymptomatic is higher, and the probability of dying is lower. In animal experiments it is well known that the inoculum (the infecting dose) is related to disease severity. The threshold at which 50 per cent of animals in a group receiving the same dose die of infection is called the lethal-dose 50 (LD50). Experiments on mice using the coronaviruses MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, showed dose-response and in MERS-CoV established LD50. In hamsters separated by surgical masks between cages from hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the severity of infection was reduced compared with hamsters unprotected by masks. Further research on better cloth masks will be helpful. At the Centre of Excellence for Protective Equipment and Materials at McMaster, we hope to play a role in that work. However, even imperfect uptake and imperfect use of imperfect masks has the potential to have a surprisingly large impact during this pandemic. We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In addition to its staggering impact on physical well-being and mortality, COVID-19 is also taking an unprecedented toll on our mental health. Numerous recent studies have shown global increases in the prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety as well as increases in post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. These increases likely stem from the changes to daily life we have all been asked to make in attempts to mitigate viral spread. Yet conventional mental health approaches and diagnoses do not fully capture the nuanced mental health impacts of this pandemic. These approaches may not be sufficient to guide the development of strategies to address the pandemic’s rapidly increasing mental health burden. As clinical psychologists with expertise in fear and anxiety-related conditions as well as assessment and treatment development, our team was interested in trying to fully understand the specific mental health effects of this pandemic in order to inform the development of effective public health messaging and evidence-based interventions. Supported by funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the University of Regina, we conducted a longitudinal population-based survey of a large sample of Canadian and American respondents, with surveys administered in late March, mid-May and early July of 2020. Based on this data we determined that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is best understood as a multi-faceted syndrome comprising a network of interconnected symptoms. COVID Stress Scales Using data from approximately 7,000 respondents collected in late March, we developed, validated and published our COVID Stress Scales. These scales assess five core features of COVID-19-related stress: fear of danger and contamination, fear of adverse socio-economic consequences, checking and reassurance seeking, xenophobia (discrimination against foreigners) and traumatic stress symptoms (for example, pandemic-related nightmares). Since the five scales were intercorrelated, they can also be added together to provide an overall indication of pandemic-related stress levels. The COVID Stress Scales, now translated into 12 languages, offer widespread promise as a tool for better understanding the distress associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services. An online self-assessment that provides people with a severity rating and self-help recommendations is now available. COVID stress syndrome The five COVID Stress Scales are intercorrelated; that is, the symptoms measured by each of the five scales tend to occur together. This observation provided initial evidence that the various symptoms of COVID-19-related distress may be facets of a syndrome. We further evaluated and confirmed this idea in a subsequent study. The COVID stress syndrome is anchored by COVID-19-related danger and contamination fears as its central feature, with strongest connections to fear of adverse socio-economic consequences and disease-related xenophobia (fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection). Fear of adverse socio-economic consequences was the second-most central feature, highlighting the importance of impacts of the pandemic on social and financial security. Traumatic stress symptoms were the third-most central feature and most strongly associated with danger and contamination fears and checking and reassurance seeking, suggesting a vicious cycle wherein these facets of the syndrome fuel each other. For example, more exposure to COVID-19 news or social media may lead to greater frequency of nightmares about COVID-19, which, in turn, increases fear of contamination and further fuels checking the news and social media for up-to-date information. Although less central, xenophobia affected fears of danger and contamination, socio-economic consequences and, to a lesser extent, checking and reassurance seeking, highlighting the impact of discriminatory beliefs on pandemic-related emotional responding. Substantial mental health footprint Our preliminary findings suggest the percentage of the population affected by COVID stress syndrome is substantial, with the mental health footprint of COVID-19 exceeding the medical footprint. Although two per cent of our sample reported having had COVID-19 and six per cent knew someone who had been infected, 38 per cent and 16 per cent respectively were classified as having moderate-to-severe or severe COVID-19-related distress. In short, more than 50 per cent of the population reported considerably elevated levels of distress specific to the pandemic. Higher scores were associated with things like panic buying, excessive avoidance of public places and unhelpful ways of coping (for example, overeating and overusing drugs and alcohol) during self‐isolation. In subsequent studies we have shown that elevated COVID stress is also associated with greater stigmatization of health-care workers and that the significant proportion of the population with pre-existing anxiety disorders experience more negative effects than those with depressive disorders or no mental health conditions. On a positive note, we have also observed that elevated COVID stress is associated with favourable attitudes towards vaccination, use of personal protective equipment and pandemic-related altruism. Looking forward Our research has identified what appears to be a network of interconnected symptoms, a COVID stress syndrome, with fear of the dangerousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the core, interconnecting to socio-economic concerns, xenophobia, traumatic stress symptoms and compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. The syndrome, in turn, is primarily associated with other negative mental health and socially disruptive consequences such as panic buying, excessive avoidance and unhelpful ways of coping during self‐isolation. We anticipate that as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, so too will the mental health challenges and needs of the public. Further research is needed to understand the full effects of COVID-related stress and whether these change as the pandemic progresses. Research is also needed to understand the disruptive impact of the antithesis of COVID-19 stress, that being a disregard for the seriousness of COVID-19 and its consequences. COVID-19 has generated a complex network of mental health reactions. The concept of the COVID stress syndrome can help build the nuanced understanding of those reactions necessary to develop targeted, evidence-based campaigns and interventions to reduce its psychological footprint. These developments are as critical to reducing the mental health toll of the pandemic as is the discovery of a vaccine to facilitating immunity.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As the second wave of COVID-19 has now officially hit Central Canada (Québec and Ontario), we can expect health-care system resources to again be disproportionally demanded by COVID-19 patients. Addressing the direct health implications of the pandemic is clearly necessary, but doing so may come at an indirect cost for non-COVID patients who may struggle to access needed care. Meeting those unmet health-care needs calls for policy actions such as better data, alignment of physicians’ billings with telemedicine, including extended hours, and ensuring all Canadians have a regular point of care. I am a health economist and health policy researcher, and in my work, I regularly analyze how the organization of health-care systems influence health care and health outcomes. In a recently published article, my co-author Ian Allan and I studied the evolution of unmet health-care needs in Canada since the early 2000s. We found a remarkable stability over a period of 14 years of the groups reporting comparatively more unmet health-care needs: women, those in poorer health and those without a regular doctor. Unmet needs Unmet health-care needs reflect an inadequacy between the needs perceived by people seeking health care (the patients, or those trying to become someone’s patient), and the actual health-care services received, making it a measure of lack of accessibility of care. While they tend to be self-reported, unmet health-care needs are a commonly used and a valid measure, since higher unmet health-care needs in the present predict poorer health in the future. And these unmet health-care needs are poised to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for women are wide-ranging, including the fact that industries hit hardest tend to employ more women, or that the lion’s share of household responsibilities during and after lockdown still fell on women. Unfortunately, women in Canada are also more likely than men to report unmet health-care needs. We also found that over time, there has been an increasing share of women reporting unmet needs due to system reasons. Excessive wait times and areas where care is not available are examples of systemic causes that could be addressed by health policy. People with chronic conditions who are not getting regular care during the pandemic are at risk of becoming more seriously ill. (Unsplash) Individuals in poorer health, like those with chronic conditions, face a double-edged sword with COVID-19. On one hand, they are more likely to develop severe forms of COVID-19 if they become infected. This gives them incentive to limit social exposure, including contacts with health-care providers and clinic environments. On the other hand, these individuals are likely to become more seriously ill if their conditions are not properly managed and monitored, which requires contacts with the health-care system. Again, individuals in poorer health report consistently higher unmet health-care needs than their healthier counterparts, which means they are more at risk of insufficient care during the COVID pandemic. For those two above subgroups, and for others too, having a regular doctor helps ensure individuals get the health care they need. But Canada does not compare well to other industrialized countries when it comes to timely access to health-care services. Lack of access to care is often linked to Canada’s high level of unattached patients (those with no regular family physician or other primary care providers). About 15 per cent of Canadians are in this situation. Even worse, in Québec, the province hardest hit by COVID-19, close to 22 per cent have no regular provider of care. Targeted solutions Targeting these subgroups should be part of the policy package to address the implications of COVID-19. Ensuring that all Canadians have a regular provider of care shall also stay high on the policy and political agendas, even though it is not absolutely necessary for the primary care provider to be a physician. Efforts to address this issue, like the creation of a centralized waiting list, have shown mixed effectiveness. During COVID-19, accelerating formal enrolment with a family physician for those on a centralized waiting list in Québec goes in the right direction. But this will work only if patients can attend the clinic. The use of telemedicine has increased during the pandemic. (Pexels/Canva) The use of telemedicine has jumped during the pandemic, and while this may have helped those with chronic conditions, one issue is that there has been variation across provinces in incorporating telemedicine procedures in doctors’ billing schedules. In Ontario, the other hard hit province, more complications around the billings may have put some clinics in difficult financial situation and in turn affected access to care. And the telemedicine approach is likely to support women’s better access to care only if it is coupled with after-hours and weekend access, due to their typically higher familial responsibilities. Gaps in data Overall, the effects of delayed care cannot be underestimated. For example, non-urgent procedures and elective surgeries in Ontario have been postponed for more than two months, with the queue building up as new and postponed patients seek care. One issue is that in Canada, we do not know exactly how much care has been postponed or foregone. Other countries like France and the United States are able to report this information publicly. While progress is made on the data front, and more co-ordination across provinces is on the way, what Canada needs is a better health data infrastructure and reporting system, not only for managing the pandemic, but also for ensuring everyone’s health-care needs are met.

Partners View all partners Candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump at the final presidential debate. AP/Julio Cortez Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden met on Oct. 22 for the final debate in the 2020 election and, like the first debate, it was unusual. COVID-19 forced social distancing and largely took the studio audience, with their laughter, cheering and booing out of the equation. What’s more, with norm-breaking interruptions and stealing of speaking time an inherent part of Donald Trump’s debate strategy, the contentious crosstalk between the two candidates and the moderator made long sections of the candidates’ first debate nearly impossible to hear or follow. The threat of having the microphone cut off effectively muted this aggression. But is what they say as important as we think? Although news coverage generally focuses on what the candidates say, as a political psychologist who studies nonverbal behavior, I focus less on the rehearsed answers and more on the space between talking points. These moments, when candidates nonverbally – and largely involuntarily – respond to their opposition can be enormously revealing. In other words, how people listen and react may speak louder than what they say. Biden Biden laughs off a Trump attack. C-SPAN During this debate Joe Biden reacted as the emotionally expressive politician he has been throughout his career. Even when directly dealing with attacks from Trump, whether aimed at his family or his record, Biden often smiled, laughed and shook his head while closing his eyes. That made him appear bemused, if not jovial. Research suggests that people in informal discussions often change topics within 30 seconds of laughter occurring. This, in turn may be why people – especially politicians - “laugh off” insults. Laughter when under attack likely signals that Biden feels positive enough to be playful and that he is subtly taking control of the conversation. Trump A signature Trump expression known as the ‘lip funneler.’ C-SPAN Trump presented a much less aggressive and more thoughtful face to the American public during this second debate, especially when compared to the first one. Instead of directly attacking Biden when his assertions were questioned, Trump responded with what may best be termed a controlled-posed smile, in which his lower lip is pressed up while his lip corners were pulled up in a smile. This type of smile is often used to mask negative emotions or to signal positive emotions when they are not felt. Perhaps Trump’s signature facial display is his protruding funneled lips. This lip funneler – as it is referred to by facial display researchers – can often be seen while Trump is listening and preparing to interrupt or respond to Biden. The research that exists about this behavior in humans suggests it is a primal display often occurring during intense emotional situations and is associated with anger and threats while engaging in dominance-seeking behavior. Much can be learned about each candidate with the noise turned down and the attention placed squarely on their distinct nonverbal behavior styles. This is especially the case when focusing on how the candidates respond to their opposition’s assertions and attacks. Public figures can often control how they act. However, they often do not have as much control over how they react in the heat of the moment. [Expertise in your inbox.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger This past summer, many students were not able to fill the suggested 700 farming jobs funded by the federal government due to geographical or transportation barriers, limited positions or career irrelevance. At the same time, there was a larger demand for food grown locally in response to initial concerns about international imports during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. News stories from earlier this year covered farm problems such as milk dumping, produce dumping, an anticipated rise in meat prices and concern about a lack of agricultural production to feed the country. Read more: 100 days of coronavirus has sent shock waves through the food system Since March, farmers have continued selling at farmers markets, have sold out of community-supported agriculture (CSA) shares and responded to an increased demand as more people have taken up homesteading activities such as home cooking, gardening and canning. This turn to local food, a more plant-based diet and home-based food production has been recommended by health professionals, climate scientists and community resilience builders alike. As graduate and medical student researchers, we see that the potential silver lining of COVID-19 health measures may be the fostering of a healthier lifestyle and building community resilience. A pile of fresh garlic in bunches ready for pickup and market delivery. Ontario garlic prices have risen this summer as a response to rising demand in local foods and fears that imports will be affected. (Kimberly Hill-Tout), Author provided Health benefits The most recent version of Canada’s Food Guide was released in March 2020. There was a stark contrast — the new guide was a move away from its lobbyist-informed predecessor. It recommended daily foods comprising half vegetables and fruit, and in the protein section there was reference to alternative protein sources such as beans, nuts, legumes and tofu. Plant-based diets have for years now been the recommendation for maintaining a healthy body weight, reducing one’s risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. These diets can also lower cholesterol, slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, help with digestion by increasing fibre intake and reduce the risk of developing hypertension . Eating locally also means that there are fewer chances for food-borne contamination, and better contact tracing within local systems. For example, red onions imported from the United States were the cause of a salmonella outbreak in Canada, infecting 457 people. Community benefits Community resilience is the ability of a community to survive and recover from adverse situations and events. Essentially, the resources that a community has — like food — can be affected by an event, and then adapt and grow in a way that will be more effective to withstanding future adverse events. Social networks can be a crucial part of building community resiliency. The growing interest in local food as a reaction to COVID-19 can ultimately build social networks through farmer and non-farmer interactions as people seek out local farms and attend farmers markets. An additional factor that builds community resilience is the increased interest in home skills. During quarantine, there was a surge of people taking up home cooking both as a necessary action as well as for stress relief. People also took up baking, preserving foods, gardening and crafting. Read more: Before DIY sourdough starters became popular, there was home economics This skill building creates community resilience because people learn to manipulate their resources. Whether it be in the form of stress relief or becoming less dependent on outsourced labour, people “bounced forward,” developing and adapting new methods and skills to mitigate future adversities. Barriers to access There are also limitations to the surge of interest in local food and skill-based activities. Similar to the inaccessibility of organic foods to households without disposable income, the affordability of local foods and access to farmers markets during COVID-19 can be a challenge to individuals without transportation or financial means. An example is Knuckle Down Farm in Stirling, Ont. A small share costs $20 per week, while a large share costs $35 per week, which works out to be between $400 and $700 for a 20-week commitment. These need to be picked up weekly at the farm itself, which is inaccessible by transit. The price increases by $5 per week for delivery to the Toronto region, where it would still need to be picked up from an east-end address. Encouraging healthy diets during a pandemic The federal government needs to consider both larger social factors involved in overcoming adverse conditions and support communities that are in need of assistance. CERB financial relief can help cover a few monthly costs, but may not help everyone in taking up healthier diets or fostering community resilience. To increase access and participation in local food markets, governments need to subsidise local food and deter the dumping of agricultural goods. Community resilience can also be encouraged by offering courses in skills-based activities like food prep and preserving. COVID-19 has disrupted and changed the way we live our lives. Food can provide a means to encourage healthy diets, improve community relationships and address social inequalities as a way to enhance community resilience.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The government of Canada has announced the details of its $1.7 billion Universal Broadband Fund, pledging to connect 98 per cent of Canadians to high-speed internet by 2026. The news follows Ontario’s, which recently announced $1 billion over six years to support the expansion and improvement of broadband and cellular internet access. The emphasis is on meeting the economic and social needs that higher-speed, reliable and affordable internet access offers residential and business users during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In Ontario, the investment includes the 2019 $315-million initiative called Up to Speed: Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan, which has funds earmarked to pre-existing regional broadband networks in southwestern, eastern and northern Ontario. It also comprises the Improving Connectivity in Ontario (ICON) program that doubled the $150 million initially pledged in June 2020 to $300 million. Broadband and cellular internet access programs like ICON expect to leverage $900 million from co-funding applicants that typically include telecommunication service providers, municipal governments, First Nation communities and other for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. These groups have the expertise needed to design, implement and respond to the need for improved connectivity in their communities. The persistence of the digital divide in Canada is a perennial and growing policy, economic and social problem. The pandemic literally brought home our dependence on modern telecommunications. COVID-19 has induced further digital transformation as businesses moved online to serve customers; schools created virtual classrooms and technology use for students’ success and experts like doctors and judges switched to online consultations and cloud-based information systems. Cost savings In 2018, as researchers at the University of Guelph’s Regional and Rural Broadband (R2B2) project, we tracked southwestern Ontario’s “telecommuter surplus” and identified an average of $12,000 in savings per employee working from home three days a week. We estimate that at least half of residential internet users across southern Ontario are currently working remotely full-time during the COVID-19 pandemic. New data from Durham Region indicates that for three days a week, the remote worker saves nearly $19,000, with an estimated annual environmental benefit of 3,205 kilograms of carbon dioxide offset by not commuting an average of 96 kilometres per day. There is little doubt that Ontarians all over the province need improved connectivity. R2B2 researchers recently examined more than 18 million internet connection tests conducted by Ontarians in 2019 and found average effective download speeds below five Mbps for 127 out of 740 grouped communities in Ontario. This means that 17 per cent of Ontario communities were found to have extremely poor quality internet access. Being on the wrong side of the digital divide means regularly experiencing strained bandwidth where Zoom meetings drop their connections or you need to stop your video. Cloud-based files cannot be uploaded or downloaded quickly, or not for real time tele-meetings. R2B2 research in Durham Region also recently found that 63 per cent of wireless and mobile users were exceeding their data allowance at maximum monthly cost as high as $2,000. Many Canadians need faster, affordable and more reliable broadband to work and study from home, as well as to bounce back from the loss of employment or to launch home-based businesses due to COVID-19. Rural areas are hard hit even in relatively more densely populated communities of southern Ontario, for example, in Halton Region, Durham Region and the City of Hamilton, where R2B2 supported data collection, analysis and mapping. Farmers, cottagers and business groups Various stakeholder associations representing farmers, cottagers, municipalities, business and trade groups advocate for improved connectivity in Ontario. Their voices likely helped to increase the amount and release of investment made by the recently announced provincial and federal programs. Cottagers are among those in Ontario who have demanded better broadband. (Mark Olsen/Unsplash) Communities across the nation are already organizing themselves to secure better broadband and cellular connectivity. The federal government invites communities interested in better broadband and cellular connectivity to use their new call-in telephone number, 1-800-328-6189, that provides information and support. We cannot emphasize enough how essential it is to support internet access funding as a form of economic stimulus so that all Canadians can make their way through COVID-19, and our economy and society can recover from it as soon as possible.

Partners University of Melbourne provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In the United States, democratic norms are breaking down. The president, Donald Trump, baselessly claimed at a White House press conference on Friday morning, Australian time, that the presidential election has been stolen from him by fraudulent and corrupt electoral processes. This confronted the television networks, whose job is to report the news, with an acute dilemma. In an already volatile political atmosphere, do they go on reporting these lies, laced with an undertone of veiled incitement to violence? Or do they cut away on the grounds that by continuing to broadcast this stuff, they are helping to propagate lies and perhaps to oxygenate a threat to the civil peace? Major networks tune out Many of the major networks — MSNBC, NBC News, CNBC, CBS News and ABC News — decided to cut away. So did National Public Radio. MSNBC presenter Brian Williams said of Trump’s speech: It was not rooted in reality and at this point, where our country is, it’s dangerous. CNBC presenter, Shepard Smith, said the network was not going to allow it to keep going because what Trump was saying was not true. CNN and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News broadcast Trump’s entire press conference but immediately afterwards challenged what he said. CNN’s fact-checker Daniel Dale said it had been the most “dishonest” speech Trump had ever given, with anchor Jake Tapper saying Trump’s statements were “pathetic” and “a feast of falsehoods”. Fox’s host Martha MacCallum said the supposed evidence and proof of election misconduct would need to be produced. Even Murdoch’s New York Post, which had endorsed Trump’s re-election, accused him of making “baseless” election fraud claims, quoting a Republican Congressman as saying they were “insane”. The Washington Post carried two news stories on its front page, clearly calling out Trump’s lies: “Falsehood upon falsehood”; “A speech of historic dishonesty”. A serious decision to silence the President But what of the networks’ decision to cut away? Silencing a public official in the course of his official duties is a very serious abrogation of the media’s duty in a democracy. But so is allowing the airwaves to be used in such a way as to arouse fears for public confidence in the democratic process and — as MSNBC’s Williams argued — even public safety. Caption text. Shawn Thew/ EPA On the run, many of the big networks prioritised public confidence in the democratic process, and public safety, over the reporting of the president’s words. It is a rare circumstance in any democratic society that the media are placed in the position of having to shoulder such a heavy burden of responsibility. It is most unlikely that once the present crisis is over, assuming Democrat candidate Joe Biden wins, the American media will find themselves in this position again. Even so, a Rubicon has been crossed. A president of the United States, a publicly elected official, has been silenced by significant elements of the professional mass media in the course of his public duties. Read more: Grattan on Friday: A Biden presidency would put pressure on Scott Morrison over climate change This was done principally on the grounds he was lying to the people in circumstances where there was a foreseeable risk of serious harm to the body politic, and there was no practicable way to reduce the risk. Is that a standard the media is prepared to set for the future? If so, it would be giving itself a power that goes well beyond anything the media has claimed for itself up till now. Journalists need to keep their nerve In considering this, two questions arise. What if all media outlets had adopted this course? No one except those at the White House press conference would have known the whole of what Trump said, seen the context and observed the demeanour with which he said it. Would it have been enough to do as CNN and Fox did — report the speech and then repudiate it? Read more: 5 types of misinformation to watch out for while ballots are being counted – and after An answer to that would be: the lies were coming so thick and fast, and were so damaging to the public interest, that it would have been impossible to set the record straight in anything like real time. Real-time fact-checking is a relatively new development, and a welcome one. But its feasibility should not be a criterion for deciding whether to publish breaking news, unless there is doubt about whether the breaking news is actually happening. The networks that cut away doubtless acted in good faith to do right by the country. Trump’s speech was shocking and irresponsible. Trump supporters have taken to the streets since the polls closed on November 3. Nicole Hester/AP However, American democracy is in crisis. At this time, above all, the public needs the institution of the fourth estate to keep its nerve and a clear head. A primary norm of journalism is to inform the public. That certainly means being fair and accurate. But if the news contains lies, the norm is to publish and then call out the lying and set the record straight as soon as possible. The networks need to explain to their audiences their reasoning behind the decision to cut away, and the media as a whole need to realise that if the norms of journalism break down, that just adds to the tragic chaos into which their country has descended.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger After a surreal election campaign in the midst of a pandemic, we’re still not sure of the outcome — either Donald Trump won a second term, or Joe Biden will become the next president. Although pre-election polls showed Trump heading for certain defeat, he once again defied pollsters. Viewed by many as a referendum on Trump’s first term, and indeed on the man himself, the election was one of the most tumultuous in American history. The outcome is still not clear because ballots are still being counted in key battleground states. Like Hillary Clinton four years ago, Joe Biden positioned himself as the keeper of former president Barack Obama’s progressive ideology. In contrast, Trump promised an “America First” platform of limiting immigration and protecting United States trade interests — a stance that has included, at times, taking aim at Canada, the country’s closest trading partner. Read more: Canada needs to see the U.S. and its trade motives clearly What’s ahead for Canada? For Canadians, a Trump victory would essentially mean more of the same but perhaps at a lower decibel level. Justin Trudeau has managed his relationship with Trump as well as anyone could. Pipelines, steel, aluminum, agriculture and forestry products will continue to be on Trump’s agenda and will be trade irritants between the two countries. The reality is that Canadian interests — whether on trade, global climate change, foreign affairs or other matters — don’t align with America’s, regardless of the president in power. A President Biden, on the other hand, will mean a period of uncertainty as a new administration takes charge. But if Trump remains in power, there will be little ambiguity in the Canada-U.S. relationship. Canada and the battleground states As in 2016, this election will be decided by a trio of battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. The ballots are still being counted, but Biden has been declared the winner in Wisconsin, though Trump is demanding a recount. Trump won all three states in 2016, which helped carry him to victory. These swing states are critical because they routinely shift between voting for the Democratic presidential nominee and the Republican nominee. Most states vote for the same party election after election. California, for example, with its 55 electoral college votes (more than one-fifth all the electoral votes needed to become president), has overwhelmingly voted Democrat for decades. With little likelihood of that changing, both Biden and Trump did almost no campaigning in California. In contrast, Ohio — one of the battleground states won handily by Trump this election — sways back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. And since 1944, the state has only once voted for the losing candidate, choosing Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy in 1960. In this Oct. 21, 1960, photo, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon debate in a New York studio. (AP Photo) These battleground states — some of them lining the Canadian border — played an outsized role in this campaign. Trump and Biden did most of their campaigning in these states during the past months knowing that every vote they could obtain counted. Trump’s “America First” policies resonate with voters along the northern border, some living so close to Canada that they may imagine the loss of their assembly plant or farm to a foreign entity, as outlandish and unlikely as that may seem to Canadians. Perhaps one day Trudeau will have the opportunity to remind Trump, if he wins re-election, that his second term was in large measure due to support from the states with the closest economic and cultural ties to Canada. Trump’s imprint on the U.S. Beyond his populist style, Trump will have four more years to leave deep marks on America should he win a second term. He is the only person ever elected president without prior government or military experience. He is the oldest person to serve as president. During his tenure, three Supreme Court justices were confirmed, reshaping the court for a generation. Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton only had two justices confirmed during their eight-year terms. Likely more appointments could occur during a second term. The question for Trump is whether to seek out new avenues to leave a legacy, or to solidify the shifts he has engineered so far. If the former, then working more closely with Canada on matters such as trade disputes with China or immigration policy would be reasonable options. This could certainly happen under a Biden presidency — Obama and Trudeau had a “bromance,” and Biden could pick up where Obama left off in terms of a positive working relationship with his Canadian counterpart. Biden and Trudeau walk down the Hall of Honour on Parliament Hill in Ottawa in December 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Patrick Doyle Regardless, if he’s won re-election, Trump — perhaps for the first time in his life — may feel he has nothing more to prove. This may create openings for policy innovation. Canadian policy-makers would be wise to seek to present some of these to the White House, such as on tourism and regional development that are win-win for Canada and the U.S. Biden and the Democrats In some ways, Biden was an odd choice as standard bearer for Democrats eager to portray themselves as a party of new ideas and change. The last five Democratic presidents — Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Obama — were, on average, 30 years younger when they took office than Biden. Many in Canada prefer Biden to Trump. Democratic presidents have historically had better personal relationships with Liberal prime ministers than Republican presidents have. A Biden presidency holds the promise that Canada could be treated with more respect and care, even if the underlying disagreements remain. Kamala Harris is seen in a high school yearbook entry from the 1981 Westmount Secondary School, in Montréal. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Stephane Blais Kamala Harris is also a bright spot for the U.S.-Canada relationship. Regardless of whether Biden or Trump is the winner, she’ll have an excellent opportunity to become the Democratic presidential nominee in four years (should a President Biden opt not to run again). Having spent her teenage years in Montréal, Canadians dismayed at the prospect of four more years of Trump can seek solace that the next president may be someone with a personal Canadian connection.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a massive allocation of resources towards producing solutions, from identifying life-saving medications, tracking how the virus spreads and ultimately to preventing infection with vaccines. As a physician scientist, I study how the virus has evolved over the pandemic, since any changes in the virus could also change the effectiveness of current treatments. On Nov. 9, Pfizer announced preliminary trial results showing that a vaccine it developed with BioNTech was about 90 per cent effective. That was followed up nine days later with final trial results and two months of safety data, indicating a 95 per cent effectiveness rate. Pfizer announced on Nov. 18 that it intends to file for emergency authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, on Nov. 16, Moderna announced preliminary results for its own vaccine, developed with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which also indicated effectiveness of about 95 per cent. This is good news, but we need to understand what it means so life can ultimately go back to normal. DNA, messenger RNA and proteins Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines are mRNA-based. In each of our cells, DNA produces messenger RNA (mRNA) containing the templates for making proteins. It’s called messenger RNA because it carries that information to other parts of the cell, where the instructions are read and followed to produce specific proteins. 3D print of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Spike proteins cover the surface of the virus and enable it to enter and infect human cells. (NIH), CC BY When a patient is injected with mRNA in a vaccine, their cells use the information in that mRNA to create a protein: in this case, a version of the spike protein from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The immune system recognizes that protein as a signal to produce antibodies and immune cells. An mRNA vaccine has some advantages for mass vaccination. It can produce robust immunity, can be made rapidly at low cost, and, like inactivated and subunit vaccines, it is impossible for it to cause someone to develop the illness. Building immunity This vaccine has the potential to protect many people from this devastating virus. When it is said that a vaccine is 90 per cent effective, this means that if 100 people received the vaccine and were then exposed to the virus, 90 would be unlikely to get sick. While 10 would be at risk of still developing the infection, fortunately protection from vaccines is not all-or-nothing. These 10 individuals could have milder disease than someone who did not receive the vaccine. Pedestrians walk past Pfizer world headquarters in New York on Nov. 9, 2020. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) It takes time for immune systems to prepare to fight infections. Think of building immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, like preparing to run a marathon. First, the runner must register, just as the immune system must be exposed to the infectious agent. Then, they need to build stamina. For the immune system, this means making antibodies and immune cells. Finally, they run the marathon: the bolstered immune system now removes the infectious agent from the body, or prevents it from doing further damage. In both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials, subjects received the vaccine in two doses, three or four weeks apart, respectively. That’s about how much time it takes for the stimulated immune system to produce meaningful protection. A booster vaccine was given to produce even more antibodies and immune cells. In terms of the marathon example, this is like doing a practice marathon around three weeks into training. The runner will do better than they would have on day one, but more training is likely still needed. The booster vaccine provides that extra training. The beginning of the end Should we expect the pandemic to be over once a vaccine is available for public use? Not exactly. A vaccine will not be perfect, and it takes time for the immune system to be ready to protect us. A man stands outside an entrance to a Moderna building in Cambridge, Mass., on May 18, 2020. (AP Photo/Bill Sikes) In addition, it is possible that the vaccines will be less effective than cited. Clinical trials are carefully set up, but it is possible that the virus will have evolved enough since the vaccines were designed so they will provide less benefit. It will also take time for enough vaccine to be made and administered for the population to achieve herd immunity. Masks and social distancing will still most likely be necessary throughout 2021 because it takes time to accomplish such large-scale projects. We cannot expect herd immunity from our neighbours getting sick to get the world back to normal, even while neighbours are receiving vaccines. The human cost is unacceptable and the virus is too infectious for this to produce meaningful results unless 67 per cent of the population is infected, with a lot of people dying up to that point and afterwards. We are in a scary time but have reason to have hope. The news of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is good news and could potentially bring the world back to something more normal. We must not forget that it will take time and all of us working together. Masks and social distancing are our reality right now, and will remain so until at least next year. We must persevere with these measures, even when we find them frustrating. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and we can all reach it if we work together.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The government of Canada has announced the details of its $1.7 billion Universal Broadband Fund, pledging to connect 98 per cent of Canadians to high-speed internet by 2026. The news follows Ontario’s, which recently announced $1 billion over six years to support the expansion and improvement of broadband and cellular internet access. The emphasis is on meeting the economic and social needs that higher-speed, reliable and affordable internet access offers residential and business users during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In Ontario, the investment includes the 2019 $315-million initiative called Up to Speed: Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan, which has funds earmarked to pre-existing regional broadband networks in southwestern, eastern and northern Ontario. It also comprises the Improving Connectivity in Ontario (ICON) program that doubled the $150 million initially pledged in June 2020 to $300 million. Broadband and cellular internet access programs like ICON expect to leverage $900 million from co-funding applicants that typically include telecommunication service providers, municipal governments, First Nation communities and other for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. These groups have the expertise needed to design, implement and respond to the need for improved connectivity in their communities. The persistence of the digital divide in Canada is a perennial and growing policy, economic and social problem. The pandemic literally brought home our dependence on modern telecommunications. COVID-19 has induced further digital transformation as businesses moved online to serve customers; schools created virtual classrooms and technology use for students’ success and experts like doctors and judges switched to online consultations and cloud-based information systems. Cost savings In 2018, as researchers at the University of Guelph’s Regional and Rural Broadband (R2B2) project, we tracked southwestern Ontario’s “telecommuter surplus” and identified an average of $12,000 in savings per employee working from home three days a week. We estimate that at least half of residential internet users across southern Ontario are currently working remotely full-time during the COVID-19 pandemic. New data from Durham Region indicates that for three days a week, the remote worker saves nearly $19,000, with an estimated annual environmental benefit of 3,205 kilograms of carbon dioxide offset by not commuting an average of 96 kilometres per day. There is little doubt that Ontarians all over the province need improved connectivity. R2B2 researchers recently examined more than 18 million internet connection tests conducted by Ontarians in 2019 and found average effective download speeds below five Mbps for 127 out of 740 grouped communities in Ontario. This means that 17 per cent of Ontario communities were found to have extremely poor quality internet access. Being on the wrong side of the digital divide means regularly experiencing strained bandwidth where Zoom meetings drop their connections or you need to stop your video. Cloud-based files cannot be uploaded or downloaded quickly, or not for real time tele-meetings. R2B2 research in Durham Region also recently found that 63 per cent of wireless and mobile users were exceeding their data allowance at maximum monthly cost as high as $2,000. Many Canadians need faster, affordable and more reliable broadband to work and study from home, as well as to bounce back from the loss of employment or to launch home-based businesses due to COVID-19. Rural areas are hard hit even in relatively more densely populated communities of southern Ontario, for example, in Halton Region, Durham Region and the City of Hamilton, where R2B2 supported data collection, analysis and mapping. Farmers, cottagers and business groups Various stakeholder associations representing farmers, cottagers, municipalities, business and trade groups advocate for improved connectivity in Ontario. Their voices likely helped to increase the amount and release of investment made by the recently announced provincial and federal programs. Cottagers are among those in Ontario who have demanded better broadband. (Mark Olsen/Unsplash) Communities across the nation are already organizing themselves to secure better broadband and cellular connectivity. The federal government invites communities interested in better broadband and cellular connectivity to use their new call-in telephone number, 1-800-328-6189, that provides information and support.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March, millions of Canadians switched from working in a central office location to working from home. Days turned into weeks, and weeks have turned into months. Now it’s almost 2021, and millions of employees in Canada still work from home full time with no end in sight. Many Canadians wish to continue working remotely once the pandemic ends, which raises the question: Is remote work here to stay? For millions of employees, the answer will depend on what their senior management decides. In my recent research, I analyzed the language used by chief executive officers (CEOs) in quarterly earnings calls with investors and analysts. While the discussion of remote work was limited in the years prior to 2020, it was central in the public companies’ earnings calls this year. Based on my analysis of hundreds of such calls, I will sketch what some of Canada’s top CEOs believe about remote work and its future in the corporate landscape. Do CEOs think remote work is effective? Some jobs are better suited for remote work than others. Call centre staff, for example, are great candidates for remote work because their jobs involve little collaboration and their productivity is easily measured. Call centre staff have had a particularly smooth transition to remote work, CEOs say. (Petr Machacek/Unsplash) For this reason, it’s not surprising that CEOs of basic service companies — those in banking, telecommunication and insurance — that collectively employ hundreds of thousands of call centre staff were the first to claim a successful transition to remote work. Videotron CEO Jean-Francois Pruneau confirmed on his company’s earnings call last August that his call centre staff is “assuring the same standards of excellence for our customers.” Bell CEO Mirko Bibic stated: “By mid-April, service levels were back to what they were pre-COVID and our call centres resumed full hours of operation at the beginning of June.” Roy Gori, CEO of Manulife, explained that the transition was seamless because the company “already had a matured work from home culture.” For jobs that require collaboration among employees, and for which productivity is harder to measure, transitioning to remote work can be more challenging. Consequently, team managers are more skeptical about how productive employees are when they work from home. Ed Sonshine, head of Riocan, is dubious about the effectiveness of working from home. (RioCan) Edward Sonshine, CEO of the real-estate investment trust RioCan, illustrated this skepticism in July when he said to his investors: “Anybody who says everybody’s just as efficient working from their dining room table with a laptop as they are in an office doesn’t live in the real world.” After spending some time working from home, however, many CEOs began to view remote work in a favourable light. Michel Letellier, CEO of the renewable energy company Innergex, said: “I must say that it changed the way I see work from home. I was a little bit skeptical at the beginning, but boy, it shows that we could still be quite efficient.” Rob Peabody, CEO of Husky Energy, said that working from home “worked a lot better than I think all of us thought it was going to work.” In the same vein, Alexandre L’Heureux, CEO of the engineering consulting giant WSP Global, initially expressed doubts in his May call before admitting in August that “the organization proved me wrong.” Will Canadians work remotely after COVID-19? Isolation is one of the main issues faced by employees who work from home. When employees are separated from the office and each other, teams are at risk of losing their sense of togetherness. For some CEOs, the possibility of damaging the company culture is a deal-breaker. Gary Berman, CEO of Tricon Residential, stated in August: “We really believe our culture is manifested and strengthened by being together in a physical office. And so, we will try to go back to that when we can.” BlackBerry CEO John Chen takes part in an event at BlackBerry QNX Headquarters in Ottawa in February 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick For many CEOs, however, the optimal solution might end up being a compromise between working from home and going to the office each week. For example, John Chen, Blackberry’s CEO, said in his September earnings call: “If everybody worked from home forever, it will hurt productivity, it will hurt innovation. But I think there will be a hybrid model.” Gord Johnson, CEO of the engineering services company Stantec, said in August that the majority of his staff “want to go back to the office,” but could “work from home one day a week or two days a week.” Read more: Working from home during COVID-19: What do employees really want? Remote work and the future of urbanization It didn’t take long for many CEOs and chief financial officers (CFOs) to realize that letting employees work from home would significantly reduce their real-estate footprint. Amy Shapero, CFO of the e-commerce platform Shopify, said in her company’s earnings call in July: “Most of our employees will work remotely on a permanent basis and leverage our office spaces when it makes sense.” In the same vein, Allan Brett, CFO of Descartes, announced in May the “closure of several office facilities across the business, where we determined that employees can permanently work remotely.” CEOs of large Canadian real-estate companies echo the future uncertainty of urban life. Mark Kenney, CEO of CAPREIT, said in August that although he doesn’t believe in the “end of urbanization … the desire to be in the core of a big city is eased right now.” Read more: The coronavirus pandemic is pushing Canadians out of cities and into the countryside Jamie Farrar, CEO of City Office REIT, said that “discussions with tenants and leasing brokers highlight the overall uncertainty regarding future space needs,” with tenants having difficulties “determining their future space requirements.” Although some CEOs remain skeptical about remote work, many have decided to make it a permanent fixture at their companies. In a recent ADP Canada survey, 61 per cent of millennials reported they’d be happier if they worked from home for part of the work week. Some companies have already identified that offering remote work options might help them recruit higher-profile and international talent.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger We are at a moment of overlapping planetary health emergencies: COVID-19 and climate change. Both have their origins at the intersection of humanity and the rest of the natural world, both exacerbate pre-existing health inequities and both have the ability to bring health systems and economies to their knees. The health impacts of COVID-19 are well-known — those of climate change less so. A new report by the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, an international collaboration among 38 leading academic institutions and U.N. agencies, shows that as the globe warms humans are experiencing increasing heat emergencies, wildfires, severe weather, trouble with food yields and potential for novel infectious diseases. We need to “multisolve” — manage COVID-19 and climate change at the same time, looking for the sweet spots where a single measure can deliver the triple-win of improving public health, contributing to a sustainable economy and reducing the drivers of future crises. The Canadian policy brief associated with the Lancet report has suggestions for doing just that. Protect our homes The report shows a record 2,700 heat-related deaths occurred among people over the age of 65 in Canada in 2018. Globally, the last two decades have seen a 59 per cent increase in heat-related mortality in older people. The economic costs are also growing: work hours lost due to extreme heat exposure were 81 per cent higher in 2015-19 compared to 1990-94. Immediate action is required. Many Canadians have had their living circumstances made precarious through COVID-19. In its fall budget update, the federal government announced $1 billion in funding, through the Rapid Housing Initiative, to be used for the construction of modular housing and affordable housing units. All of the projects funded through this and other federal construction and retrofit programs should be evaluated for their location relative to flood-prone areas, their ability to ensure adequate ventilation and air filtration to cope with heat emergencies and wildfire smoke, and their alignment with our goal of living in a net-zero nation by 2050. Clean the air We must also clear the air of the pollution we can control. The Lancet report shows that in 2018 there were 7,200 premature deaths in Canada related to fine particulate air pollution from human-caused sources. This is four times higher than the number of deaths from transport accidents. The largest portion, found by the Lancet to be over 30 per cent, was due to emissions from households, such as burning fuel for heating. That means that energy efficient retrofits can save lives! Read more: Canada's new climate plan: Q&A about Bill C-12 Pollution from cars, trucks and other transport was shown in the report to be responsible for 17 per cent of deaths due to fine particulates in 2018.

Investments in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and collective transport, such as electric vehicle charging stations and electric buses are huge wins for health. Cyclists commute in London, U.K., in July 2020. (Shutterstock) Active transport investments have the added benefit of increasing physical activity, which reduces chronic disease. A recent study showed that compared to those who commute by private motorized vehicles, all-cause mortality was reduced by 20 per cent in those who cycle, and 10 per cent in rail commuters, with walk commuting associated with a seven per cent lower incidence of cancer. In the United Kingdom, investments in cycling infrastructure have been found to deliver about five British pounds of health and social benefits for every pound invested Read more: 10 tips for coping with wildfire smoke, from a public health expert Build resilience Finally, we need to increase the resilience of health systems. In addition to ensuring health-care structures are prepared for floods and fires in terms of siting, adequate ventilation systems, and more, we must take another look at supply chains. We learned through the pandemic that producing personal protective equipment (PPE) at home helps to ensure its availability in the face of supply chain disruption. We’ve also seen the disadvantages of not having the ability to produce the leading COVID-19 vaccines at home. With climate set to drive further health-related emergencies as well as economic crises a shift from a culture of efficiency to one of resiliency is required. We could decrease our healthcare-related footprint and reduce the risk of supply disruption by switching to reusable medical supplies such as gowns and blood pressure cuffs. The proposed national formulary, a good first step towards a pharmacare system, can also serve as a list of essential medicines considered for domestic production. Co-ordinated work between the public and the private sector, potentially including the creation of new crown corporations, could help ensure supply of critical items, as it did during the Second World War. Read more: 7 lessons Canada should use from WW2 to fight the climate emergency A hinge moment Canada is now full of armchair epidemiologists, but few of us could draw an approximation of the country’s projected warming curve. A leap in understanding is required: this forecast must inform planning in all sectors. Canada is warming at about double the global rate. Under all feasible emission scenarios it will be about 1.8C warmer than a 1986-2005 baseline by the time today’s newborns are in their twenties, rising to 6C by the time they are in their 60s if we do not urgently decrease greenhouse gas emissions. As the Lancet report says, unless immediate action is taken this will threaten not only lives and livelihoods, but also compromise the hospitals and clinics we depend on. COVID-19 is a hinge moment in human society — a time to pause, to reset. Although health workers have been appropriately lauded through this pandemic for the care they are providing, it is becoming clear that from wearing masks to retrofitting our homes, we all share the responsibility, and the honour, of saving lives.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger J.K. Rowling famously wrote her Harry Potter series from local cafés and, eventually, out of a five-star hotel. She found that working from home had too many distractions, including child-care responsibilities. Instead, she simply needed a quiet and simulating place to work that was free of distractions and allowed her to be productive. Oprah Winfrey Network. Similarly, as we near the 10th month of mandated remote work, many employees working from home are struggling for a variety of reasons, just as Rowling did. Perhaps it’s time to rethink the concept of working from home versus working from anywhere safely. Between 40 per cent to 70 per cent of employees currently working remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions want to go back to the office, with safety measures in place. Having a dedicated, distraction-free work space can keep workers on task and foster deeper cognitive processing. It can also help separate work hours from non-work hours. Nonetheless, returning to the office isn’t likely an option since many businesses might remain closed well into 2021, or some might have moved permanently to a work-from-home model. Some workers might also be facing a lengthy commute if they’ve moved away from cities during the lengthy pandemic. Read more: Young workers can thrive after coronavirus layoffs by leaving big cities Meanwhile, the hotel industry across Canada has been severely and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of hotel workers are out of jobs. At the end of October 2020, Canadian hotels reported vacancy rates ranging from 64.4 per cent in British Columbia to 84.5 per cent in Québec. Many hotels are on the brink of collapse. A solution may be within reach that solves both problems. Similar to the “shop local” messaging encouraging consumers to buy from small neighbourhood retailers, working remotely from a nearby hotel could be a solution that benefits both remote workers and local hotels until the pandemic has passed. The negative side of working from home Working from home for the last 10 months has left some workers feeling isolated, depressed and disengaged. While there are many benefits associated with working from home, emotional exhaustion levels of workers increase when working from home extensively. The blurring of personal and professional space causes some employees to struggle switching off from work. This reduces cognitive well-being and negatively affects sleep quality. People working in a home crowded with family members also suffer from the “time elasticity illusion.” That happens when others assume the worker can spend time on household tasks without it having an impact on the amount of time spent on paid work. This involuntary overlap of household and work commitments leads to fatigue. Remote work and the blurring of professional and personal time can result in insomnia and fatigue. (Ben Blennerhassett/Unsplash) There’s a spillover effect of that fatigue. End-of-day work exhaustion leads to difficulties starting work and staying on task the following day. This can become a difficult cycle to break. Research shows that workers who focus on finding dedicated, distraction-free work spaces during peak efficiency hours are more productive and less stressed out about their jobs. Some employees like the structure of the workplace. (Unsplash) Studies also suggest the mundane routines of everyday working life like getting ready, eating breakfast and commuting make some people happy. Additionally, these routines create a buffer between personal and professional time. Some people also crave the normalcy and structure of the workplace. Others, especially parents, want to get away from the distractions of home. How do hotel workers benefit? Aligned with this, hotels have broadened their business model and started offering packages that are aimed at remote workers. Those working from home can access a local hotel on a day or special pass. These passes typically include special rates (daily, weekly or monthly), dedicated work spaces and waived fees for special services like gyms and pools. These services can both help workers overcome the strain of an exclusive work-from-home situation while giving a boost to local businesses. In 2019, there were more than 10,000 accommodation services businesses across Canada. Most of these employed between five to 99 employees. These jobs are often part-time, providing employment that is highly accessible to women, young workers and immigrants. Unfortunately, more than 50 per cent of hotel workers lost their jobs between January and June of 2020, with very little employment recovery since then. Breaking the cycle While hotels traditionally provide overnight accommodation for travellers, they can attract different clients by marketing themselves as safe, distraction-free, dedicated places to work for those who work from home and need to break the cycle of exhaustion. The use of hotel space by remote workers, even temporarily, can support employment of local hotel workers, creating a dual benefit at a time of uncertainty. If hotel rooms are sitting empty during the pandemic, why not put them to good use? (Ming Dai/Pixabay) And according to the World Health Organization, working from a hotel is safe if basic COVID-19 precautions are followed. These include washing hands frequently, wearing masks and maintaining a safe distance from others. Plexiglas shields or remote/keyless check-in, entry and checkout systems are also useful. If stressed-out workers and interested hoteliers need more information, the Hotel Association of Canada (HAC), in partnership with the Public Health Agency Canada, has created a COVID-19 portal providing information for hotels on a variety of safety measures and initiatives. In the meantime, some major hotel chains, including Marriott, Hilton and the Intercontinental, have launched work-from-hotel packages aimed at providing some relief for stressed-out people who need to get out of their homes to effectively do their jobs — or maybe even create the next Harry Potter phenomenon.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Maintaining social distancing inside retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a daily source of contention between retail workers and customers. Yet this distance is more than a safety regulation to front-line retail workers. Inside the store, this two-metre space has become a sign of respect and an acknowledgement of their humanity. Throughout the summer and fall of 2020, and as part of an ongoing research, we’ve been interviewing retail workers and customers in North America, asking them about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected retail stores, employees and customers. One common story we kept hearing was how many customers disregard social distancing when in the vicinity of store employees. Here are some comments from retail workers: “One thing that I found was quite interesting was when there’s recommendations for social distancing or physical distancing, you can see that customers would keep distance between them and other customers, but then they would disregard any sort of distance from staff member and employees.” “They get right up next to me, they’re showing me their phone, they’re handing me their stuff.… They don’t seem to respect us as employees; that we need our distance as well.” “It’s like they don’t see you as a person, they see you as a part of store so they can just interact with you as they normally would. I’ve had customers touch me. I’ve had customers come face-to-face with me. … It gets really tiresome having to keep backing away and they keep coming close to you. You ask them to stay back and they just ignore it. It makes you feel like you’re not a person, like they don’t see you as a human being. They see you as part of the store.” One Costco worker complained that this isn’t just a problem with regular customers, but also with shoppers for the Instacart personal shopping service: “Instacart will come and they have their list of what they have to shop for, but they want to get in and they want to get out as quick as possible. So, they approach a staff member and they have it on their phone, and they’ll put it right in your face like ‘Where’s this? Where’s this?’” While she sympathizes with Instacart shoppers who need to fulfil as many orders as they can, she calls their attitude towards store workers disrespectful and “awful.” “A lot of these Instacart people are people that have lost jobs due to COVID and this Instacart is kind of what they’re supplementing their income for, right? So, you can’t really blame them. But at the same time, they’re a pain because they’re creating some of this anarchy that goes on during your shift.” When asked about whether she feels safe or not at work, one of the interviewees nearly cried. She said: “Yes, we have to care about the safety of our customers and those who come to our stores, but we also have to care for us.” A holiday gesture While many of the interviewed retail workers expressed gratitude for being able to continue working when so many are out of work, they highlighted the increased stress in their work lives. A woman tries on earrings at the Swarovski store in Sherway Gardens Mall in Toronto. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston One of those major stressors is maintaining social distance with their customers during working hours. They also expressed concern about the limited compassion being shown by some of the customers. In the midst of the holiday shopping season, when many shoppers are flocking to shopping malls outside of lockdown zones, we need to keep in mind that retail workers have all the same concerns about contracting COVID-19 as we do. So whenever you enter a store, whether it’s a big box chain like Costco or Walmart or a small independent business, remember to “keep your distance.” It’s an important show of respect and compassion for the jobs retail workers do and the risks they face every day.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger J.K. Rowling famously wrote her Harry Potter series from local cafés and, eventually, out of a five-star hotel. She found that working from home had too many distractions, including child-care responsibilities. Instead, she simply needed a quiet and simulating place to work that was free of distractions and allowed her to be productive. Oprah Winfrey Network. Similarly, as we near the 10th month of mandated remote work, many employees working from home are struggling for a variety of reasons, just as Rowling did. Perhaps it’s time to rethink the concept of working from home versus working from anywhere safely. Between 40 per cent to 70 per cent of employees currently working remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions want to go back to the office, with safety measures in place. Having a dedicated, distraction-free work space can keep workers on task and foster deeper cognitive processing. It can also help separate work hours from non-work hours. Nonetheless, returning to the office isn’t likely an option since many businesses might remain closed well into 2021, or some might have moved permanently to a work-from-home model. Some workers might also be facing a lengthy commute if they’ve moved away from cities during the lengthy pandemic. Read more: Young workers can thrive after coronavirus layoffs by leaving big cities Meanwhile, the hotel industry across Canada has been severely and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of hotel workers are out of jobs. At the end of October 2020, Canadian hotels reported vacancy rates ranging from 64.4 per cent in British Columbia to 84.5 per cent in Québec. Many hotels are on the brink of collapse. A solution may be within reach that solves both problems. Similar to the “shop local” messaging encouraging consumers to buy from small neighbourhood retailers, working remotely from a nearby hotel could be a solution that benefits both remote workers and local hotels until the pandemic has passed. The negative side of working from home Working from home for the last 10 months has left some workers feeling isolated, depressed and disengaged. While there are many benefits associated with working from home, emotional exhaustion levels of workers increase when working from home extensively. The blurring of personal and professional space causes some employees to struggle switching off from work. This reduces cognitive well-being and negatively affects sleep quality. People working in a home crowded with family members also suffer from the “time elasticity illusion.” That happens when others assume the worker can spend time on household tasks without it having an impact on the amount of time spent on paid work. This involuntary overlap of household and work commitments leads to fatigue. Remote work and the blurring of professional and personal time can result in insomnia and fatigue. (Ben Blennerhassett/Unsplash) There’s a spillover effect of that fatigue. End-of-day work exhaustion leads to difficulties starting work and staying on task the following day. This can become a difficult cycle to break. Research shows that workers who focus on finding dedicated, distraction-free work spaces during peak efficiency hours are more productive and less stressed out about their jobs. Some employees like the structure of the workplace. (Unsplash) Studies also suggest the mundane routines of everyday working life like getting ready, eating breakfast and commuting make some people happy. Additionally, these routines create a buffer between personal and professional time. Some people also crave the normalcy and structure of the workplace. Others, especially parents, want to get away from the distractions of home. How do hotel workers benefit? Aligned with this, hotels have broadened their business model and started offering packages that are aimed at remote workers. Those working from home can access a local hotel on a day or special pass. These passes typically include special rates (daily, weekly or monthly), dedicated work spaces and waived fees for special services like gyms and pools. These services can both help workers overcome the strain of an exclusive work-from-home situation while giving a boost to local businesses. In 2019, there were more than 10,000 accommodation services businesses across Canada. Most of these employed between five to 99 employees. These jobs are often part-time, providing employment that is highly accessible to women, young workers and immigrants. Unfortunately, more than 50 per cent of hotel workers lost their jobs between January and June of 2020, with very little employment recovery since then. Breaking the cycle While hotels traditionally provide overnight accommodation for travellers, they can attract different clients by marketing themselves as safe, distraction-free, dedicated places to work for those who work from home and need to break the cycle of exhaustion. The use of hotel space by remote workers, even temporarily, can support employment of local hotel workers, creating a dual benefit at a time of uncertainty. If hotel rooms are sitting empty during the pandemic, why not put them to good use? (Ming Dai/Pixabay) And according to the World Health Organization, working from a hotel is safe if basic COVID-19 precautions are followed. These include washing hands frequently, wearing masks and maintaining a safe distance from others. Plexiglas shields or remote/keyless check-in, entry and checkout systems are also useful. If stressed-out workers and interested hoteliers need more information, the Hotel Association of Canada (HAC), in partnership with the Public Health Agency Canada, has created a COVID-19 portal providing information for hotels on a variety of safety measures and initiatives. In the meantime, some major hotel chains, including Marriott, Hilton and the Intercontinental, have launched work-from-hotel packages aimed at providing some relief for stressed-out people who need to get out of their homes to effectively do their jobs — or maybe even create the next Harry Potter phenomenon.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Welcoming the new year may feel a bit different this year, given the challenges of 2020 and the inability to celebrate together. For many people, the yearly date change — adding one more year to life’s tally — puts a greater focus on long-term goals than busy lives usually allow. For many, this leads to the tradition of New Year’s resolutions, a chance to consider our progress on becoming the “ideal self” many people hope to achieve by the end of their days. Even with the knowledge that the focus will shift back to the short-term demands of day-to-day by mid-January, it is valuable to consider those longer-term aspirations, if for no other reason than for people to remind themselves that there’s more to them than the harried exhausted person who, at the end of the day, wants nothing more than to get into their PJs and play a video game, binge-watch a favourite TV serial, or read a current novel. A new year may encourage people to think long-term, but — as this Seattle street mural on April 28, 2020 suggests — it’s more difficult to make long-term resolutions for 2021 given the uncertainty and restrictions brought about by the pandemic. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) But this year, thinking about the long-term is much more difficult. The pandemic has given us all a different experience of time. The pandemic has not only served as a visceral reminder that something unexpected can land in our well-envisioned path, halting all progress. It has also made the path beyond the pandemic unclear. As many pundits are noting, a “return to normal” — meaning life exactly as it was before COVID-19 entered our vocabulary — is highly unlikely. The future has become less predictable, which also means that setting long-term goals is much more difficult. It’s hard to imagine an ideal self without knowing what that self will be experiencing. Short-term goals As a psychologist, I think resolutions for 2021 should be much more short-term than usual. It is probably challenging enough to figure out what’s needed to make it through the months until everyone is vaccinated and can start to make their way back into a more social world. You might be thinking that this hardly seems like a good use of once-a-year resolutions, but even though these goals will be very short-term, this is valuable given that public health leaders are warning that these particular months are likely to be the hardest of the pandemic. So even though these goals will likely only be needed for a few months, they can be vital for determining our state when the pandemic comes to an end. Personal ‘points of pain’ can give people some idea of what resolutions they might make. (Pexels/Olya Kobruseva) Living through several months of pandemic uncertainty and restrictions has likely given many people a pretty good idea of which personal vulnerabilities this constrained life chafes against. Some people may be struggling to keep their emotional balance. For others, the absence of friends and even casual acquaintances may be driving them mad. Others might be panting to get back to the gym. These personal points of pain can give people some idea of what resolutions they might make. Addressing those specific points may help enable people to care for themselves well enough to arrive at the pandemic’s end with some semblance of good physical and mental health. Reviewing the advice that mental health professionals gave at the beginning of the pandemic may be helpful in figuring out your specific short-term resolutions to deal with personal challenges. Or you, like many others, might have discovered the healing properties of nature during this time, as documented in a preprint (not yet peer reviewed) study. If so, your resolutions could be about making sure you continue those activities and visiting your favourite nature spots during these winter months. My own resolution, for instance, is to spend at least five minutes each day appreciating the birds in my yard, which never fails to lift my spirits. Pandemic lessons For those who can’t resist thinking about long-term goals, despite the uncertainty that this pandemic year has introduced into the world, you could review what you’ve learned during the pandemic. Long-term resolutions could be based on consideration of three things: What do I want to keep from changes I made to cope with the pandemic? What do I want to reclaim from the pre-pandemic time? How would I “build back better” if I were in charge of the world or my neighbourhood? Each of these things will require some long-term goal focus, and can help you imagine a new ideal self for the post-pandemic times. Like Christmas 2020, New Year’s 2021 is likely to be unique in many people’s memories. Many people have gone out of their way to make these moments as tolerable as possible, given the circumstances, but these new ways to commemorate the holidays are unlikely to become traditions, or things people will want to repeat in subsequent years. Approaching 2021 resolutions by harvesting any bright spots or treasures that have revealed themselves during this unusual time may help illuminate a new path to follow once the pandemic has ended.

View all partners Languages Français English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Face masks reduce the spread of viruses passed on from respiratory secretions. While cloth masks are imperfect, widespread use of an imperfect mask has the potential to make a big difference in transmission of the virus. We started reading the research on cloth masks and face coverings at the start of the pandemic, looking for ways to protect our vulnerable dialysis patients and our dialysis staff. We found a total of 25 studies, advocated for mask use and summarized our findings in a peer-reviewed publication. We also created an evidence-based, plain-language website (www.clothmasks.ca) to help people navigate this area. Although mask use has been widely adopted, many people still have questions about them. I see spaces in the cloth. How can it stop particles? The virus that causes COVID-19 is about 0.1 micrometer in diameter. (A micrometer (µm) is one one-thousandth of a millimeter.) The holes in woven cloth are visible to the naked eye and may be five to 200 micrometers in diameter. It is counter-intuitive that cloth can be useful in this setting — it’s been compared to putting up a chain-link fence to stop mosquitoes. However, that analogy is wrong in many ways. According to aerosol science, whenever liquid hangs in air it is technically an aerosol, but other disciplines use the word “droplet” to mean a coarse particle five micrometers or larger, and reserve “aerosol” for fine particles smaller than five micrometers in effective diameter. When we breathe, talk, eat, cough, sneeze or sing, we emit particles across a range of sizes, both coarse and fine, and the virus is in those particles. Even though there are gaps between the threads in cloth, the threads are usually wider than the gaps. Also, at this microscopic level, the thread has thickness, or depth, so the gap is more a tunnel than a window. Microfilaments from broken or irregular threads project into the gap. The particle is not like a mosquito, which can redirect itself to avoid obstacles. A particle with momentum will run into a fibre, even though the air stream is diverted around it, like a ball hitting a wall — this is called impaction. Québec Premier François Legault puts on a Montréal Canadiens face mask as he finishes the daily COVID-19 press briefing on May 21, 2020 in Montréal. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz But at the microscopic level, there are two additional processes in play. Particles also fall out of the air — called sedimentation. Some particles are moving randomly and this random motion brings them into contact with fibres — called diffusion. Finally, cloth can be used in multiple layers, adding a second and third gauntlet for the particle to run before it reaches the other side. The point is not that some particles may penetrate the cloth, but that some are blocked. What are the best materials for cloth face masks? Based on our summary of 25 different studies, woven cotton, at least 100 threads per inch; flannel, either cotton or poly-cotton blend, at least 90 threads per inch; tea towel material; and heavy, good quality, cotton T-shirt material all performed well. This recommendation is based on the published data available, which doesn’t cover all possible mask materials: we didn’t find a lot of information on synthetic materials, for example, so we don’t know how they compare. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is smaller than the spaces between the threads of many types of cloth, wearing a cloth mask is not like trying to contain a mosquito with a chain-link fence. (Pixabay) Every study that looked at layering found that it made a difference, so we recommend that masks be made of at least two layers; three or four may be even better. We found evidence for multiple layers of the same fabrics and for sandwiches of different materials. We did not find good evidence of useful levels of filtration for disposable filters, like coffee filters, so we suggest not using them. For example, a two-layer T-shirt mask with a sewn edge — which prevents stretching — prevented 79 per cent of mouth bacteria reaching the environment during coughing. In the same experiment, a modern disposable medical mask performed in the same range at 85 per cent. Two studies of surgical masks from the 1960s and 1970s distinguished between coarse particles (sometimes called droplets) and fine particles (sometimes called aerosols). A four-layer cotton mask and a mask made of a sandwich of cotton and flannel both reduced mouth bacteria in particles of all sizes reaching the environment during talking by 99 per cent and mouth bacteria in fine particles by 89 per cent. This is all good evidence that cloth face coverings can prevent respiratory secretions from reaching the environment. Every coarse or fine particle trapped in a mask is not available to hang in the air or fall to a surface and contaminate it. “My mask protects you, your mask protects me”: if many people wear face coverings we expect the probability of transmission to fall. Can a cloth mask protect the person wearing it? We found four studies of inward filtration, all of which showed useful levels of filtration, all using the same widely-accepted technology that measures salt particles in the fine particle (0.02 to 1.0 micrometer) range. A study of one-layer tea-towel masks and a study of two-layer masks made of T-shirt material both showed at least 50 per cent protection for fine particles. Two cloth masks of unknown materials randomly purchased from street vendors performed just as well. For comparison, two of these studies — using exactly the same methods — examined how well modern disposable medical masks worked when tested on volunteers: they filtered around 80 per cent of fine particles. Three researchers from the University of Pittsburgh made complex masks with eight layers of pre-shrunk high-quality cotton T-shirts fitted to their own faces: each filtered more than 90 per cent of inward aerosol-sized fine particles, offering proof-of-concept for the idea of designing better cloth masks. Many of the cloth masks in current use are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them. (Pixabay) An animal experiment with tuberculosis bacteria provides further insight. Tuberculosis is usually considered an “airborne” disease, that is, one with an important transmission route through aerosols or fine particles. When caring for tuberculosis patients, health-care workers wear N95 masks, a high level of respiratory protection, to protect themselves and prevent onward transmission to others. When rabbits were exposed to aerosols of tuberculosis in controlled conditions, tuberculomas (infected abscesses) were reduced by 95 per cent in rabbits that wore close-fitting three- to six-layer gauze masks compared with those that did not. Many of the cloth masks in current use, therefore, are likely producing useful levels of filtration to the person wearing them, and we have proof-of-concept for improved cloth mask materials and design. At what rate of use do masks become beneficial? Two modelling studies predict that 50 per cent adoption of a 50 per cent effective mask will have an important effect on transmission, and that if either percentage is increased, transmission is further reduced. We need to work on making cloth masks more effective, but the masks that we have on hand have the potential to change the course of the pandemic, particularly if we almost all wear them. Mask mandates were imposed at different times in different states in the United States, creating a natural experiment. The COVID-19 daily growth rate fell by one per cent in the first five days and by two per cent at 21 days after a mask mandate was imposed. These effects are not small: they represent 16 to 19 per cent of the effects of other much more invasive measures (school closures, bans on large gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and closures of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues). Taken together, this suggests that cloth face coverings of the type currently available have the potential to reduce transmission, and that when cloth face coverings are mandated, the growth rate decreases. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle projected on Sept. 3 that an increase in mask usage from the current 60 per cent to 95 per cent, combined with enhanced local social distancing as needed, would reduce global deaths by three-quarters of a million people before the end of 2020. Are there any other benefits to wearing a mask? British Columbia provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry wears a face mask as she views the Murals of Gratitude exhibition in Vancouver, on July 3, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck A new hypothesis advanced by researchers at the University of California San Francisco suggests that cloth masks don’t just reduce the probability of infectious organisms reaching a person, but also the number of infectious organisms — and that a lower number of infecting organisms leads to less severe disease. Accumulating epidemiologic evidence from this pandemic suggests that when masks are worn, the overall severity of illness is lower. The proportion of those infected who remain asymptomatic is higher, and the probability of dying is lower. In animal experiments it is well known that the inoculum (the infecting dose) is related to disease severity. The threshold at which 50 per cent of animals in a group receiving the same dose die of infection is called the lethal-dose 50 (LD50). Experiments on mice using the coronaviruses MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, showed dose-response and in MERS-CoV established LD50. In hamsters separated by surgical masks between cages from hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the severity of infection was reduced compared with hamsters unprotected by masks. Further research on better cloth masks will be helpful. At the Centre of Excellence for Protective Equipment and Materials at McMaster, we hope to play a role in that work. However, even imperfect uptake and imperfect use of imperfect masks has the potential to have a surprisingly large impact during this pandemic. We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Welcoming the new year may feel a bit different this year, given the challenges of 2020 and the inability to celebrate together. For many people, the yearly date change — adding one more year to life’s tally — puts a greater focus on long-term goals than busy lives usually allow. For many, this leads to the tradition of New Year’s resolutions, a chance to consider our progress on becoming the “ideal self” many people hope to achieve by the end of their days. Even with the knowledge that the focus will shift back to the short-term demands of day-to-day by mid-January, it is valuable to consider those longer-term aspirations, if for no other reason than for people to remind themselves that there’s more to them than the harried exhausted person who, at the end of the day, wants nothing more than to get into their PJs and play a video game, binge-watch a favourite TV serial, or read a current novel. A new year may encourage people to think long-term, but — as this Seattle street mural on April 28, 2020 suggests — it’s more difficult to make long-term resolutions for 2021 given the uncertainty and restrictions brought about by the pandemic. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) But this year, thinking about the long-term is much more difficult. The pandemic has given us all a different experience of time. The pandemic has not only served as a visceral reminder that something unexpected can land in our well-envisioned path, halting all progress. It has also made the path beyond the pandemic unclear. As many pundits are noting, a “return to normal” — meaning life exactly as it was before COVID-19 entered our vocabulary — is highly unlikely. The future has become less predictable, which also means that setting long-term goals is much more difficult. It’s hard to imagine an ideal self without knowing what that self will be experiencing. Short-term goals As a psychologist, I think resolutions for 2021 should be much more short-term than usual. It is probably challenging enough to figure out what’s needed to make it through the months until everyone is vaccinated and can start to make their way back into a more social world. You might be thinking that this hardly seems like a good use of once-a-year resolutions, but even though these goals will be very short-term, this is valuable given that public health leaders are warning that these particular months are likely to be the hardest of the pandemic. So even though these goals will likely only be needed for a few months, they can be vital for determining our state when the pandemic comes to an end. Personal ‘points of pain’ can give people some idea of what resolutions they might make. (Pexels/Olya Kobruseva) Living through several months of pandemic uncertainty and restrictions has likely given many people a pretty good idea of which personal vulnerabilities this constrained life chafes against. Some people may be struggling to keep their emotional balance. For others, the absence of friends and even casual acquaintances may be driving them mad. Others might be panting to get back to the gym. These personal points of pain can give people some idea of what resolutions they might make. Addressing those specific points may help enable people to care for themselves well enough to arrive at the pandemic’s end with some semblance of good physical and mental health. Reviewing the advice that mental health professionals gave at the beginning of the pandemic may be helpful in figuring out your specific short-term resolutions to deal with personal challenges. Or you, like many others, might have discovered the healing properties of nature during this time, as documented in a preprint (not yet peer reviewed) study. If so, your resolutions could be about making sure you continue those activities and visiting your favourite nature spots during these winter months. My own resolution, for instance, is to spend at least five minutes each day appreciating the birds in my yard, which never fails to lift my spirits. Pandemic lessons For those who can’t resist thinking about long-term goals, despite the uncertainty that this pandemic year has introduced into the world, you could review what you’ve learned during the pandemic. Long-term resolutions could be based on consideration of three things: What do I want to keep from changes I made to cope with the pandemic? What do I want to reclaim from the pre-pandemic time? How would I “build back better” if I were in charge of the world or my neighbourhood? Each of these things will require some long-term goal focus, and can help you imagine a new ideal self for the post-pandemic times. Like Christmas 2020, New Year’s 2021 is likely to be unique in many people’s memories. Many people have gone out of their way to make these moments as tolerable as possible, given the circumstances, but these new ways to commemorate the holidays are unlikely to become traditions, or things people will want to repeat in subsequent years. Approaching 2021 resolutions by harvesting any bright spots or treasures that have revealed themselves during this unusual time may help illuminate a new path to follow once the pandemic has ended.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 has not only upended our personal lives, it has dramatically changed scientific research. In response to the rapid spread of the virus, scientists around the world have had to find new ways to collaborate and solve problems, all at speeds previously thought unimaginable. Indeed, until very recently, the idea that a new vaccine could be developed, tested and distributed in less than a year would have seemed impossible. The rapid pace at which science is moving is exciting. In addition to producing vaccines, scientists have found ways to prevent the virus from spreading, dispel pandemic myths and identify communities most at risk of falling ill. But the “warp speed” at which science is moving can also be dangerous, especially when inconclusive or unverified research studies gain public attention. As researchers studying science and health communication, our team has been paying close attention to the way one form of preliminary research — the preprint — makes its way to audiences. What are preprints? Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are posted online but haven’t been formally verified by the scientific community. Scientists use them for many reasons, from getting early feedback on new work to sharing findings that are important but may never make it into a journal. Preprints can also help make research more accessible because they are free to read, while many journal articles are not. They can also be published by scientists without any delays, as opposed to the many months (or even years) it takes for a study to go through peer review and be published in a journal. For some findings, waiting for a paper to pass through two or three independent researchers — or academic peers — who read the study and assess its rigour, originality and significance, is a manageable delay. But for others — like those about promising new drugs, prevention strategies or medical therapies — speed can make a big difference. In these cases, posting a preprint means that other scientists can start working on replicating the results right away, potentially allowing new treatments or vaccines to be approved months or even years ahead of schedule. This speed advantage is one reason that preprint use has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. When almost 800,000 people worldwide are falling ill every week, faster science isn’t just about convenience: It’s about saving lives. A 2019 panel presentation at Johns Hopkins University on the role of preprints in scholarly research. Preprints in the COVID-19 pandemic While preprints have an obvious advantage for scientists, things can get tricky when these preliminary studies make their way outside of the scientific community. Early in the pandemic, for example, two high profile preprints linking tobacco and COVID-19 prevention started to receive a lot of media coverage. Although the studies turned out to be highly flawed, many readers took the findings to heart, sparking unnecessary panic and encouraging smoking. The tentative nature of preprints is one reason journalists have historically been discouraged from reporting on them. But with the onset of the pandemic, and few relevant peer-reviewed studies to draw on, journalists were left with little choice but to cover these preliminary reports. Indeed, in the early months of the pandemic, COVID-19-related preprints were more than 200 times as likely to receive media coverage than preprints on other topics, according to a study posted (as a preprint) last year. In our peer-reviewed study, we found that, unfortunately, the preliminary nature of these studies wasn’t always communicated consistently. Of the more than 450 media stories we analyzed, only about half accurately portrayed preprints as being uncertain or unverified research. Surprisingly, it wasn’t just the newer, less traditional media outlets that failed to identify the research as preprints. Even established publications like the New York Times did not always describe the preprints they covered as preliminary. Staying critical and informed as science evolves While this coverage of preprints isn’t in and of itself a bad thing, it can be dangerous if the tentative nature of the science isn’t made transparent. Luckily, journalism associations are starting to develop recommendations for covering preprints responsibly. Preprint servers, or online collections, like bioRxiv and medRxiv, have also started posting “warning” messages alongside new studies to remind readers not to treat the findings as established facts. Until these best practices become commonplace, however, it’s up to all of us to develop the skills we need to make responsible and well-founded decisions about our health. Learn to read science papers critically, remember to fact check questionable claims, and, most importantly, always think before you share. As science communicator Liz Neeley so aptly put it, “We are all science communicators now: COVID-19 has conscripted us.” Preprints may be here to stay, but if we learn to communicate responsibly about this preliminary research, the confusion they generate doesn’t have to be.

View all partners Languages Français English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Amid the carnage of the First World War, a flu epidemic took hold in the front-line trenches and subsequently spread around the world, infecting one-quarter of the world’s total population and ultimately killing more people than the war itself. Before it was over, somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people died from what became known as “the Spanish flu.” The currently accepted mortality rate for the Spanish flu is between one and three per cent, and its total mortality numbers are shocking in part because of its widespread reach, proliferating throughout country after country around the globe. A familiar name The Spanish flu pandemic was triggered by a virus that is now a household name: H1N1. H1N1 resurfaced in 2009, again spreading to the far reaches of the planet, but with only a small fraction of the death toll of its first emergence. Although it was not an identical virus, it could have been equally deadly in theory, in part because of its potential to kill people who were younger in age and not otherwise considered vulnerable to flu-related mortality. The absolute mortality rate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was 0.001-0.007 per cent. The total number of dead in this case was in the hundreds of thousands around the globe, with a disproportionate number believed to be affected in southeast Asia and Africa. Walter Reed Hospital flu ward during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19, in Washington D.C. (Shutterstock) Why the vast differences in mortality? These two versions of H1N1 did not have the same origin, and there is also an evolutionary push for subsequent versions of the same virus to be less deadly. So the two versions of H1N1 would have been different in these respects. But, importantly, the world was different too. The conditions under which the Spanish flu overtook the world were abhorrent. The First World War had been raging for several years, and the front lines where the illness emerged were places where young soldiers lived among corpses, rats and contaminated water, and had limited opportunities for personal hygiene. In 2009, even the most poor nations of the world had better living conditions than those experienced by the average soldier in the trenches of First World War. Despite this, the nations that had the least ability to provide clean environments for their populations were hit the hardest by the H1N1 infections, with large numbers infected and many fatalities. The spread of COVID-19 in China — and recent cases appearing closer to home — has people worried about another Spanish flu scenario. This will not be another Spanish flu, but we have an important opportunity to control the proliferation of the virus within our own populations. Behaviour and herd immunity Herd immunity is a concept that comes from the field of zoology. It refers to the ability of a population of animals to resist infection by a pathogen — such as a virus — because a sufficiently large number of individuals within the population have humoural immunity on an individual level. Humoural immunity is the ability of the immune system to form antibodies against a specific infectious agent. With herd immunity, transmissibility in a population is dramatically reduced via immunological mechanisms. This is the theory behind vaccines, which boost specific immunity within (ideally) a very large proportion of the population, such that a transmissible disease never gains a foothold. Notice the term “immunological mechanism,” and consider whether the same principle could apply on a behavioural level. An electron microscope image issued by U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 showing the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, the virus that causes COVID-19. (NIAID-RML via AP) As the body’s humoural immune responses deflect infection, so do behaviours that block routes into the body for an infectious agent. With a very large proportion of the population consistently implementing behaviours that reduce transmissibility, epidemics can be prevented or vastly limited, without the reactionary measure of quarantine. Just as humoural immunity does not convey perfect protection to the individual, the same is true for behavioural immunity; it is simply important that a very high proportion of the population is performing precautionary behaviours consistently. Protection is on the level of the herd, more so than on the level of the individual. Are we talking about the wrong things? In the context of this concept of “behavioural herd immunity,” current discussions about COVID-19 in conventional and social media may be focused on the wrong things. Rather than talking about fear-inducing counterfactual scenarios (what ifs), we need to focus on crowdsourcing strategies that limit the ability of the infection to get a foothold in our population. Read more: Coronavirus fears: Should we take a deep breath? A vaccine would be nice and will eventually arrive. But in the meantime, epidemics like COVID-19 can be prevented by increasing the prevalence of precautionary behaviours in the general population that impede its spread. These measures include a few familiar maxims, none of which are implemented consistently enough, and a few unfamiliar ones, which very much need to be taken up individually en masse. And soon. The familiar ones: wash your hands frequently and properly; cover your mouth (with your arm) when coughing or sneezing; avoid close contact with those who are already infected. Before brushing off the above as obvious, we should ask ourselves: do we do these with complete consistency? Can we do better? Consider also the following less obvious but equally important behaviours: Your device screen is a portable petri dish. (Shutterstock) 1. Disinfect your mobile device screen twice per day — it is a portable petri dish, accumulating bacteria and, yes, viruses. Antibacterial wipes are necessary here, as they generally kill viruses as well. Clean your device at least twice daily, once at lunch and once at dinner time (or linked to another daily routine). A recently published study estimates that viruses like COVID-19 may be able to persist for up to nine days on smooth glass and plastic surfaces, like a mobile phone screen. 2. Avoid touching your face. Your mouth, nose, eyes and ears are all routes into your body for viruses, and your fingers are constantly in touch with surfaces that may contain viruses. This simple measure is very hard to maintain consistently, but is essential for infection control. 3. Use masks only if you are yourself ill and give social kudos to people who are responsible enough to use them when sick. 4. Self-quarantine if you are ill and have a fever. 5. Engage your social network to brainstorm other simple behavioural changes. Preventing spread Strengthening herd immunity through behaviour is critical to preventing COVID-19 spread. We need to be talking about it more, and doing it more. In the sea of fear-provoking uncertainties, this is something that we are in control of individually and en masse. Let’s do better about implementing the above precautionary behaviours with high consistency, and over the long-term. And here’s a side benefit: we will be preventing many other infectious illnesses from spreading, including seasonal influenza.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has jumped to over 50,000 a day, and the virus has killed more than 130,000 Americans. Yet, I still hear myths about the infection that has created the worst public health crisis in America in a century. The purveyors of these myths, including politicians who have been soft peddling the impact of the coronavirus, aren’t doing the country any favors. Here are five myths I hear as director of health policy at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center that I would like to put to rest. Myth: COVID-19 is not much worse than the flu President Donald Trump and plenty of pundits predicted early on that COVID-19 would prove no more lethal than a bad flu. Some used that claim to argue that stay-at-home orders and government-imposed lockdowns were un-American and a gross overreaction that would cost more lives than they saved. By the end of June, however, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that national antibody testing indicated 5% to 8% of Americans had already been infected with the virus. With over 130,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths – and that’s likely an undercount – the infection fatality rate is around 0.49% to 0.78% or about four to eight times that of the flu. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who also downplayed COVID-19 as the death toll grew, calling it a “little flu,” announced on July 7 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Myth: Cases are increasing because testing is increasing At one point, the idea that COVID-19 case numbers were high because of an increase in testing made intuitive sense, especially in the early stages of the pandemic when people showing up for tests were overwhelmingly showing symptoms of possible infection. More testing meant health officials were aware of more illnesses that would have otherwise gone under the radar. And testing predominately sick and symptomatic people can result in an overestimate of its virulence. Now, with millions of tests conducted and fewer than 10% coming back positive, the U.S. knows what it is facing. Testing today is essential to finding the people who are infected and getting them isolated. Unfortunately, Trump has been a leading purveyor of the myth that we test too much. Fortunately, his medical advisers disagree. Myth: Lockdowns were unnecessary Given the current spike in infections after reopening the economy, more people are arguing that the lockdowns were unsuccessful in crushing the virus and shouldn’t have been implemented at all. But what would the country look like today if state governments had tried to build herd immunity by letting the disease spread rather than promoting social distancing, prohibiting large gatherings and telling the elderly to stay home? Most epidemiologists who study pandemics believe that reaching herd immunity could only be achieved at enormous cost in terms of illness and death. About 60% or 70% of Americans would have to become infected before the spread of the virus diminished. That would result in 1 to 2 million U.S. deaths and 5 to 10 million hospitalizations. These are horrific, yet conservative estimates, given that mortality rates would surely rise if that many people were infected and hospitals were overrun. Myth: The epidemiological models are always wrong It is not surprising that many people are confused by the proliferation of predictions about the course of the virus. How many people become infected depends on how individuals, governments and institutions respond, which is hard to predict. Faced with the warning early in the pandemic that 1 to 2 million Americans could die if the U.S. simply let the coronavirus run its course, federal and state governments imposed restrictions to constrain the spread of the virus. Then, they relaxed those restrictions as new cases ebbed and pressure mounted to reopen the economy. Now, they must consider reimposing some of those restrictions as infection rates rise in a majority of states, including Texas, Arizona, Florida and California. The models were based on data and assumptions at that time, and likely influenced responses which in turn changed underlying conditions. For example, new cases of COVID-19 are rising in the U.S., while fatalities are falling. This reflects a shift in infection rates toward younger populations, as well as improved treatment as providers learn more about the virus. Just like an investment disclaimer that past returns do not guarantee future performance, modeling a pandemic should be seen as suggestive of what might happen given current information and not a law of nature. Myth: It’s a second wave Sadly, the myth here is that we have contained the virus enough to buy time to prepare for a second wave. In fact, the first wave just keeps getting bigger. A second wave would require a trough in the first wave, but there is little evidence of that from either an epidemiologic or economic perspective. During the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, the weekly UK death toll from influenza and pneumonia, shown here, reflected three clear waves. Taubenberger JK, Morens DM. 1918 Influenza: the Mother of All Pandemics. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006;12(1) The U.S. recorded a record number of new cases during the first week of July, exceeding 50,000 per day for four straight days. The rising number of cases led several states to halt or roll back their reopening plans in hopes of stemming the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, most consumers are reticent to return to “normal” economic activity: Fewer than one-third of adults surveyed by Morning Consult in early July were comfortable going to a shopping mall. Only 35% were comfortable going out to eat, and 18% were comfortable going to the gym. For almost half of the population, an effective treatment or vaccine may be the only way they will feel comfortable returning to “normal” economic activity. COVID-19 is an immediate threat that requires a unified, science-based response from governments and citizens to be successful. But it is also an opportunity to rethink how we prepare for future pandemics. Some misinformation is inevitable as a new virus emerges, but perpetuating myths for political or other reasons ultimately costs lives.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The claim that COVID-19 and its associated medical and social responses do not discriminate belies the history of how pandemics work and who is most impacted by them. States of emergency show that citizenship privileges some, is partial for others and disappears others. In our early analysis of national media coverage, those experts sharing the grim statistics of infections and deaths, those front-line workers seen as risking their lives and those who have lost loved ones are predominantly white. Black, Indigenous and racialized people, and many whose lives have been further imperilled by this pandemic, remain virtually disappeared from the Canadian landscape. That makes collective care for members across our communities untenable. We take pause and reflect on how this will impact Black people across economy, health and policing, to name three areas of concern. Black people tend to be employed in low-paying and highly feminized jobs: these include clerical jobs, janitorial staff, orderlies and nursing assistants who are now determined as essential services. Black people are also more likely to work in the grey and underground economy, which are forms of labour that might involve payments outside the regular labour force and taxation system, and not counted in GDP. Effectively, anti-Black racism has already ensured that Black people and undocumented residents are less than citizens in late modern capitalist Canada. Yet, the people who are likely most at risk are the ones who are being asked to sacrifice their lives. Collectively, Black people in Canada find themselves among the most disadvantaged in all indicators of what is considered a “good life.” Policing the pandemic The attempt to interrupt the spread of the virus has brought together policing and public health. Since at least the post-emancipation period in the Americas — and this period includes Canada — public health and policing have been launched against Black communities. Both public health and policing depend on assessing Black people as wayward. Police in Montréal remind people to keep their social distance as they line up to get into a homeless shelter in late March. Police are being used in cities across Canada to enforce public health rules. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz In the post-emancipation Americas, early public health campaigns sought to “train” Black women on child rearing, cleanliness of homes and food preparation. Indeed, as late as the 1960s, one of the justifications for the destruction of Africville, N.S., was the public health claim that the community was at a health risk as there was no sewage system. Instead of providing necessary services, the community was forcibly removed. Public health has historically been an extension of policing for Black people that has positioned us as suspicious and nefarious in our actions and movements. In our current state of emergency, this union of policing and public health has led to more Black people being arrested, detained and physically restrained in the name of public health protection. The current rules around movement put Black people at risk, more vulnerable to intensified policing (including carding and street checks) when in public and potentially exposed to the virus at work. Disavowing the data On CBC radio’s The Current, Simon Fraser University marketing professor June Francis recapped a conversation she had with a senior federal official in which she raised concerns regarding Black people’s health. Instead of acknowledging this need for data, Francis said the senior federal official told her: “Canada is a colour-blind society and [she] shouldn’t expect that race-based data is necessary.” Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health in Nova Scotia, flanked by Premier Stephen McNeil, left, and Dr. Brendan Carr of the Nova Scotia Health Authority appear at a briefing in Halifax on March 17, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan On April 9, during a public conversation with the Preston Community COVID-19 Response team and African Nova Scotian communities, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer, Robert Strang, said now was not the time to focus on how the social determinants of health and “longstanding issues” are impacting Black communities during this pandemic. He said: “We can focus on these issues later.” On April 10, Ontario’s Chief Medical Health officer, David Williams, said as the province fights to contain the coronavirus, disaggregated race-based data is not necessary. We know differently. The HIV and AIDS responses in Canada show that public health and policing result in criminalization and incarceration for Black people. To ask us to suspend our understanding of these intimate links is to ask us to contend with the possibility of our own demise. Pandemics do discriminate Claims of colour-blind health care and approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic are concerning. The data from elsewhere, including the United States and the United Kingdom, sounds an alarm for Canada. Emerging American data reveal that Black people are contracting the virus at higher rates and also are dying in higher numbers. Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, head of the British Medical Association, called on the U.K. government to urgently investigate why Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to COVID-19. While some provincial public health officers in Canada claim to be concerned about all citizens and committed to everyone’s health, they simultaneously declare that now is not the time to address the social determinants of health nor to begin the collection of disaggregated race-based data. In other words, they refuse to address how racial discrimination negatively impacts the health of Black people. The absence of such plans, however, are indeed evidence of Black people’s partial citizenship and not-yet-quite citizenship. In fact, our health officials must meet these demands for data. Accounting for how the virus impacts Black communities differently would actually demonstrate care. Toronto police officers stop at a red light as they patrol on their service horses in Toronto on April 2, 2020. Health officials and the government have put in place legislation to allow police to ticket, fine and arrest those who aren’t practising social distancing. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette Since the pandemic, we have heard of many Black women and their families in Toronto being evicted and made homeless. We have come to know that many are dealing with increased violence in the narrowly confined spaces they now live in, and are unable to access income support. Despite successful efforts to open health care to all, regardless of immigration status, the Toronto Star reported that some people in Toronto seeking emergency treatment had to pay $500 or risk not being treated. Racism, poverty, incarceration, limited literacy, over-crowded living conditions, lack of social supports and limited access to health services are chronic conditions that must be considered during this pandemic. Black lives are further in peril in a time of COVID-19. Subject to death on both the public health and policing fronts, we will not be silent. Even as state public officials choose to ignore our lives and livability by insisting that race and class do not matter, the historical and contemporary evidence in this country demonstrates more than otherwise.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been at the center of debate in recent weeks over which drugs should be used to treat COVID-19. Neither product has strong evidence to support use for this purpose, and small studies reported to date have either had significant flaws or failed to demonstrate effect. Nonetheless, the president can’t seem to stop pushing them, arguing that patients have nothing to lose. As physicians, bioethicists and drug law experts, we have a responsibility to inject caution here. As public officials and scientists rush to innovate, no one should overlook the critical role of strong regulatory protections in supporting our ability to actually figure out which drugs work against COVID-19. Weakening commitment to science and evidence during this crisis truly would be “a cure worse” than the disease. The FDA is on the lookout for fraudulent products that claim to cure COVID-19. Getty Images / Al Drago / CQ Roll Call FDA’s emergency use authorization There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, and no product has strong data to support its use against this disease. Nonetheless, on March 28, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the strategic national stockpile by various pharmaceutical companies. The EUA was granted exclusively to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), allowing it to distribute these stockpiled drugs to local public health authorities for the unapproved use of treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients unable to participate in clinical trials. An EUA is not the same as the FDA’s traditional marketing approval. To be approved under normal rules, drugs must be shown safe and effective for their intended use. An EUA, in contrast, is a temporary authorization granted in the face of a public health emergency, based only on a determination that a product “may” be effective and that its likely benefits outweigh its likely risks. This EUA was supported only by “limited in-vitro and anecdotal clinical data in case series” – with no acknowledgment of contrary data or significant safety concerns. Overall, it’s sown even further confusion about the promise and uncertainties of these drugs. Off-label use An EUA is not the only way that COVID-19 patients may access hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. A physician is generally free to prescribe approved drugs for unapproved uses as part of their authority to practice medicine. This is referred to as “off-label” use. Because several hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine products have been FDA-approved for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, they’re eligible for off-label use against COVID-19. Following President Trump’s comments that these drugs could be a potential “game changer,” attention and prescriptions sky-rocketed, despite caution from experts. Some physicians stockpiled the drugs for personal use, and several hospitals have adopted hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 standard of care. Although there have been efforts to help protect supply for those patients needing the drug for their proven indications, some of these patients have been told they may have to go without. It is too soon to say whether chloroquine products work for COVID-19, since the few clinical studies are small and lack randomization or carefully matched control groups. Severe side effects have caused some hospitals to stop using them altogether. There is a great need for rigorously conducted clinical trials on these products and their possible effectiveness in fighting COVID-19. But if physicians continue prescribing them off-label, without regard for appropriate testing, we’ll be left with anecdotes, not evidence. A box of hydroxychloroquine, marketed under the name of Plaquenil, in a Paris pharmacy. Getty Images / Chesnot Expanded access to new drugs There are other drugs with some potential to combat COVID-19, but that have not yet been approved for any use and therefore may not be prescribed off-label. These drugs are currently under investigation in clinical trials around the U.S. and the globe. For seriously ill patients, the FDA has a pathway known as “expanded access” (sometimes called “compassionate use”) by which patients may be dosed with unapproved drugs for treatment use, if they are unable to enroll in a clinical trial. This eligibility restriction is critical because it ensures that patients cannot secure access by opting out of the trials designed to produce the evidence needed to confidently assess a product’s safety and efficacy. Drug maker Gilead has emphasized this approach with its investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. Even as it opens its expanded access program through a wider pathway, the company has explained that participation in clinical trials will be the primary mode of patient access. Focus on science Pragmatism is needed to collect data in real time, as patients are also in desperate need of treatment. That’s precisely the approach taken by the World Health Organization in its mega trial of four potential treatments for COVID-19, including remdesivir and chloroquine products, with over 70 countries participating. The trial is aptly named SOLIDARITY, and it is designed to minimize the burden on physicians and patients, while allowing random assignment and collection of systematic, anonymous data. We simply have to stop guessing about what’s going to work for patients battling COVID-19. Patients today and tomorrow need a commitment from politicians, policymakers, companies and physicians to prioritize science and rigorous study. Off-label use and expanded access may be reasonable options for patients when there is no clinical trial available, but if there is, we have to prioritize enrollment. The FDA has demonstrated its willingness to help speed trials and facilitate the collection of data. But its regulatory standards must not be short-circuited and its flexibility must be used judiciously. Federal policy in this area should be driven by scientific expertise, not false hope, hunches or short-sighted political demands. [Get facts about coronavirus and the latest research.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work. The big idea We found that schools can reopen for in-person instruction without further spreading COVID-19 in nearby communities if the number of people with the disease is relatively low. But if there are more than 21 cases per 100,000 people, COVID-19 spread may increase. To reach this conclusion, we used data from September through December 2020 in Michigan and Washington states – both of which allowed districts to decide whether or not to offer in-person schooling at that time – to analyze how these different instructional decisions affect COVID-19 case rates. It’s hard to figure this out because other factors, such as social distancing and the use of masks, could be to blame. So it might appear that going to school in person makes COVID-19 spread, but really it is due to safety habits – or the lack thereof – especially if those same communities are more likely to send students back to school in person. We tried to address this concern by including information in our statistical analyses on such practices as mask-wearing in a community and how a county voted in 2016. Political preference was an important factor to consider, because Republicans appear less likely than Democrats to comply with COVID-19 safety measures. Republicans are also more likely to encourage in-person instruction during the pandemic. Despite our findings, coronavirus very likely does transmit in schools to some degree. But the spread of COVID-19 there may simply reflect what’s going on in the surrounding community. Kids and educators may be just as safe in school buildings – or possibly even safer – than they would be elsewhere. Why it matters Most districts closed the doors of their school buildings in March and did not reopen them for the remainder of the school year, instead offering students remote instruction. But evidence is growing that remote instruction isn’t working well, especially for low-income students and students of color. Given these challenges, many districts chose to offer in-person or hybrid instruction last fall. But as the number of COVID-19 cases rises, districts like Chicago’s and others are facing the difficult decision of whether to open schools – or to keep them open. To date there has been little data to guide them. Our study provides some of the first U.S.-based evidence to policymakers as they make these difficult choices. What still isn’t known While we provide specific estimates of when COVID-19 rates are high enough that the virus will likely spread as a result of opening schools, they should be treated with caution because statistical estimates are subject to error. The takeaway is not to focus on specific thresholds but rather to understand that levels exist at which in-person schooling contributes to community spread. Moreover, how schools open and the safety measures they take are likely to play a role in terms of what happens with COVID-19 cases. Schools can, for example, bring back only some students, require masks and keep desks spaced several feet apart from one another. These practices probably reduce transmission of the disease. However, we are not able to assess how much these steps might help because we do not have information on safety protocols in individual schools or whether schools are following those protocols. What other research is being done So far, while there are some studies on how COVID-19 has affected learning, especially how the pandemic may be disproportionately harming the education of low-income and minority students, there is not much research about how the disease is spreading in U.S. schools. One study found associations between school closures in the spring of 2020 and reductions in COVID-19 deaths. However, other social distancing policies were enacted at the same time, making the contribution of schools unclear. A new study found results similar to ours when examining hospitalizations – that in-person instruction was associated with more nearby hospitalizations when existing COVID-19 rates were high, but that there was no such correlation when rates were low.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 has not only upended our personal lives, it has dramatically changed scientific research. In response to the rapid spread of the virus, scientists around the world have had to find new ways to collaborate and solve problems, all at speeds previously thought unimaginable. Indeed, until very recently, the idea that a new vaccine could be developed, tested and distributed in less than a year would have seemed impossible. The rapid pace at which science is moving is exciting. In addition to producing vaccines, scientists have found ways to prevent the virus from spreading, dispel pandemic myths and identify communities most at risk of falling ill. But the “warp speed” at which science is moving can also be dangerous, especially when inconclusive or unverified research studies gain public attention. As researchers studying science and health communication, our team has been paying close attention to the way one form of preliminary research — the preprint — makes its way to audiences. What are preprints? Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are posted online but haven’t been formally verified by the scientific community. Scientists use them for many reasons, from getting early feedback on new work to sharing findings that are important but may never make it into a journal. Preprints can also help make research more accessible because they are free to read, while many journal articles are not. They can also be published by scientists without any delays, as opposed to the many months (or even years) it takes for a study to go through peer review and be published in a journal. For some findings, waiting for a paper to pass through two or three independent researchers — or academic peers — who read the study and assess its rigour, originality and significance, is a manageable delay. But for others — like those about promising new drugs, prevention strategies or medical therapies — speed can make a big difference. In these cases, posting a preprint means that other scientists can start working on replicating the results right away, potentially allowing new treatments or vaccines to be approved months or even years ahead of schedule. This speed advantage is one reason that preprint use has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. When almost 800,000 people worldwide are falling ill every week, faster science isn’t just about convenience: It’s about saving lives. A 2019 panel presentation at Johns Hopkins University on the role of preprints in scholarly research. Preprints in the COVID-19 pandemic While preprints have an obvious advantage for scientists, things can get tricky when these preliminary studies make their way outside of the scientific community. Early in the pandemic, for example, two high profile preprints linking tobacco and COVID-19 prevention started to receive a lot of media coverage. Although the studies turned out to be highly flawed, many readers took the findings to heart, sparking unnecessary panic and encouraging smoking. The tentative nature of preprints is one reason journalists have historically been discouraged from reporting on them. But with the onset of the pandemic, and few relevant peer-reviewed studies to draw on, journalists were left with little choice but to cover these preliminary reports. Indeed, in the early months of the pandemic, COVID-19-related preprints were more than 200 times as likely to receive media coverage than preprints on other topics, according to a study posted (as a preprint) last year. In our peer-reviewed study, we found that, unfortunately, the preliminary nature of these studies wasn’t always communicated consistently. Of the more than 450 media stories we analyzed, only about half accurately portrayed preprints as being uncertain or unverified research. Surprisingly, it wasn’t just the newer, less traditional media outlets that failed to identify the research as preprints. Even established publications like the New York Times did not always describe the preprints they covered as preliminary. Staying critical and informed as science evolves While this coverage of preprints isn’t in and of itself a bad thing, it can be dangerous if the tentative nature of the science isn’t made transparent. Luckily, journalism associations are starting to develop recommendations for covering preprints responsibly. Preprint servers, or online collections, like bioRxiv and medRxiv, have also started posting “warning” messages alongside new studies to remind readers not to treat the findings as established facts. Until these best practices become commonplace, however, it’s up to all of us to develop the skills we need to make responsible and well-founded decisions about our health. Learn to read science papers critically, remember to fact check questionable claims, and, most importantly, always think before you share. As science communicator Liz Neeley so aptly put it, “We are all science communicators now: COVID-19 has conscripted us.” Preprints may be here to stay, but if we learn to communicate responsibly about this preliminary research, the confusion they generate doesn’t have to be.

View all partners Languages Français English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Amid the carnage of the First World War, a flu epidemic took hold in the front-line trenches and subsequently spread around the world, infecting one-quarter of the world’s total population and ultimately killing more people than the war itself. Before it was over, somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people died from what became known as “the Spanish flu.” The currently accepted mortality rate for the Spanish flu is between one and three per cent, and its total mortality numbers are shocking in part because of its widespread reach, proliferating throughout country after country around the globe. A familiar name The Spanish flu pandemic was triggered by a virus that is now a household name: H1N1. H1N1 resurfaced in 2009, again spreading to the far reaches of the planet, but with only a small fraction of the death toll of its first emergence. Although it was not an identical virus, it could have been equally deadly in theory, in part because of its potential to kill people who were younger in age and not otherwise considered vulnerable to flu-related mortality. The absolute mortality rate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was 0.001-0.007 per cent. The total number of dead in this case was in the hundreds of thousands around the globe, with a disproportionate number believed to be affected in southeast Asia and Africa. Walter Reed Hospital flu ward during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19, in Washington D.C. (Shutterstock) Why the vast differences in mortality? These two versions of H1N1 did not have the same origin, and there is also an evolutionary push for subsequent versions of the same virus to be less deadly. So the two versions of H1N1 would have been different in these respects. But, importantly, the world was different too. The conditions under which the Spanish flu overtook the world were abhorrent. The First World War had been raging for several years, and the front lines where the illness emerged were places where young soldiers lived among corpses, rats and contaminated water, and had limited opportunities for personal hygiene. In 2009, even the most poor nations of the world had better living conditions than those experienced by the average soldier in the trenches of First World War. Despite this, the nations that had the least ability to provide clean environments for their populations were hit the hardest by the H1N1 infections, with large numbers infected and many fatalities. The spread of COVID-19 in China — and recent cases appearing closer to home — has people worried about another Spanish flu scenario. This will not be another Spanish flu, but we have an important opportunity to control the proliferation of the virus within our own populations. Behaviour and herd immunity Herd immunity is a concept that comes from the field of zoology. It refers to the ability of a population of animals to resist infection by a pathogen — such as a virus — because a sufficiently large number of individuals within the population have humoural immunity on an individual level. Humoural immunity is the ability of the immune system to form antibodies against a specific infectious agent. With herd immunity, transmissibility in a population is dramatically reduced via immunological mechanisms. This is the theory behind vaccines, which boost specific immunity within (ideally) a very large proportion of the population, such that a transmissible disease never gains a foothold. Notice the term “immunological mechanism,” and consider whether the same principle could apply on a behavioural level. An electron microscope image issued by U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 showing the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, the virus that causes COVID-19. (NIAID-RML via AP) As the body’s humoural immune responses deflect infection, so do behaviours that block routes into the body for an infectious agent. With a very large proportion of the population consistently implementing behaviours that reduce transmissibility, epidemics can be prevented or vastly limited, without the reactionary measure of quarantine. Just as humoural immunity does not convey perfect protection to the individual, the same is true for behavioural immunity; it is simply important that a very high proportion of the population is performing precautionary behaviours consistently. Protection is on the level of the herd, more so than on the level of the individual. Are we talking about the wrong things? In the context of this concept of “behavioural herd immunity,” current discussions about COVID-19 in conventional and social media may be focused on the wrong things. Rather than talking about fear-inducing counterfactual scenarios (what ifs), we need to focus on crowdsourcing strategies that limit the ability of the infection to get a foothold in our population. Read more: Coronavirus fears: Should we take a deep breath? A vaccine would be nice and will eventually arrive. But in the meantime, epidemics like COVID-19 can be prevented by increasing the prevalence of precautionary behaviours in the general population that impede its spread. These measures include a few familiar maxims, none of which are implemented consistently enough, and a few unfamiliar ones, which very much need to be taken up individually en masse. And soon. The familiar ones: wash your hands frequently and properly; cover your mouth (with your arm) when coughing or sneezing; avoid close contact with those who are already infected. Before brushing off the above as obvious, we should ask ourselves: do we do these with complete consistency? Can we do better? Consider also the following less obvious but equally important behaviours: Your device screen is a portable petri dish. (Shutterstock) 1. Disinfect your mobile device screen twice per day — it is a portable petri dish, accumulating bacteria and, yes, viruses. Antibacterial wipes are necessary here, as they generally kill viruses as well. Clean your device at least twice daily, once at lunch and once at dinner time (or linked to another daily routine). A recently published study estimates that viruses like COVID-19 may be able to persist for up to nine days on smooth glass and plastic surfaces, like a mobile phone screen. 2. Avoid touching your face. Your mouth, nose, eyes and ears are all routes into your body for viruses, and your fingers are constantly in touch with surfaces that may contain viruses. This simple measure is very hard to maintain consistently, but is essential for infection control. 3. Use masks only if you are yourself ill and give social kudos to people who are responsible enough to use them when sick. 4. Self-quarantine if you are ill and have a fever. 5. Engage your social network to brainstorm other simple behavioural changes. Preventing spread Strengthening herd immunity through behaviour is critical to preventing COVID-19 spread. We need to be talking about it more, and doing it more. In the sea of fear-provoking uncertainties, this is something that we are in control of individually and en masse. Let’s do better about implementing the above precautionary behaviours with high consistency, and over the long-term. And here’s a side benefit: we will be preventing many other infectious illnesses from spreading, including seasonal influenza.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has jumped to over 50,000 a day, and the virus has killed more than 130,000 Americans. Yet, I still hear myths about the infection that has created the worst public health crisis in America in a century. The purveyors of these myths, including politicians who have been soft peddling the impact of the coronavirus, aren’t doing the country any favors. Here are five myths I hear as director of health policy at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center that I would like to put to rest. Myth: COVID-19 is not much worse than the flu President Donald Trump and plenty of pundits predicted early on that COVID-19 would prove no more lethal than a bad flu. Some used that claim to argue that stay-at-home orders and government-imposed lockdowns were un-American and a gross overreaction that would cost more lives than they saved. By the end of June, however, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that national antibody testing indicated 5% to 8% of Americans had already been infected with the virus. With over 130,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths – and that’s likely an undercount – the infection fatality rate is around 0.49% to 0.78% or about four to eight times that of the flu. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who also downplayed COVID-19 as the death toll grew, calling it a “little flu,” announced on July 7 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Myth: Cases are increasing because testing is increasing At one point, the idea that COVID-19 case numbers were high because of an increase in testing made intuitive sense, especially in the early stages of the pandemic when people showing up for tests were overwhelmingly showing symptoms of possible infection. More testing meant health officials were aware of more illnesses that would have otherwise gone under the radar. And testing predominately sick and symptomatic people can result in an overestimate of its virulence. Now, with millions of tests conducted and fewer than 10% coming back positive, the U.S. knows what it is facing. Testing today is essential to finding the people who are infected and getting them isolated. Unfortunately, Trump has been a leading purveyor of the myth that we test too much. Fortunately, his medical advisers disagree. Myth: Lockdowns were unnecessary Given the current spike in infections after reopening the economy, more people are arguing that the lockdowns were unsuccessful in crushing the virus and shouldn’t have been implemented at all. But what would the country look like today if state governments had tried to build herd immunity by letting the disease spread rather than promoting social distancing, prohibiting large gatherings and telling the elderly to stay home? Most epidemiologists who study pandemics believe that reaching herd immunity could only be achieved at enormous cost in terms of illness and death. About 60% or 70% of Americans would have to become infected before the spread of the virus diminished. That would result in 1 to 2 million U.S. deaths and 5 to 10 million hospitalizations. These are horrific, yet conservative estimates, given that mortality rates would surely rise if that many people were infected and hospitals were overrun. Myth: The epidemiological models are always wrong It is not surprising that many people are confused by the proliferation of predictions about the course of the virus. How many people become infected depends on how individuals, governments and institutions respond, which is hard to predict. Faced with the warning early in the pandemic that 1 to 2 million Americans could die if the U.S. simply let the coronavirus run its course, federal and state governments imposed restrictions to constrain the spread of the virus. Then, they relaxed those restrictions as new cases ebbed and pressure mounted to reopen the economy. Now, they must consider reimposing some of those restrictions as infection rates rise in a majority of states, including Texas, Arizona, Florida and California. The models were based on data and assumptions at that time, and likely influenced responses which in turn changed underlying conditions. For example, new cases of COVID-19 are rising in the U.S., while fatalities are falling. This reflects a shift in infection rates toward younger populations, as well as improved treatment as providers learn more about the virus. Just like an investment disclaimer that past returns do not guarantee future performance, modeling a pandemic should be seen as suggestive of what might happen given current information and not a law of nature. Myth: It’s a second wave Sadly, the myth here is that we have contained the virus enough to buy time to prepare for a second wave. In fact, the first wave just keeps getting bigger. A second wave would require a trough in the first wave, but there is little evidence of that from either an epidemiologic or economic perspective. During the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, the weekly UK death toll from influenza and pneumonia, shown here, reflected three clear waves. Taubenberger JK, Morens DM. 1918 Influenza: the Mother of All Pandemics. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006;12(1) The U.S. recorded a record number of new cases during the first week of July, exceeding 50,000 per day for four straight days. The rising number of cases led several states to halt or roll back their reopening plans in hopes of stemming the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, most consumers are reticent to return to “normal” economic activity: Fewer than one-third of adults surveyed by Morning Consult in early July were comfortable going to a shopping mall. Only 35% were comfortable going out to eat, and 18% were comfortable going to the gym. For almost half of the population, an effective treatment or vaccine may be the only way they will feel comfortable returning to “normal” economic activity. COVID-19 is an immediate threat that requires a unified, science-based response from governments and citizens to be successful. But it is also an opportunity to rethink how we prepare for future pandemics. Some misinformation is inevitable as a new virus emerges, but perpetuating myths for political or other reasons ultimately costs lives. This article has been updated to clarify that fatality rate data is infection fatality rate.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The claim that COVID-19 and its associated medical and social responses do not discriminate belies the history of how pandemics work and who is most impacted by them. States of emergency show that citizenship privileges some, is partial for others and disappears others. In our early analysis of national media coverage, those experts sharing the grim statistics of infections and deaths, those front-line workers seen as risking their lives and those who have lost loved ones are predominantly white. Black, Indigenous and racialized people, and many whose lives have been further imperilled by this pandemic, remain virtually disappeared from the Canadian landscape. That makes collective care for members across our communities untenable. We take pause and reflect on how this will impact Black people across economy, health and policing, to name three areas of concern. Black people tend to be employed in low-paying and highly feminized jobs: these include clerical jobs, janitorial staff, orderlies and nursing assistants who are now determined as essential services. Black people are also more likely to work in the grey and underground economy, which are forms of labour that might involve payments outside the regular labour force and taxation system, and not counted in GDP. Effectively, anti-Black racism has already ensured that Black people and undocumented residents are less than citizens in late modern capitalist Canada. Yet, the people who are likely most at risk are the ones who are being asked to sacrifice their lives. Collectively, Black people in Canada find themselves among the most disadvantaged in all indicators of what is considered a “good life.” Policing the pandemic The attempt to interrupt the spread of the virus has brought together policing and public health. Since at least the post-emancipation period in the Americas — and this period includes Canada — public health and policing have been launched against Black communities. Both public health and policing depend on assessing Black people as wayward. Police in Montréal remind people to keep their social distance as they line up to get into a homeless shelter in late March. Police are being used in cities across Canada to enforce public health rules. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz In the post-emancipation Americas, early public health campaigns sought to “train” Black women on child rearing, cleanliness of homes and food preparation. Indeed, as late as the 1960s, one of the justifications for the destruction of Africville, N.S., was the public health claim that the community was at a health risk as there was no sewage system. Instead of providing necessary services, the community was forcibly removed. Public health has historically been an extension of policing for Black people that has positioned us as suspicious and nefarious in our actions and movements. In our current state of emergency, this union of policing and public health has led to more Black people being arrested, detained and physically restrained in the name of public health protection. The current rules around movement put Black people at risk, more vulnerable to intensified policing (including carding and street checks) when in public and potentially exposed to the virus at work. Disavowing the data On CBC radio’s The Current, Simon Fraser University marketing professor June Francis recapped a conversation she had with a senior federal official in which she raised concerns regarding Black people’s health. Instead of acknowledging this need for data, Francis said the senior federal official told her: “Canada is a colour-blind society and [she] shouldn’t expect that race-based data is necessary.” Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health in Nova Scotia, flanked by Premier Stephen McNeil, left, and Dr. Brendan Carr of the Nova Scotia Health Authority appear at a briefing in Halifax on March 17, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan On April 9, during a public conversation with the Preston Community COVID-19 Response team and African Nova Scotian communities, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer, Robert Strang, said now was not the time to focus on how the social determinants of health and “longstanding issues” are impacting Black communities during this pandemic. He said: “We can focus on these issues later.” On April 10, Ontario’s Chief Medical Health officer, David Williams, said as the province fights to contain the coronavirus, disaggregated race-based data is not necessary. We know differently. The HIV and AIDS responses in Canada show that public health and policing result in criminalization and incarceration for Black people. To ask us to suspend our understanding of these intimate links is to ask us to contend with the possibility of our own demise. Pandemics do discriminate Claims of colour-blind health care and approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic are concerning. The data from elsewhere, including the United States and the United Kingdom, sounds an alarm for Canada. Emerging American data reveal that Black people are contracting the virus at higher rates and also are dying in higher numbers. Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, head of the British Medical Association, called on the U.K. government to urgently investigate why Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to COVID-19. While some provincial public health officers in Canada claim to be concerned about all citizens and committed to everyone’s health, they simultaneously declare that now is not the time to address the social determinants of health nor to begin the collection of disaggregated race-based data. In other words, they refuse to address how racial discrimination negatively impacts the health of Black people. The absence of such plans, however, are indeed evidence of Black people’s partial citizenship and not-yet-quite citizenship. In fact, our health officials must meet these demands for data. Accounting for how the virus impacts Black communities differently would actually demonstrate care. Toronto police officers stop at a red light as they patrol on their service horses in Toronto on April 2, 2020. Health officials and the government have put in place legislation to allow police to ticket, fine and arrest those who aren’t practising social distancing. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette Since the pandemic, we have heard of many Black women and their families in Toronto being evicted and made homeless. We have come to know that many are dealing with increased violence in the narrowly confined spaces they now live in, and are unable to access income support. Despite successful efforts to open health care to all, regardless of immigration status, the Toronto Star reported that some people in Toronto seeking emergency treatment had to pay $500 or risk not being treated. Racism, poverty, incarceration, limited literacy, over-crowded living conditions, lack of social supports and limited access to health services are chronic conditions that must be considered during this pandemic. Black lives are further in peril in a time of COVID-19. Subject to death on both the public health and policing fronts, we will not be silent. Even as state public officials choose to ignore our lives and livability by insisting that race and class do not matter, the historical and contemporary evidence in this country demonstrates more than otherwise.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been at the center of debate in recent weeks over which drugs should be used to treat COVID-19. Neither product has strong evidence to support use for this purpose, and small studies reported to date have either had significant flaws or failed to demonstrate effect. Nonetheless, the president can’t seem to stop pushing them, arguing that patients have nothing to lose. As physicians, bioethicists and drug law experts, we have a responsibility to inject caution here. As public officials and scientists rush to innovate, no one should overlook the critical role of strong regulatory protections in supporting our ability to actually figure out which drugs work against COVID-19. Weakening commitment to science and evidence during this crisis truly would be “a cure worse” than the disease. The FDA is on the lookout for fraudulent products that claim to cure COVID-19. Getty Images / Al Drago / CQ Roll Call FDA’s emergency use authorization There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, and no product has strong data to support its use against this disease. Nonetheless, on March 28, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the strategic national stockpile by various pharmaceutical companies. The EUA was granted exclusively to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), allowing it to distribute these stockpiled drugs to local public health authorities for the unapproved use of treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients unable to participate in clinical trials. An EUA is not the same as the FDA’s traditional marketing approval. To be approved under normal rules, drugs must be shown safe and effective for their intended use. An EUA, in contrast, is a temporary authorization granted in the face of a public health emergency, based only on a determination that a product “may” be effective and that its likely benefits outweigh its likely risks. This EUA was supported only by “limited in-vitro and anecdotal clinical data in case series” – with no acknowledgment of contrary data or significant safety concerns. Overall, it’s sown even further confusion about the promise and uncertainties of these drugs. Off-label use An EUA is not the only way that COVID-19 patients may access hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. A physician is generally free to prescribe approved drugs for unapproved uses as part of their authority to practice medicine. This is referred to as “off-label” use. Because several hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine products have been FDA-approved for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, they’re eligible for off-label use against COVID-19. Following President Trump’s comments that these drugs could be a potential “game changer,” attention and prescriptions sky-rocketed, despite caution from experts. Some physicians stockpiled the drugs for personal use, and several hospitals have adopted hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 standard of care. Although there have been efforts to help protect supply for those patients needing the drug for their proven indications, some of these patients have been told they may have to go without. It is too soon to say whether chloroquine products work for COVID-19, since the few clinical studies are small and lack randomization or carefully matched control groups. Severe side effects have caused some hospitals to stop using them altogether. There is a great need for rigorously conducted clinical trials on these products and their possible effectiveness in fighting COVID-19. But if physicians continue prescribing them off-label, without regard for appropriate testing, we’ll be left with anecdotes, not evidence. A box of hydroxychloroquine, marketed under the name of Plaquenil, in a Paris pharmacy. Getty Images / Chesnot Expanded access to new drugs There are other drugs with some potential to combat COVID-19, but that have not yet been approved for any use and therefore may not be prescribed off-label. These drugs are currently under investigation in clinical trials around the U.S. and the globe. For seriously ill patients, the FDA has a pathway known as “expanded access” (sometimes called “compassionate use”) by which patients may be dosed with unapproved drugs for treatment use, if they are unable to enroll in a clinical trial. This eligibility restriction is critical because it ensures that patients cannot secure access by opting out of the trials designed to produce the evidence needed to confidently assess a product’s safety and efficacy. Drug maker Gilead has emphasized this approach with its investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. Even as it opens its expanded access program through a wider pathway, the company has explained that participation in clinical trials will be the primary mode of patient access. Focus on science Pragmatism is needed to collect data in real time, as patients are also in desperate need of treatment. That’s precisely the approach taken by the World Health Organization in its mega trial of four potential treatments for COVID-19, including remdesivir and chloroquine products, with over 70 countries participating. The trial is aptly named SOLIDARITY, and it is designed to minimize the burden on physicians and patients, while allowing random assignment and collection of systematic, anonymous data. We simply have to stop guessing about what’s going to work for patients battling COVID-19. Patients today and tomorrow need a commitment from politicians, policymakers, companies and physicians to prioritize science and rigorous study. Off-label use and expanded access may be reasonable options for patients when there is no clinical trial available, but if there is, we have to prioritize enrollment. The FDA has demonstrated its willingness to help speed trials and facilitate the collection of data. But its regulatory standards must not be short-circuited and its flexibility must be used judiciously. Federal policy in this area should be driven by scientific expertise, not false hope, hunches or short-sighted political demands. [Get facts about coronavirus and the latest research.

But socialization is an important part of growing up. As much as COVID-19 has affected adults, it may affect children and teens even more. How to explain to a young child why he cannot play with other children? How can children learn to read facial expressions when people wear masks? How to see friends, how to date and form new relationships with social distancing and schools mostly online? Such experiences are so vital to teenage and young adult development. This new angst is now added to the plethora of mental health issues already affecting young people. Though experts suspect there has been an uptick in suicide in the pandemic, 2020 statistics are not in yet. How common is teenage suicide? Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents. Each year in Canada, there are more than 200 young lives lost due to suicide. Many parents wonder what they should know about teen suicide and what they can do to prevent it. With a better understanding of suicide, and with teenagers spending more time at home, we believe that parents can engage in an honest and safe conversation about suicide with their kids. ‘The Suicide Crisis Line: An Education in Listening’ with crisis line volunteer Dylan Gunaratne | TEDxCalStateLA. What parents should know about teen suicide Every life lost to suicide is one too many. When someone dies by suicide, people closest to the deceased are severely aggrieved, and members of the community, such as students and teachers at school are afflicted as well. For each suicide, many more teens think about suicide or attempt suicide. Our research shows that before age 21, about 22 per cent of adolescents claim to have thought about it, 10 per cent have had serious thoughts and seven per cent have attempted suicide. While the probability of death remains low, the likelihood of ideation (considering or wanting to end one’s own life) or attempts is common. There is an important sex and gender gap in deaths by suicide: about two or three boys to one girl. However, girls are more prone to attempt suicide. Why are suicide rates higher in boys? First, boys often use more violent means, making medical intervention difficult. Second, traditional gender roles (“boys are strong”) may encourage the hiding of innermost thoughts and discourage help-seeking. But the gap is closing. Suicide rates are on the rise in girls and young women in Canada. Why do adolescents attempt to take their own lives? This haunting question has no clear answers. Suicide is a complex phenomenon, with biological, psychological and social interactions. The ‘It Gets Better’ project inspires people globally to share stories to remind the next generation of LGBTQ+ youth that hope is out there. (Shutterstock) Suicidal thoughts and behaviours are closely tied to mental disorders ranging from major depression, anxious disorder, conduct disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and alcohol or substance abuse. Certain personality traits, such as borderline personality, can also increase suicide risk. We also know that suicide rates are higher in Indigenous youth and in youth identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning (LGBTQ+). ‘Tomorrow’s Hope,’ A First Nations youth suicide prevention motion comic from the Government of Alberta. Many experts point to increased use of social media and to cyberbullying as factors fuelling the mental health crisis. About 15 per cent of adolescents report having been cyberbullied at least once in any given year. With the COVID-19 crisis and more time spent online, the risks of excessive screen time, loneliness and cyberbullying could have increased, with associated adverse social and mental health effects. ‘It Gets Better’ project video. What parents can do to prevent suicide Suicidal ideation often signals psychological distress. Thus, suicidal ideation should always be taken seriously. A recent study in the United States showed that 50 per cent of parents were not aware that their adolescents, especially younger adolescents, were thinking about suicide. For this reason, it’s important to be there, and be aware. Be especially attentive to warning signs. Don’t wait for teens to come to you. Engage them in conversation. Be alert for any signs of psychological suffering, non-suicidal self-injury, social isolation, increased drug/alcohol use or researching the internet for potential means. Any step toward exploring suicide or signs of considering a suicide attempt should be considered a red flag. How to respond The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention recommends that concerned parents ask the question directly. For instance, a parent might ask: “I am concerned because I’ve noticed that you have been acting differently lately. Some teens undergoing a difficult time can have dark thoughts or even suicidal thoughts: Is it happening with you?” Asking the question about suicide will show you care. It will not increase suicidal thoughts or put ideas into your child’s head. The most powerful parental response is to validate your teen’s feelings. To validate does not mean to agree, but to genuinely recognize and accept feelings, thoughts and behaviours. However, a teen may not feel like sharing or expressing loneliness. When communication is difficult, tell your teen you’re available. Ensure they have someone to confide in. Validation can be challenging. Parents are encouraged to seek professional help for themselves and to consult self-help books on validation. Seek help early Most adolescents who transition from ideation to attempt will do it within the first year. Seek help early. Among teens who attempted suicide, about half will make another attempt during the course of adolescence. For some, the risk continues into adulthood. The risk of dying by suicide is highest for those who attempt more than once. Restricted access to means, such as locking down medication, is an important prevention strategy. It’s important to know that providing adequate social support and professional mental health care can change outlooks on life. While suicide might appear as a solution to a suffering teenager, it never is. Recovery is always possible. Teenagers with suicidal ideation need to be reminded it’s never too late to build a life worth living. Read more: Some students in the class of 2020 may face traumatic loss due to coronavirus. Here's how to help. While initial interventions should focus on safety, long-term treatment seeks to build protective factors, such as self-acceptance, supportive relationships and commitment to positive life goals. In this time of recovery stories of advocates who have survived suicide ideation or attempts and moved beyond surviving to thriving can be an important source of hope. ‘From suicidal to hopeful, how I learnt to fight,’ TEDxAuckland talk with Jazz Thornton. Available resources for parents and teens Determining suicidal risk is complex, even for the most experienced mental health professional. There is no blood test or brain scan to predict with precision who will make an attempt or who will die by suicide. We recommend that, according to level of need, parents who are worried call helplines, contact their adolescent’s therapist or take their teen to the hospital emergency department (ER). A visit to the ER may be appropriate when the risk is acute or imminent. Mental health services are available privately or through public institutions like schools and health clinics. Treatments such as dialectical behavioural therapy, or cognitive behavioural therapy when parents are involved, have been effective in reducing suicide risk in vulnerable teens. While you are not expected to know exactly what to do or say if your teen has suicidal thoughts, you can certainly be a valuable source of support. Parents and teens are not alone. If your life or someone else’s is in danger, call 911 for emergency services. For support, reach Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868, or text CONNECT to 686868.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As governments around the world debate the conditions for reopening schools, some regions have mandated that teachers wear masks when school resumes. Concerns have been expressed about loss of learning opportunities for linguistically diverse students and for children who read lips. For kindergarten and primary teachers, teaching younger children while masked also presents challenges — specifically related to students’ social-emotional learning. Non-verbal cues carry up to 55 per cent of the emotional content of messages. Without those cues, a lot of important information is missed. With masks mandatory in schools, it is imperative to look for solutions that mitigate the negative social, relational and physical effects on students and teachers. (Pixabay) Furthermore, the mouth and eyes are even more important than other facial features when interpreting expression. In contrast to adults who get most non-verbal social information from speakers’ eyes, young children pay most attention to speakers’ mouths. This elevates the challenge of clearly communicating emotions to children while wearing a mask. Read more: How to prevent teacher burnout during the coronavirus pandemic Research has shown the “ability to encode, interpret and organize emotional and social information are skills needed to both engage in learning, and to develop self- and social awareness and make responsible decisions.” These social-emotional skills are recognized as critical developmental skills in early childhood. Clear communication of emotions There is broad consensus between experts that positive relationships are more likely to develop when people communicate clearly, feel understood and can understand others’ feelings in safe environments. Positive student-teacher relationships result in greater pro-social behaviour, school engagement and academic success in students, and lower levels of burnout in teachers. Teachers experience additional risks The potential emotional and social losses for both students and teachers presented by masking are further exacerbated by potential physical injury to teachers. Vocal strain is a significant occupational hazard in teaching, and the increased volume necessary to be understood when wearing a mask may contribute to this risk. Wearing masks is now recommended in schools in Canada and the United States, for example, so it is imperative to look for solutions that mitigate the negative social, relational and physical effects on students and teachers. Teachers can learn from strategies developed by masked pediatric nurses to meet the shared teaching/nursing goals of expressing care, communicating clearly and promoting trusting relationships that foster a sense of safety. Pediatric nurses have developed strategies for effective communication with children while wearing masks. (Shutterstock) Amplify verbal and visual cues to expression and meaning. Masked teachers can provide enhanced verbal and non-verbal cues when communicating with students by using exaggerated nodding, emphasizing eyebrow movement to enhance expression and frequently checking to ensure that students understand. Moreover, teachers can intentionally replace the smile behind the mask by intensifying statements of connection and encouragement, winks and other signs of emotion. Teach children to watch for “happy crinkles.” In addition to exaggerating expression, teaching children to use cues outside of those provided by mouths can help them interpret emotions and meaning. Focus young children’s attention on the “happy crinkles” that appear around the outer corners of eyes when adults smile. Experts recommend playing masked “guess the emotion” games as a fun way to cue children to identify emotions displayed by others, a strategy Laura used successfully as a child life therapist. Consider the materials used to construct the masks. Some nurses have responded to the pandemic by using masks sewn from colourful and whimsical materials to create less clinical visual settings for children. Furthermore, psychologists have suggested the use of clear masks order to ensure children continue to have access to the social and emotional information garnered from observing speakers’ mouths. Keep people, rather than roles, front and centre. Nurses during the pandemic use two strategies to ensure that their identities as individuals are accessible to patients. One strategy is wearing photos of themselves unmasked and smiling outside of their protective equipment. In this way, pediatric patients can see them as individual people rather than as generic medical personnel. As a pediatric nurse, Ellen also finds it helpful to smile unmasked at pediatric patients through the window of their hospital room doors before masking and entering the room. Use a microphone and rest your voice. Our final recommendation addresses the risk of voice strain exacerbated by the use of masks while teaching. Using a wireless microphone not only increases the volume while demanding no more than typical voice effort by teachers, but it also allows teachers to move freely while teaching. Moreover, alternating teacher-led and student-led work will provide rest periods for teachers’ voices, as well as allow for the differentiated instruction associated with improved student outcomes. Many of the challenges teachers will face in classrooms will mirror the challenges of mask-wearing nurses who provide care to pediatric patients. Nurses can be a source of practical solutions for these barriers, based on their clinical practices. The strategies presented here can enhance the learning experiences of young students in the new world of COVID-19 aware classrooms.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As of Feb. 5, Canada had administered 2.7 COVID-19 vaccination doses per 100 people compared to 61.7 for Israel and 16.2 for the United Kingdom. By contrast, Canada has signed contracts with seven different companies for a total of 234 million doses with options for tens of millions more. What’s going on? To understand the problem, we need to go back to the 1980s. At that time, the government-owned Connaught Labs was producing vaccines here in Canada and decision-making was in the public realm. But Connaught was partially privatized and then finally allowed to be sold to the French company Merieux (now part of Sanofi) by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. Fast forward to the 2000s, when Québec-based vaccine manufacturer IAF BioChem went through a couple of sales and ended up being owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Sanofi and GSK still make vaccines in Toronto and Ste-Foy, but decisions about what vaccines to produce are not in Canadian hands. Unheeded warnings Dr. David Naylor, then Dean of Medicine at the University of Toronto, is seen in Halifax in September 2003 at the Annual Conference of Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers of Health discussing his report on a Canadian centralized centre for disease control. (CP PHOTO/Scott Dunlop) It didn’t have to be that way. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the report Learning from SARS led by Dr. David Naylor recommended that Canada develop a “national vaccine strategy” and prioritize the security of our vaccine supply. We got another warning about the need for a secure and steady supply of vaccines with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 when there were production delays at the GSK plant in Ste-Foy. Nobody seems to have been paying attention. As a result, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, Canada was left with few options. COVID-19 response Canada’s first attempt to ensure domestic production was a deal with the Chinese manufacturer CanSino Biologics in May 2020. Had that deal gone ahead, it would have involved trials at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University and, if successful, subsequent domestic manufacturing. But within days of the agreement being announced, there were already troubles as the Chinese delayed sending the seed material for the vaccine and, ultimately, it never arrived. Efforts to secure a domestically made supply then turned to upgrading the National Research Council (NRC) facility in Montréal and subsequently building an entirely new plant at a total cost of $170 million. In doing so, the government bypassed providing PnuVax, a biopharmaceutical company also located in Montréal, with any of the $600 million from Industry Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund earmarked for the research or development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. PnuVax had been renovated in 2012 to meet Health Canada standards and according to sources cited by the Globe and Mail, the company could have been ready to produce millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2020. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, with scientists Anja Rodenbrock, centre, and Stephane Lanthier during a visit to the National Research Council’s Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre facility in Montréal on Aug. 31, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially said the NRC facility would be up and running by November 2020 and producing 250,000 doses a month. However, in early February, Trudeau admitted that the NRC plant wouldn’t be ready until the summer of 2021, and with the need to outfit the facility for the Novavax vaccine and subsequent Health Canada inspections, there won’t be any vaccine coming from there until the end of 2021. The failure of the CanSino deal and the delay in building the new NRC facility left Canada reliant on foreign sources of vaccine. The contracts for the vaccine were negotiated based on advice provided by the 18 member COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force set up by the NRC in June 2020. Both the co-chairs of the task force have conflicts of interest with companies producing the vaccines and the terms of the contracts are being kept secret. Among other things, we don’t know what price Canada is paying for each vaccine, what the timeline for delivery is, whether there are penalties for delays and how the contracts are being enforced, if at all. Complicating things even further, the contracts focused on large-scale delivery starting in April 2021 because of uncertainty back in the summer about when vaccines would be available. Delayed deliveries Now Canada is facing delays in vaccine delivery from both Pfizer and Moderna, the companies making the only two vaccines approved in Canada so far. The Pfizer plant in Belgium, where our vaccine comes from, is being retooled to increase production while the exact reasons for the Moderna delay are unclear. Moderna is shipping its vaccine to Canada through Belgium. (Both companies and the federal government have promised that the amounts scheduled for delivery by the end of March will be honoured.) Toronto’s Mass Vaccination Clinic is shown on Jan. 17, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn On top of having no domestic production and the delays, Canada is facing vaccine nationalism from other countries. U.S. President Joe Biden is sticking to an America-first position and not allowing the Pfizer plant in Michigan or the Moderna plant in New Hampshire to export any of their vaccines to Canada until all Americans have been vaccinated. The European Union is also threatening to block the export of vaccines possibly affecting exports from Belgium, as it too is confronting delays in being able to vaccinate its citizens. One response from Canada to all of this is to claim 1.9 million doses of the yet-to-be-approved AstraZeneca vaccine from COVAX, a facility primarily set up to ensure that low- and middle-income countries will have access to vaccines. Canada is the second-largest country donor to COVAX and is entitled to claim vaccines from COVAX, but is doing so when, as of Feb. 3, only four African countries have started vaccinating their citizens. In an interview on CBC’s As It Happens, Karina Gould, Canada’s minister of international development, defended Canada’s move, a made-in-Canada form of vaccine nationalism. Ensuring that Canadians would receive an effective vaccine quickly was never going to be a sure thing; there was always plenty of opportunity for something to go wrong. But the uncertainty involved has been compounded by a lack of government planning in the past, secrecy, a lack of international co-operation and poor government decision-making. Let’s hope we do better when the next pandemic comes around.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As major oil and gas producers and exporters, Norway and Canada share a particular responsibility for confronting the planet’s existential climate threat. However, their different political, economic and cultural features have resulted in major differences in their climate policy track records. Overall, Norway is a leader on climate change performance and Canada is a laggard. The 2021 Climate Change Performance Index ranks 61 countries on their progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, renewable energies and climate policy. Norway ranked eighth overall, while Canada was near the bottom in 58th place. Both countries face epic challenges in weaning themselves from petroleum dependence — and putting an end to exporting carbon emissions. Canada is a long way from winding down the oil and gas industry and implementing a green and inclusive recovery. One of the advantages Norway holds is the high degree of equality and inclusivity in the policy process, which translates into a healthier democracy than Canada’s. This is something Canada can learn from and improve upon. Our way or the Norway Canada produces 4.7 million barrels of oil per day — 80 per cent of it from Alberta — and exports 79 per cent to the United States. The carbon emissions from the consumption of those fossil fuel exports are almost four times greater than the emissions produced in their extraction and processing. These emissions aren’t attributed to Canada, even though it’s responsible for making them available. Norway produces 1.7 million barrels of oil daily and, since the country runs mainly on hydroelectricity, exports almost all of it, largely to Western Europe. Norway exports 10 times more emissions than it produces domestically. Norway’s exit ramp from oil dependence is bumpy. Despite some contradictory climate actions, Norway’s progress exceeds that of virtually all petro-states, with Canada trailing behind. Norway has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-55 per cent compared to 1990s levels by 2030, largely through domestic actions. Norway is the world leader in electric vehicle sales; by 2025, all new cars sold will be zero-emission vehicles. Only 3.3 per cent of passenger vehicles sold in Canada during the first half of 2020 were electric. A satirical GM Super Bowl commercial recognizes Norway’s leadership in electric vehicle sales. Norway participates in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, the world’s largest carbon market, and has spent billions on international offsets in developing countries through its REDD+ program to maintain and expand their forests as carbon sinks. Canada recently introduced legislation to meet or exceed a 30 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 compared to 2005, in part by boosting its carbon tax, but continues to heavily subsidize fossil fuel production. Since early 2020, Canada has allocated US$14.6 billion to support fossil fuel energy and an equivalent amount on clean energy. Norway also spends a lot on its fossil fuel industry — at least US$11.76 billion since 2020. And with an economy that runs largely on renewable energy, it allocated only US$382 million to renewables. The good, the bad and the ugly Neither Canada nor Norway has achieved absolute emissions reductions. Industry in both countries downplays this reality, choosing to focus instead on their progress in reducing carbon intensity — emissions per barrel of oil. Neither country has committed to a production endgame either. Denmark is the first major oil-producing country to commit to terminating state-approved oil exploration in the North Sea and ending all oil extraction by 2050. Climate change performance index (2021). The first three positions are blank because no country scores high enough. Canada is ranked among the worst performing countries and fell three spots in 2021. (Germanwatch 2020) Canadian carbon emissions increased 20.9 per cent between 1990 and 2018, mostly driven in turn by a five-fold expansion of oilsands emissions. Canada’s energy regulator predicts oil production overall will grow 41 per cent from 2018 to 2040. Norway’s emissions increased three per cent between 1990 and 2018, and it continues to sell oil leases for offshore drilling including in the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea. Canada has imposed a moratorium on Arctic offshore drilling. Divergent paths Canada and Norway’s paths to carbon zero have, for the most part, diverged, with Canada falling behind badly. In Norway, the state-controlled company, Equinor, and the government jointly determine climate policy. In Canada, petroleum corporations have more leverage on climate policy because they control their production and investment decisions at home and abroad, and are accountable only to their shareholders. Norway is a unitary state giving the government uncontested jurisdictional authority over climate policy. As a federal state with divided jurisdictions, the Canadian federal government is in a much weaker policy-making position. There is a high degree of political stability on climate action in Norway. Even the right-wing Progress Party acknowledges the climate threat and supports the government’s climate plan. In Canada, wide swings on climate policy over the past 40 years have thwarted sustained advances. While a majority of Canadians now support decisive action on climate change, there are splits along party lines and geography, with most Conservative provincial governments opposing a carbon tax. In Canada, especially under Conservative governments, there has been very little consultation with labour unions and NGOs on climate policy, whereas in Norway these consultations are viewed as essential in shaping policy, regardless of the government in power. Additionally, Norway’s lower levels of economic inequality and stronger social safety net reinforce its robust democracy. Alberta squandered its oil wealth on low provincial taxes and corporate giveaways. The province created the Alberta Heritage Fund in the 1970s, but it currently contains only US$12 billion. Norway on the other hand, created a sovereign wealth fund in 1996 to retain the bulk of economic rent from the oil and gas extraction. The fund now holds US$1.3 trillion in global investments, which facilitates its climate transition. The fund’s return on these investments in 2019 was US$180 billion, and in 2020 it sold the last of its money-losing investments in foreign fossil fuel companies. The Norwegian government is still highly dependent on the petroleum sector, but fiscal rules allow it to draw up to four per cent annually from the sovereign wealth fund returns if net petroleum transfers fall short of spending requirements. Political leadership is crucial There is plenty of room for Canada to increase taxes on the wealthy and corporations. It can also strengthen its public investment banks and expand the Bank of Canada’s “quantitative easing” efforts, namely holding government-issued debt to provide the necessary resources for an equitable and sustainable transition. Read more: The throne speech must blaze a bold new path — including imposing a wealth tax Governing the decentralized Canadian federation is complex. This puts more weight on political leadership in all parties, in all regions, to acknowledge the truth about the climate crisis and build the necessary consensus to meet the challenge. Political leadership is the art of persuasion: learning from the past, building coalitions, taking bold action. As a major carbon emitter, Canada must fulfil its global responsibility in helping to stop this runaway train. Denial, delay and division are no longer an option.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Imagine this: You notice a problem that might be disastrous for your company’s reputation, or you have an idea that can save thousands of dollars. You want to say something but you’re not sure if you should. You’re afraid it might not go over well and not sure it will make a difference. You want to speak up, but you’re uncertain about how to voice your ideas in such a way that people will actually listen. You’re not alone. Studies consistently show that employees are reluctant to speak up, and are even hardwired to remain silent, with 50 per cent of employees keeping quiet at work. Why is this the case, and how can we help people voice their opinions at work more effectively? Speak up or zip it? Employee voice — speaking up with ideas, concerns, opinions or information — is vital for organizational performance and innovation. On the flip side, silence is at the root of many well-known organizational disasters. For example, Canada’s Phoenix pay system debacle, which has already cost the federal government $1.5 billion, was attributed to a culture that “does not reward those who share negative news.” Employees who sounded alarms were told they weren’t being “team players.” Employee voice is the antidote to this culture of silence, but it’s not easy to encourage. Employees withhold voice because they think it will not be heard or fear it may backfire by embarrassing their managers or damaging their own reputations. These reservations are reasonable. Although speaking up is generally linked with positive career outcomes, it can lead to lower social status at the office and lessened performance ratings in some circumstances. Employees’ proactive personalities and managers’ demonstrated openness are both relevant to overcoming these reservations. Although we can’t change someone’s personality, leaders can create more welcoming environments that support and encourage voice. Encouraging workers to voice opinions For example, employees are more likely to speak up when they believe their leader encourages and solicits their opinions. By contrast, when leaders punish employees who dare to speak up with concerns or ideas, such as by publicly reprimanding them, voice dwindles quickly. Pointing out others’ mistakes or sharing ideas that go against common practice can “rock the boat.” So how can employees still find ways to speak up effectively and have their ideas actually heard, despite these risks? Be sure to do your research and prepare before sharing your opinions for improvement at work. (Mika Baumeister/Unsplash) Our research sought to answer this question by focusing on the quality of the messages that employees express. We first unpacked the meaning of what we call high-quality voice, uncovering the key ways that employees can improve their messages to gain greater recognition. We investigated these ideas with five studies involving nearly 1,500 participants. We identified four critical features of employee voice attempts that make them higher-quality: They have a strong rationale. Their ideas and opinions are logical and based on evidence. Employees should do their homework first and build a compelling case for their ideas by showing they’ve put a lot of thought into them. They shouldn’t speak up if they haven’t gathered information or reflected on the reason behind implementing their ideas first. They have a high feasibility. Their ideas are practical and have the potential to be implemented. Employees should consider whether their organizations can realistically take action on their suggestions, such as by accounting for time or resource constraints and offering details on how to enact them. Employees shouldn’t ignore the realities and difficulties leaders face in actually doing something with their ideas and concerns. They have a strong organizational focus. Their opinions are critical to the success of the organization or team, not just personally beneficial to the employee. Workers should emphasize the collective benefits of their voice and link it with the organization’s visions, mission, and/or goals, such as by explaining how it will help the organization overall. They shouldn’t focus on issues that only affect themselves, otherwise it comes across as self-interested. They have a high novelty. Employees are innovative and account for new perspectives or viewpoints. They should consider whether their organization has tried (or considered) this idea before and clarify what makes it particularly unique, such as by contrasting it from typical conventions or opinions. They shouldn’t just repeat old ideas or approach the situation with the same frame of mind. Voice quality tips. (Author), Author provided Putting effort into better ‘voicing’ Putting energy into developing higher-quality voice messages takes effort, but our research shows that it pays off. Employees who regularly presented higher-quality voice were regarded as more worthy of promotion and better all-round performers in their jobs. Why don’t employees speak up? Often it’s because managers don’t encourage it. Healthy, happy workplaces encourage workers to voice their opinions. (You X Ventures/Unsplash) These positive outcomes were evaluated from both peers and managers. And these findings held up regardless of how often employees spoke up, whether the evaluator liked them or viewed them as competent. Basically, speaking up with higher-quality messages predicted job performance and promotability above and beyond all of these other factors. So is there a downside to speaking up? Yes, if you don’t put the time and energy into making your input high-quality. When people spoke up often with low-quality ideas, their peers reported that they were worse performers and less promotable. So speaking up can backfire if employees consume all of the airtime by frequently expressing low-quality ideas that offer little help to anyone. The lesson? It’s worthwhile to speak up and share your ideas and concerns — and it may help your career — but if you do so, ensure that you do your homework first, reflect on the feasibility of implementation, connect the benefits to the organization and/or its employees and consider what makes it particularly novel. How leaders can help What can organizational leaders do to help employees voice their opinions more effectively? When asking for input, prompt with some questions. For example: What is the logic for this idea and is there evidence to support it? How might we actually implement it and overcome barriers? How does this fit within the organization’s priorities and/or help other employees? What is new about this idea that we haven’t tried before? These questions can produce higher quality ideas that will benefit employees, leaders and organizations alike. Ultimately, increasing the quality of employee feedback and opinions will help them be heard. It will also result in ideas that are more likely to be implemented and improve work conditions and performance for the entire organization.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Archeological evidence from Peru has revealed that some ancient big-game hunters were, in fact, women, challenging what science writer James Gorman wrote was “one of the most widely held tenets about ancient hunters and gatherers — that males hunted and females gathered.” “Man the Hunter” is a narrative of human origins developed by early 20th-century anthropologists armed with their imaginations and a handful of fossils. They viewed hunting — done by men — as the prime driver of human evolution, bestowing upon our early ancestors bipedalism, big brains, tools and a lust for violence. In this narrative, hunting also gave rise to the nuclear family, as women waited at home for men to bring home the meat. A France24 report on the Peru findings. As an anthropologist who studies hunting and gathering societies, I was thrilled by the discovery of female skeletons buried with big-game hunting paraphernalia, a pattern that raises important questions about ancient gender roles. But I found most of the media coverage it generated disappointingly inaccurate. Responding to the finding, journalist Annalee Newitz wrote: “Nicknamed ‘man the hunter,’ this is the notion that men and women in ancient societies had strictly defined roles: Men hunted, and women gathered. Now, this theory may be crumbling.” In fact, that theory died a well-deserved death decades ago. Hunting origins In 1966, 75 anthropologists (70 of whom were men) held a symposium called “Man the Hunter” at the University of Chicago to address one of humanity’s grand questions: How did people live before agriculture? The researchers had lived with and studied contemporary populations of hunting and gathering peoples around the world, from jungle to tundra. It was there in Chicago that real-life data confronted the myth of Man the Hunter. Researchers showed that women worked just as hard as men, and plant foods gathered by women were crucially important in hunter-gatherer diets. Hunter-gatherer movement patterns were driven by a variety of ecological factors, not just game. And many hunter-gatherers were quite peaceful and egalitarian. Hunting wasn’t the sole driver or unifying theory of human evolution after all. By the late 1970s, as anthropologists carried out further research on hunter-gatherers and paid attention to issues of gender, the myth of Man the Hunter fell into disfavour. Updating beliefs Even so, subsequent research has affirmed a simple division of labour among hunter-gatherers: men mostly hunt and women mostly gather. When anthropologist Carol Ember surveyed 179 societies, she found only 13 in which women participated in hunting. But it is a mistake to conflate this pattern of “most hunters are men” among hunter-gatherers with the myth of Man the Hunter. That myth was born of assumptions, not careful empirical research. Through decades of field research, anthropologists have developed a more flexible and capacious view of human labour. According to this view, women are not bound by biology to gather, nor men to hunt. In fact, several accounts of women’s hunting in foraging societies had emerged by the mid-1980s. In this context, ancient female hunters are an expectation, not a surprise. And the focus on Man the Hunter distracts from the more important question of how a society with female big-game hunters might be constructed. After all, women are perfectly capable of hunting, yet in most hunter-gatherer societies they don’t do it very often. Hunting and child care One prominent explanation, elaborated in 1970 by feminist anthropologist Judith Brown, is that the demands of hunting conflict with the provision of child care. This was supported in a recent review of women’s hunting that surveyed traditional societies around the world; the authors found that pregnant or lactating women do not often hunt, and those with dependents only hunt when child care is available or rich hunting grounds are close to camp. These constraints play a role in shaping risk preferences. In hunter-gatherers, men’s hunting is risky, meaning it carries a high chance of failure. Men tend to hunt alone or in small groups and target big game with projectile weapons, which often requires fast-paced, long-distance travel. In contrast, women prefer to hunt in groups and focus on smaller, easier-to-capture prey closer to camps, often with the aid of dogs. Women are often crucial to the hunting success of others, whether through logistical or ritual assistance. Husbands and wives sometimes work collaboratively; in these instances women may help trap an animal, then club it to death and carry the meat home. And in big-game hunting societies, women provide support to hunters by manufacturing clothing, weaponry and transportation equipment. They may also participate in hunting directly by locating, then surrounding and driving game toward a killing location, as seen among high-latitude reindeer hunters and Plains bison hunters. As the authors of the new paper speculate, this is likely how the Peruvian female hunters killed game. Updated views on plant gathering provide insight into why women may choose not to hunt altogether. No one questioned that hunting is hard, but early anthropologists often assumed women’s gathering was simple and easy. This turns out to be wrong. Like hunting, gathering demands extensive ecological knowledge and skill that is socially learned and cultivated over a lifetime. As a result, hunter-gatherers face tough choices about how to divide difficult labor in a 24-hour day. In this context, economic considerations show that it pays to specialize: modest comparative advantages — speed and strength, and the incompatibilities posed by child care — can lead to divisions of labour that increase overall food acquisition by the group. From this perspective, women’s decisions to hunt less than men may be a rational decision about allocating effort. The Batek people Many have assumed that by not hunting, women are relegated to lower status. But is that true? I conduct my work among the Batek people, hunter-gatherers from the rainforests of Malaysia who are widely considered one of the most gender-egalitarian societies in the world. They have little material inequality, share food widely, abhor violence and emphasize individual autonomy. When day breaks at camp, Batek men trek far, usually alone, to hunt monkeys with blowpipes. The women gather tubers or fruit in small groups closer to camp. Nothing prohibits women from hunting, as is the case with some hunter-gatherers where, for example, touching hunting weapons is forbidden. Batek women sometimes join in group hunts of bamboo rats, but it is otherwise rare. However, there are exceptions. Some teenage girls establish an interest in blowpipe hunting that carries into adulthood. The Batek people say this division of labour comes down to strength differences, incompatibility with child care and differences in knowledge specialization. Hunting has great cultural significance, but women’s knowledge of plant distributions is crucial for collective decisions like moving camp. The Batek conceive of themselves as a co-operative and interdependent group in which each person makes a unique and important contribution toward a communal goal. Girls from the hunting and gathering Batek tribe playing with blowpipes. (Kirk Endicott), Author provided Beyond Man the Hunter Contrary to news reports, the archeological findings from Peru accord well with current knowledge about how and why men and women divide labour among hunter-gatherers. And it has little to do with the myth of Man the Hunter. The Peruvian hunter-gatherers were big-game specialists who used spear-throwing technologies that were likely relatively easy to learn. This may have enabled more flexible divisions of labour and broader participation in hunting by women, similar to what we see among some hunter-gatherers today. The social implications beyond these facts are not clear. That’s because one’s role in food collection has no simple relation to status or power dynamics. New research on neglected topics like the determinants of women’s status and risk-seeking economic behaviour in traditional societies promises to shed light on this issue. But as the case with the Batek people shows, among a liberated society of equals, status and power has little to do with who brings in the meat.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger At the end of 2020, Canada quietly reached a milestone: our first-ever gender-equal house of Parliament, the Senate. Sen. Frances Lankin noted in December that there were 47 women and 47 men in the Senate. The balance shifted back in favour of men following the retirement of Lynn Beyak and the death of Elaine McCoy. But given the Senate’s institutional structure, the high number of women legislators generally allows for a strong representation of women’s interests in the upper house — which is why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should make strides to return it to gender parity with his next Senate appointments. In December 2020, Canada was tied with Australia for the second-highest percentage of women legislators in the upper house (with the Caribbean’s Antigua and Barbuda taking the top spot). In 2019, women made up only 24 per cent of legislators globally. Recently, the Canadian House of Commons reached 100 women MPs for the first time, amounting to 30 per cent female representation. Prime ministers have long used Senate appointments to make up for the lack of diversity in the House of Commons. The Senate was initially created, in fact, to protect the interests of minority regions. More recently, though, it’s become a chamber where the interests of marginalized groups are protected. Sen. Lynn Beyak waits for the speech from the throne to be read in the Senate in December 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Senators generally speak up for marginalized groups by introducing legislation that protects their interests, and by scrutinizing and amending government legislation. That certainly isn’t always the case — Beyak retired from the Senate earlier this year amid a controversy over her remarks about Indigenous people and residential schools. But it was other senators, including Murray Sinclair and Mary Jane McCallum, who pushed for the departure of the Stephen Harper appointee. Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was introduced in 1982, Canadians have come to see themselves as belonging to groups that stretch across provincial borders. We tend to identify with each other based on our gender, ethnicity and language, and there have been growing calls for our politicians to better represent us in that regard. The significance of women in the Senate But why should we care about the gender of our legislators? Don’t we need people best equipped to do the job? In 1995, political theorist Anne Phillips wrote about “the politics of presence.” She maintains that there is a difference in the lived experiences of men and women, and the representation provided by individuals is influenced by their experiences. Newly appointed Sen. Rosemary Moodie (centre) poses for a photograph with Sen. Ratna Omidvar and Sen. Peter Harder outside the Senate Chamber in February 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand In studies of representation, diversity is increasingly seen as beneficial for the policy-making process. Women senators bring unique viewpoints to the table that will shape legislation and policy in Canada. Gender cannot be the only reason a woman is chosen, but being a woman should not be a barrier due to outdated masculine selection criteria. Researchers continue to investigate whether women legislators truly represent and look out for women in politics. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the representation of women’s interests is not only about the number of women in a legislature, but also about the presence of legislators who will work to represent women’s policy preferences. Female politicians are more likely to be the legislators who act on behalf of women, which makes it all the more important that the Senate reaches gender parity again soon. Men can certainly represent women’s interests, but empirical evidence shows that they usually don’t take up women’s causes on their own initiative. However, research has shown that male legislators’ advocacy of women’s issues increases as the number of women in legislatures grows. That means that as more women join the Canadian Senate, there will be more opportunities for them to work together as well as collaborating with like-minded male colleagues to advance women’s interests. Senators have defied government wishes There’s also hope that senators are in a better position to represent women’s interests than elected legislators in the House of Commons. Evidence from around the world supports the theory that party discipline hinders the promotion and representation of women’s interests. Newly appointed Sen. Patricia Duncan (centre) poses for a photograph with Sen. Raynell Andreychuk and Sen. Peter Harder outside the Senate Chamber in Ottawa in February 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand But party discipline is relatively weak in the Canadian Senate. Senators are appointed, and they don’t have to toe the party line to ensure re-election. More than half of Canadian senators don’t belong to a national party caucus. That means that in most cases, senators are not subject to party discipline at all. Therefore, they have the freedom to act for other groups seeking representation, including women, and in a non-partisan manner. We’ve already seen examples of senators thwarting the government’s wishes to protect women’s interests. Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservative government’s Bill C-43 advanced anti-choice abortion policy in Canada. Famously, the bill died in the Senate after a tie vote in 1991, when multiple Progressive Conservative senators, including three women, voted against the bill. More recently, in 2017, senators pushed to eliminate sex discrimination in the Indian Act, amending Bill S-3 to do so. While the initial amendment was rejected by the government, senators’ efforts led it to reconsider its policy and ultimately include their changes. There is already some evidence of heightened feminist activity in the Canadian Senate as the number of women senators rises. Through interviews with senators in 2019, I unearthed a network of feminist legislators forming among newly appointed women senators. Given the important role played by women senators, it’s imperative that gender parity in the Senate is restored. Trudeau’s next Senate appointments will be ones to watch. It will be increasingly important to look for indicators that our senators are representing otherwise marginalized groups.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As emergency shelters and encampments emerge in cities across North America, the public has been confronted with a more visible homeless population as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this has led to several crusades aimed to — once again — hide this population from view. I research public responses to homelessness, and I believe that we can do better. Through education and dialogue, we can begin to recognize that we all want the same thing: the end of homelessness, safer neighbourhoods and adequate housing for all. With several years of experience involved in coalition work alongside Ontario’s street-involved population, my doctoral research examines processes of mourning as ways to mobilize public understanding and togetherness. Homelessness need not be viewed as an inevitable part of the fabric of North American society. It was not always omnipresent, and need not continue to be. It has only really become pervasive, and increasing since the 1980s in Canada. Research has argued that it is preventable. Policies produce homelessness Today’s housing crisis is a result of particular policies that are neither inevitable nor intractable. Yet, perhaps most unfortunately, the collective response has too often included blaming, criminalizing and stigmatizing people experiencing homelessness. No longer can we covertly warehouse working-class people experiencing any mixture of bad luck, addictions, mental health challenges and trauma produced by historical oppressions that are difficult to define. The spread of COVID-19 through the shelter system is well-documented, though it took a lawsuit for the City of Toronto to take action. And still, several Canadian cities threaten the evictions of the most vulnerable from encampments. Read more: Cities must end homeless camp evictions during the coronavirus pandemic Various communities made up of outreach workers, nurses and artists — such as the Encampment Support Network in Toronto — meet the material needs that city governments refuse to address. Meanwhile, “dehoused” citizens are shipped off to holding cells in hotels, shelters, community centres and empty apartment buildings, where many already struggling with mental illness or drug addictions are isolated and separated from essential harm reduction services. The results have been disastrous. This homeless camp at Strathcona Park in Vancouver, B.C., developed after city officials shut down the homeless encampment at Oppenheimer Park in late 2020 in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Hope in coalitions What is now emerging is the way in which certain affluent communities have veered toward age-old practices of NIMBYism, fear-mongering and unequal policing. Of course, this is a complex issue. In a talk she gave at the West Coast Women’s Festival in 1981, social justice activist Bernice Johnson Reagon declared: “We’ve pretty much come to the end of a time when you can have a space that is ‘yours only’ — just for the people you want to be there.” Reagon, a lifelong civil rights activist and feminist, wrote and spoke about the desperate need to engage in coalition work, reminding her audience that coalition work “is not work done in your home. Coalition work has to be done in the streets.” Medical sociologist Arthur Frank suggests a conceptual persona he calls the dialogical stoic that combines the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius with the dialogical responsibilities adhered to by the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin. Stoicism is that ability each of us has to choose the best option amid what is sometimes a panoply of difficult circumstances. Frank explains the steadfast commitment to dialogue as a discovery of the suffering of the other, while existing “on the boundary with others.” Frank emphasizes, importantly, Bakhtin’s claim that people are unfinalizable — thus, there is no “last word.” There is no “these types of people.” Collisions open up opportunities for coalitions. Will we seek to discover the other — their stories, their pain, their gifts — as, like always, we have the choice to do so? Or will we band together with those only like us? Will we stay home or take to the streets? ‘Feel the strain’ There has been some thoughtful writing about the teachable moments offered by the pandemic. Students returning to schools certainly have much to digest and teachers have a great deal of material to draw from as they resume in-person classes. But what if we began to consider the teachable moments offered to all of us, even as these opportunities present themselves in public spaces? Cultural critic Henry Giroux describes this as public pedagogy, arguing that classroom learning needs to spill out into “social movements in the streets.” These are certainly uncomfortable moments.

View all partners Languages Bahasa Indonesia English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Remote working is becoming more popular than ever. A study released by the Swiss office provider IWG found that 70% of professionals work remotely at least one day a week, while 53% work remotely for at least half of the week. Some multinationals have their entire staff working remotely, with no fixed office presence at all, which can result in having employees situated all over the world. New technology makes all this possible. While there are certainly benefits, there are also a number of pitfalls. As remote working becomes the new normal for many, it’s important companies adapt and put the right policies in place to ensure their employees feel part of the team and don’t burn out. Nearly 70% of millennials would be more likely to choose an employer who offered remote working according to one study. The benefits are important. Employees value the flexibility it gives them, particularly if they have childcare commitments. People also appreciate escaping long commutes and avoiding office distractions. But there are also growing concerns that people’s mental health and well-being can take a hit when working remotely. In the UK, businesses lose £100m every year due to workplace stress, depression and anxiety. Research shows that being “always on” and accessible by technology while working remotely leads to the blurring of work and non-work boundaries, particularly if you work from home. A 2017 United Nations report found that 41% of remote workers reported high stress levels, compared to just 25% of office workers. Out of sight, out of mind? One of the reasons for this could be the “out of sight, out of mind” mentality that’s commonplace toward remote workers, which leads to a lack of trust, feelings of being an outsider and a tendency for people to think their colleagues are talking negatively about them behind their back. One study of 1,100 workers found that the 52% who worked from home at least some of the time were more likely to feel left out and mistreated, as well as unable to deal with conflict between themselves and colleagues. Navigating sensitive territory in a virtual team is an essential skill. If we’re not careful, issues can fester. Emails can be misinterpreted as being rude or too direct. And, with no visible body language it is tricky to convey our true meanings. Remote working can bring a pressure to be always online. Shutterstock In a virtual environment there is a tendency to focus too much on tasks and too little on relationships. This kind of transactional leadership can be the route taken by leaders who want to get the job done but fail to recognise how important the people are who are completing these tasks. With more emphasis on deadlines and routine information, virtual workers can feel treated as a cog in a machine, rather than an essential part of the team. Such a leadership approach can worsen the sense of isolation that naturally comes with working remotely and can contribute to virtual workplace stress. Good stress, bad stress As part of my research, I’ve spoken to university colleagues and students who work virtually. Feelings of isolation, loneliness and being unable to “switch off”, as well as the lack of social support, were all mentioned. One of the more significant issues raised was that of how virtual working was managed. Interviewees said a lack of feedback from line managers and senior colleagues gave them no benchmark to judge progress, which led to increased feelings of anxiety and a concern as to whether they were “up to standard”. When it comes to work, there are two kinds of stress – the good kind and the bad kind. The Yerkes-Dodson Law (drawn up by psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson) points out that stress can be productive up to a point and then it results in reduced productivity. Being unable to report being stressed (or being uncomfortable doing so), is detrimental as pressure will eventually outweigh an individual’s ability to cope over time. In contrast, one recent study found that colleagues who spend just 15 minutes socialising and sharing their feelings of stress had a 20% increase in performance. The right kind of communication is key to overcoming the trials and tribulations of virtual working. Employers need to put the right structures in place such as scheduled video calls and regular team-building meetups to build rapport. Bosses need to lead by example and create a culture where those outside the office feel valued. But it cuts both ways. Everyone needs to think about what makes them productive, happy and successful in everyday life, and try to replicate this in a remote setting – whether this ranges from taking a walk at lunch time, going to the gym, ringing a friend or reading your favourite book. If the future of work is heading towards more virtual working, then it is not something we can avoid. Instead we should implement ways of managing the stress associated with it, while enjoying the benefits. Work Employment Management Flexible working Workplace ethics Remote working Want to write?

Sam Wordley via Shutterstock Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In this episode of The Conversation Weekly, four experts dissect the impact a year of working from home has had on employees and the companies they work for – and what a more hybrid future might look like. And we talk to a researcher who asked people to sit in bathtubs full of ice-cold water to find out why some of us are able to stand the cold better than others. For many people who can do their job from home, the pandemic meant a sudden shift from office-based to remote working. But after a year of working from home, some company bosses really don’t want it to become the new normal. The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, called it an “aberration”, and Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it wasn’t sustainable, because of how hard it is to maintain culture and collaboration with teams working remotely. Meanwhile, others are fully embracing a remote work future. Twitter said its employees could work from home forever, and Spotify announced a “work from anywhere” policy. Other firms are starting to announce more hybrid policies, where people are expected to split their week between the home and the office: in March, BP told employees they would be expected to work from home two days a week. In this episode, we talk to researchers who have been studying the shift to remote working during the pandemic about their findings. In France, Marie-Colombe Afota, assistant professor in leadership, IÉSEG School of Management in France, talks us through the initial results of a new study she did in late 2020 of 4,000 employees at a large French multinational. “The more employees felt that the organisation generally values being visible in the office, the more they felt expected to be constantly available while in remote work,” says Afota. “And, in turn, two months later, the less they felt productive and happy in remote work.” A year of working from home has left some people close to burnout, according to Dave Cook, a PhD researcher in anthropology at University College London who has been interviewing people about their experiences of shifting to remote work during the pandemic. “Burnout and work-life balance is the forgotten public health emergency that’s emerging through throughout this lockdown,” he tells us. And he says that companies should start communicating with their staff now about what the future has in store: “So their employees can get on with planning the rest of their lives.” For others, the shift to remote work has been a surprisingly good experience. Jean-Nicolas Reyt, an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal, has been tracking the language that chief executives in North America used to talk about remote working in 2020. “What you see is that actually that misconception, that telework is just not as efficient as co-located work, has vanished for a lot of CEOs,” he tells us. “A lot of CEOs and a lot of employees are saying it was forced, but it’s actually pretty good.” Ruchi Sinha, a senior lecturer in organisational behaviour and management at the University of South Australia, gives the view from Australia, where hybrid working is already becoming a reality, and where most invitations to a face-to-face meeting now come with a video link too. But Sinha says that opportunities to shift to a fully flexible way of working may be being missed, with companies implementing new policies as rigid as the old ones. “I don’t think we are spending enough time thinking about are we giving people choice to shape their jobs, to shape what they do,” she tells us. In our second story, we find out that your genes influence how resistant you are to cold temperatures. To test this, scientists asked a group of men to sit in bathtubs full of icy water to measure their reaction – and how much they shivered. Victoria Wyckelsma, a postdoctoral research fellow in muscle physiology at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, explains what they found and what it means.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Younger people are at lower risk of severe health outcomes if they develop COVID-19, and are therefore not a priority group for vaccine rollout. However, a silent mental health pandemic wave is in full force, and this time it is targeting younger age groups. It is well recognized that older age groups (ages 60+) are at increased risk of severe illness and death if they develop COVID-19. As such, several regions are rolling out vaccines according to age, with priority for older adults. The pandemic’s mental health impact by age The pandemic’s impact on mental health throughout our society will likely outlive COVID-19. As clinical psychologists and trauma researchers, our team is interested in understanding mental health risk and resilience factors during COVID-19. In terms of high-risk groups from a mental health perspective, early evidence suggests that the age trends are inverted, where younger people are at the highest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Our recent study published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry looked at early anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. In close to 50,000 Canadians across several age groups, we showed this trend. There were clinically significant levels of anxiety in 36 per cent of younger Canadians (ages 15-34), followed by 27.1 per cent of people aged 35 to 54, and finally 14.5 per cent of those 55 and older. Younger people also had more COVID-19 worries compared to older groups. These early trends of age-related differences in mental health symptoms have also been shown in other studies, both COVID-19 specific studies and pre-COVID-19 research. Indeed, our previous research has shown that older adults have lower rates of common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. One theory is that older adults have advanced cognitive and behavioural strengths that allow them to have greater emotion regulation. These strengths are developed over time as a result of age-related changes in perspective. From this viewpoint, older adults may have a learned “antibody” against the COVID-19 mental health impacts. Nonetheless, despite these apparent strengths in older groups, mental health symptoms are elevated across all ages compared to pre-COVID times. Pandemic mental health ‘vaccination’ As with the development of the vaccine to reduce the physical health impacts of the pandemic, we must also consider how to address the mental health impacts. If we had a mental health “vaccine,” what might that look like? Based on the research related to collective or mass traumas (traumas affecting large groups of people), we are best suited to aim for secondary prevention. Mental health must be a priority across all ages, but may be especially important in younger people. (Canva) Secondary prevention means reducing the effects of a disease when the disease is already present in its early form. Essentially, it means preventing it from worsening. In the context of mental health, this would mean targeting mental health symptoms early in order to decrease major long-term effects. Early intervention research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) can be especially effective at reducing the risk of worsened mental health issues. It may be appropriate to implement a “CBT-vaccine” for those showing early elevated symptoms. If so, younger people would be a high-risk group to target for priority prevention. Younger people have higher rates of anxiety and other mental health problems. There is also early evidence to suggest that when mental health symptoms are present, younger people may have worse outcomes than older groups (similar to current poorer physical outcomes we are seeing when older adults develop COVID-19), but this research is mixed. What we do know is that mental health problems, especially when long-lasting, can have a major impact on quality of life, daily functioning and physical health, including illness onset and death, for all ages. Longstanding issues may result in loss of employment and are costly for our health-care system. Mental health must be a priority across all ages, but may be especially important in younger people. We need to engage in similar efforts toward applying a widely accessible mental health “vaccine” as we are doing for the COVID-19 vaccine if we truly want to get all elements of this pandemic under control. Unfortunately, for many, receiving scientifically supported treatments delivered by a qualified mental health professional is a luxury. Services are difficult to access, especially during this time when the need is higher. Long term, we must continue investing in mental health professionals to meet the service needs of the population. The initial dosage is digital Due to the limited supply of qualified mental health professionals, a good place to start may be providing widely accessible and scientifically supported online CBT programs. This would eliminate difficult decisions regarding prioritizing access to care. A good place to start addressing mental health issues in young people may be providing scientifically supported online CBT programs. (Canva) Although people recognize the current need for mental health supports, there has been confusion regarding available resources. Uptake has also been low to moderate for publicly funded online mental health programs. In a nationally representative Canadian study conducted in late May, only two per cent of Canadians reported using virtual mental health resources. Publicly funded programs such as Wellness Together and AbilitiCBT are also limited by the duration and frequency of usage available, and there is little scientific information about understanding how these pandemic-specific programs may reduce mental health symptoms, and who might benefit the most. Internet or app-based CBT programs widely vary in terms of content, level of engagement and how effective they are. In a recent publication on digital advancements in mental health, the authors accurately state: “we applaud investments in virtual mental health services by governments and industry but caution that a thoughtful approach is needed to direct those resources to realize its full potential.” Providing effective online self-guided programs could potentially keep milder mental health cases out of the queue for one-on-one treatment with a mental health professional. This would create greater opportunities for more complex and severe cases to receive intensive individual treatments. Several existing online programs targeting specific mental health symptoms are supported by large numbers of clinical trials such as This Way Up. However, they are occasionally costly and it is challenging for consumers to know which programs are scientifically supported and effective, especially with the massive increase of online programs and apps in the past decade. The responsibility should not fall on consumers to figure that out. Think of it this way — we would never ask people to go figure out which COVID-19 vaccine or treatment is best. Health professionals make clear recommendations based on existing well designed clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic is merciless and has targeted all walks of life. It disproportionately affected older generations in its initial physical effects. It will likely disproportionately affect younger generations in its sustained mental health effects. We need to start talking about the mental health vaccine. Mental health Depression Anxiety Pandemic CBT Coronavirus Millennials Cognitive behavioral therapy COVID-19 Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As emergency shelters and encampments emerge in cities across North America, the public has been confronted with a more visible homeless population as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this has led to several crusades aimed to — once again — hide this population from view. I research public responses to homelessness, and I believe that we can do better. Through education and dialogue, we can begin to recognize that we all want the same thing: the end of homelessness, safer neighbourhoods and adequate housing for all. With several years of experience involved in coalition work alongside Ontario’s street-involved population, my doctoral research examines processes of mourning as ways to mobilize public understanding and togetherness. Homelessness need not be viewed as an inevitable part of the fabric of North American society. It was not always omnipresent, and need not continue to be. It has only really become pervasive, and increasing since the 1980s in Canada. Research has argued that it is preventable. Policies produce homelessness Today’s housing crisis is a result of particular policies that are neither inevitable nor intractable. Yet, perhaps most unfortunately, the collective response has too often included blaming, criminalizing and stigmatizing people experiencing homelessness. No longer can we covertly warehouse working-class people experiencing any mixture of bad luck, addictions, mental health challenges and trauma produced by historical oppressions that are difficult to define. The spread of COVID-19 through the shelter system is well-documented, though it took a lawsuit for the City of Toronto to take action. And still, several Canadian cities threaten the evictions of the most vulnerable from encampments. Read more: Cities must end homeless camp evictions during the coronavirus pandemic Various communities made up of outreach workers, nurses and artists — such as the Encampment Support Network in Toronto — meet the material needs that city governments refuse to address. Meanwhile, “dehoused” citizens are shipped off to holding cells in hotels, shelters, community centres and empty apartment buildings, where many already struggling with mental illness or drug addictions are isolated and separated from essential harm reduction services. The results have been disastrous. This homeless camp at Strathcona Park in Vancouver, B.C., developed after city officials shut down the homeless encampment at Oppenheimer Park in late 2020 in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Hope in coalitions What is now emerging is the way in which certain affluent communities have veered toward age-old practices of NIMBYism, fear-mongering and unequal policing. Of course, this is a complex issue. In a talk she gave at the West Coast Women’s Festival in 1981, social justice activist Bernice Johnson Reagon declared: “We’ve pretty much come to the end of a time when you can have a space that is ‘yours only’ — just for the people you want to be there.” Reagon, a lifelong civil rights activist and feminist, wrote and spoke about the desperate need to engage in coalition work, reminding her audience that coalition work “is not work done in your home. Coalition work has to be done in the streets.” Medical sociologist Arthur Frank suggests a conceptual persona he calls the dialogical stoic that combines the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius with the dialogical responsibilities adhered to by the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin. Stoicism is that ability each of us has to choose the best option amid what is sometimes a panoply of difficult circumstances. Frank explains the steadfast commitment to dialogue as a discovery of the suffering of the other, while existing “on the boundary with others.” Frank emphasizes, importantly, Bakhtin’s claim that people are unfinalizable — thus, there is no “last word.” There is no “these types of people.” Collisions open up opportunities for coalitions. Will we seek to discover the other — their stories, their pain, their gifts — as, like always, we have the choice to do so? Or will we band together with those only like us? Will we stay home or take to the streets? ‘Feel the strain’ There has been some thoughtful writing about the teachable moments offered by the pandemic. Students returning to schools certainly have much to digest and teachers have a great deal of material to draw from as they resume in-person classes. But what if we began to consider the teachable moments offered to all of us, even as these opportunities present themselves in public spaces? Cultural critic Henry Giroux describes this as public pedagogy, arguing that classroom learning needs to spill out into “social movements in the streets.” These are certainly uncomfortable moments. But, as Reagon reminds us: “If you feel the strain, you may be doing some good work.” Coronavirus Homelessness housing crisis COVID-19 Housing policies Want to write?

View all partners Languages Bahasa Indonesia English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Remote working is becoming more popular than ever. A study released by the Swiss office provider IWG found that 70% of professionals work remotely at least one day a week, while 53% work remotely for at least half of the week. Some multinationals have their entire staff working remotely, with no fixed office presence at all, which can result in having employees situated all over the world. New technology makes all this possible. While there are certainly benefits, there are also a number of pitfalls. As remote working becomes the new normal for many, it’s important companies adapt and put the right policies in place to ensure their employees feel part of the team and don’t burn out. Nearly 70% of millennials would be more likely to choose an employer who offered remote working according to one study. The benefits are important. Employees value the flexibility it gives them, particularly if they have childcare commitments. People also appreciate escaping long commutes and avoiding office distractions. But there are also growing concerns that people’s mental health and well-being can take a hit when working remotely. In the UK, businesses lose £100m every year due to workplace stress, depression and anxiety. Research shows that being “always on” and accessible by technology while working remotely leads to the blurring of work and non-work boundaries, particularly if you work from home. A 2017 United Nations report found that 41% of remote workers reported high stress levels, compared to just 25% of office workers. Out of sight, out of mind? One of the reasons for this could be the “out of sight, out of mind” mentality that’s commonplace toward remote workers, which leads to a lack of trust, feelings of being an outsider and a tendency for people to think their colleagues are talking negatively about them behind their back. One study of 1,100 workers found that the 52% who worked from home at least some of the time were more likely to feel left out and mistreated, as well as unable to deal with conflict between themselves and colleagues. Navigating sensitive territory in a virtual team is an essential skill. If we’re not careful, issues can fester. Emails can be misinterpreted as being rude or too direct. And, with no visible body language it is tricky to convey our true meanings. Remote working can bring a pressure to be always online. Shutterstock In a virtual environment there is a tendency to focus too much on tasks and too little on relationships. This kind of transactional leadership can be the route taken by leaders who want to get the job done but fail to recognise how important the people are who are completing these tasks. With more emphasis on deadlines and routine information, virtual workers can feel treated as a cog in a machine, rather than an essential part of the team. Such a leadership approach can worsen the sense of isolation that naturally comes with working remotely and can contribute to virtual workplace stress. Good stress, bad stress As part of my research, I’ve spoken to university colleagues and students who work virtually. Feelings of isolation, loneliness and being unable to “switch off”, as well as the lack of social support, were all mentioned. One of the more significant issues raised was that of how virtual working was managed. Interviewees said a lack of feedback from line managers and senior colleagues gave them no benchmark to judge progress, which led to increased feelings of anxiety and a concern as to whether they were “up to standard”. When it comes to work, there are two kinds of stress – the good kind and the bad kind. The Yerkes-Dodson Law (drawn up by psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson) points out that stress can be productive up to a point and then it results in reduced productivity. Being unable to report being stressed (or being uncomfortable doing so), is detrimental as pressure will eventually outweigh an individual’s ability to cope over time. In contrast, one recent study found that colleagues who spend just 15 minutes socialising and sharing their feelings of stress had a 20% increase in performance. The right kind of communication is key to overcoming the trials and tribulations of virtual working. Employers need to put the right structures in place such as scheduled video calls and regular team-building meetups to build rapport. Bosses need to lead by example and create a culture where those outside the office feel valued. But it cuts both ways. Everyone needs to think about what makes them productive, happy and successful in everyday life, and try to replicate this in a remote setting – whether this ranges from taking a walk at lunch time, going to the gym, ringing a friend or reading your favourite book. If the future of work is heading towards more virtual working, then it is not something we can avoid. Instead we should implement ways of managing the stress associated with it, while enjoying the benefits. Work Employment Management Flexible working Workplace ethics Remote working Want to write?

View all partners Languages Español English While some leaders were swinging into action, Boris Johnson was shaking hands with COVID patients. Will Oliver Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger On March 11 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 public health emergency had become a pandemic: 114 countries were affected, there were 121,500 confirmed cases and more than 4,000 people had succumbed to the virus. One year on, we have now seen 115 million confirmed cases globally and more than 2.5 million deaths from COVID-19. “Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,” said the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on that day in 2020. But in the year since that announcement, the fates of many countries have depended on how leaders have chosen their words. The impact of the pandemic was unprecedented and all governments faced challenges dealing with a severe but highly unpredictable threat to the lives of their citizens. And some governments responded better than others. My colleagues and I recently carried out a comparative study of how 27 countries responded to the emergence of the virus and first wave, and how they communicated that response to their citizens. We invited national experts to analyse their government’s communication style, the flow of information on coronavirus and the actions taken by civil society, mapping these responses onto the numbers of cases and deaths in the country in question. Our work reveals contrasting responses that reflect a nation’s internal politics, suggesting that a government’s handling of the pandemic was embedded in existing patterns of leadership. Read more of our coverage of the first anniversary of the pandemic: COVID-19: how to deal with a year of accumulated burnout from working at home Pandemic babies: how COVID-19 has affected child development With news of the spread of COVID-19 flowing across international borders, domestic preventative measures needed to be explained carefully. The WHO proved ill-equipped, provided equivocal and flawed advice regarding international travel, even from Hubei province, and equivocated on the efficacy of wearing masks. So much came down to how individual leaders communicated with their citizens about the risks they faced. Experts in crisis management and social psychologists emphasise the importance of clarity and empathy in communicating during a health emergency. So who did well and who missed the mark? South Korea and Ghana We found two major examples of this style of communication working well in practice. South Korea avoided a lockdown due to clearly communicating the threat of COVID-19 as early as January, encouraging the wearing of masks (which were common previously within the nation in response to an earlier Sars epidemic) and quickly rolling out a contact-tracing app. Each change in official alert level, accompanied by new advice regarding social contact, was carefully communicated by Jung Eun-Kyung, the head of the country’s Centre for Disease Control, who used changes in her own life to demonstrate how new guidance should work in practice. Our World in Data, CC BY The transparency of this approach was echoed in the communication style of the Ghanaian president, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. Akufo-Addo took responsibility for coronavirus policy and explained carefully each measure required, being honest about the challenges the nation faced. Simple demonstrations of empathy earned him acclaim within his nation and also around the world. “We know how to bring the economy back to life. What we don’t know is how to bring people back to life,” he famously said. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has been clear and transparent in his messaging on coronavirus. Igor Golovnov/Alamy Brazil, the UK and India South Korea and Ghana adopted a consistent tone highlighting the risks of the new pandemic and how they could be mitigated. Nations that fared less well encouraged complacency and gave out inconsistent messages about the threat of COVID-19. In March 2020, just three weeks prior to placing the country under lockdown and catching COVID-19 himself, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson downplayed the threat, and said he had been shaking hands with infected people, against the recommendations of his expert advisers. Today, the UK has one of the highest per capita death rates from COVID in the world. Avoiding a full initial lockdown, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who also contracted COVID-19 – called for normality to continue, challenging expert guidance and polarising opinion along partisan lines. Such practices led Brazilians to mistrust the official information and spread of misinformation, while adhering to containment measures became an ideological, rather than a public health, question. ‘It’s just a little flu.’ Brazil would be haunted by its president’s downplaying of the threat of COVID-19. Fernando Bizerra/EPA Meanwhile, Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced a snap lockdown with just four hours notice, which caused an internal migration crisis, with poor labourers leaving cities to walk hundreds or thousands of miles to their rural homes. Understandably, the labourers prioritised their fears of homelessness and starvation over the risk of spreading COVID-19 around the country. None of these responses effectively considered the impact that coronavirus would have on society, or that credibility is earned through consistency. The poor outcomes in each case are a partial reflection of these leadership mistakes. Bad luck or bad judgement? Of course, the unfolding of the pandemic was not solely down to good or bad communication from leaders. Health systems and demographics may also have played a role, and the worst impacted nations not only had strategic weaknesses but are also global transport hubs and popular destinations – London, New York, Paris and so on. With hindsight, closing borders would have been wise, despite the contrary advice from the World Health Organization. Still, it’s evident that leaders who adopted clear, early, expert-led, coherent and empathic guidance fared well in terms of their standing with the public and were able to mitigate the worst effects of the virus. On the other hand, those who politicised the virus, exhibited unrestrained optimism or took to last-minute decision-making oversaw some of the nations with the most cases and deaths.

View all partners Languages Français English Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Less than a week after Conservative Party members defeated a motion to acknowledge the reality of climate change in its official policy, Canada’s Supreme Court reminded Canadians that climate change threatens the future of humanity and cannot be ignored. The court ruled on March 25 that the Liberal government’s carbon pricing plan is constitutional, giving it the go ahead to make sure that each province sets a minimum price on carbon — a key part of the national effort to address climate change. The carbon pricing law, Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, came into force in 2018 and is a central pillar in the federal government’s climate change strategy. But several provinces — including Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan — have been staunch opponents of carbon pricing, arguing that the control of natural resources, including the regulation of greenhouse emissions, belongs solely to the provinces. In its 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court held that climate change was a matter of national concern that justified Parliament’s authority to enact laws under the Constitution’s “peace, order and good government” clause, known as POGG. As environmental and constitutional lawyers, three things in the Supreme Court’s decision stood out to us: It recognized the gravity of climate change for Canadians; the validation of the use of federal law aimed at limiting the harms from one province on another; and the careful use of Parliament’s POGG power to justify such a law. While this ends the three-year fight over national carbon pricing, it doesn’t mean there won’t be ongoing challenges in the evolution of Canadian climate policy. Pricing as a backstop When the federal government’s carbon pricing law came into force it created a backstop price that applies only in provinces or territories that do not have their own equivalent program. The carbon price is currently set at $30 per tonne, and will rise to $50 in 2022 and $170 by 2030. Saskatchewan, Ontario and Alberta each challenged the constitutionality of the law. Parliament, they said, had no business setting national standards in an area of provincial jurisdiction. The Saskatchewan and Ontario Courts of Appeal upheld the act, but the Alberta Court of Appeal said it was unconstitutional. Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks to supporters at an anti-carbon tax rally in Calgary, on Oct. 5, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh In defence of the law, Canada pointed to the national and international character of greenhouse gas emissions. It argued that a federal backstop was necessary to ensure all provinces did their part. Those court challenges ended up at the Supreme Court, where the majority of the justices sided with Canada and many interveners. Here are three things that stood out in their decision. 1. Climate change poses a serious threat Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Richard Wagner underscored the gravity and existential nature of climate change: “Climate change is real … and it poses a grave threat to humanity’s future.” The court recognized that the effects of climate change “have been and will be particularly severe and devastating in Canada,” including floods and forest fires, the degradation of soil and water and the increased frequency and severity of heatwaves. Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Richard Wagner gestures as he responds to a question during his annual news conference in June 2020, in Ottawa. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld It acknowledged the climate crisis poses a greater risk in the Arctic and coastal communities, and threatens access to food and traditional ways of life in Indigenous communities. It acknowledged that vulnerable communities would bear the brunt of climate change. This sets the stage for other litigants, such as youth, who are advocating for a recognition that they have constitutionally protected rights to a stable and safe climate under the Charter. The day the Supreme Court released its decision, youth plaintiffs in Ontario moved one step closer to making this claim in court. Read more: What a Dutch Supreme Court decision on climate change and human rights means for Canada 2. The carbon price upheld While there has never been much doubt that Parliament has jurisdiction to enact laws relating to climate change, it was less clear whether the court would uphold this act under POGG versus another federal power, such as taxation or criminal law. POGG has been a source of controversy for years. The courts have been very careful to apply it only in limited circumstances and to clearly defined matters, rejecting jurisdiction over broad subjects like pollution in favour of more precise matters such as marine pollution by ocean dumping. The Supreme Court rejected greenhouse gas emissions as the subject matter of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, but accepted the more restricted national carbon pricing floor. A key part of the court’s acceptance that it was a matter of national concern was the fact that a lack of co-operation among provinces could expose other provinces to “grave harm.” The court noted that climate change has no boundaries and can affect all provinces and territories throughout Canada. Read more: Supreme Court case on carbon price is about climate change, not the Constitution The climate crisis is a global problem, the court recognized, and “any province’s failure to act threatens Canada’s ability to meet its international obligations, which in turn hinders Canada’s ability to push for international action to reduce [greenhouse gas] emissions.” 3. National concern is not a federal blank cheque The court took pains to make it clear that the ruling does not create a precedent for Parliament to extend its jurisdiction on other issues, responding to the Alberta Court of Appeal’s apocalyptic warning that upholding the law would open the door to Ottawa being able to limit home heating to 16C or ban cattle. According to the court, the act respects the essential balance of Canadian federalism and leaves provincial autonomy and jurisdiction largely intact for two reasons. First, the Act recognizes jurisdiction for a pricing mechanism, not greenhouse gas emissions more broadly. Second, it creates a floor and a backstop, meaning that provinces can still address climate change, even to adopt more stringent standards if they wish. In other words, there can be a constitutional “double aspect” that allows both levels of government to act. Moving forward At the end of the day, this ruling reflects an understanding by the Supreme Court that climate change is a multi-faceted, collective action problem that requires co-operation from all players. It recognizes that the emissions of one jurisdiction have implications for others. It is a decision that accepts Canada’s role in the international fight to slow climate change, and it clarifies that there is ample space in our Constitution for a national legal framework on climate change. With the legal parameters of carbon pricing now clear, let’s hope time and resources can be spent transitioning to a clean economy with a just transition for workers and building our resilience to climate disruption. There’s no time for laggards who would rather pretend climate change is not real and play political games. This is a corrected version of a story originally published on March 28, 2021. The earlier story said the carbon price would rise to $170 in 2050, instead of 2030.

And we talk to a researcher who asked people to sit in bathtubs full of ice-cold water to find out why some of us are able to stand the cold better than others. For many people who can do their job from home, the pandemic meant a sudden shift from office-based to remote working. But after a year of working from home, some company bosses really don’t want it to become the new normal. The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, called it an “aberration”, and Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it wasn’t sustainable, because of how hard it is to maintain culture and collaboration with teams working remotely. Meanwhile, others are fully embracing a remote work future. Twitter said its employees could work from home forever, and Spotify announced a “work from anywhere” policy. Other firms are starting to announce more hybrid policies, where people are expected to split their week between the home and the office: in March, BP told employees they would be expected to work from home two days a week. In this episode, we talk to researchers who have been studying the shift to remote working during the pandemic about their findings. In France, Marie-Colombe Afota, assistant professor in leadership, IÉSEG School of Management in France, talks us through the initial results of a new study she did in late 2020 of 4,000 employees at a large French multinational. “The more employees felt that the organisation generally values being visible in the office, the more they felt expected to be constantly available while in remote work,” says Afota. “And, in turn, two months later, the less they felt productive and happy in remote work.” A year of working from home has left some people close to burnout, according to Dave Cook, a PhD researcher in anthropology at University College London who has been interviewing people about their experiences of shifting to remote work during the pandemic. “Burnout and work-life balance is the forgotten public health emergency that’s emerging through throughout this lockdown,” he tells us. And he says that companies should start communicating with their staff now about what the future has in store: “So their employees can get on with planning the rest of their lives.” For others, the shift to remote work has been a surprisingly good experience. Jean-Nicolas Reyt, an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal, has been tracking the language that chief executives in North America used to talk about remote working in 2020. “What you see is that actually that misconception, that telework is just not as efficient as co-located work, has vanished for a lot of CEOs,” he tells us. “A lot of CEOs and a lot of employees are saying it was forced, but it’s actually pretty good.” Ruchi Sinha, a senior lecturer in organisational behaviour and management at the University of South Australia, gives the view from Australia, where hybrid working is already becoming a reality, and where most invitations to a face-to-face meeting now come with a video link too. But Sinha says that opportunities to shift to a fully flexible way of working may be being missed, with companies implementing new policies as rigid as the old ones. “I don’t think we are spending enough time thinking about are we giving people choice to shape their jobs, to shape what they do,” she tells us. In our second story, we find out that your genes influence how resistant you are to cold temperatures. To test this, scientists asked a group of men to sit in bathtubs full of icy water to measure their reaction – and how much they shivered. Victoria Wyckelsma, a postdoctoral research fellow in muscle physiology at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, explains what they found and what it means.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a number of new behaviours into daily routines, like physical distancing, mask-wearing and hand sanitizing. Meanwhile, many old behaviours such as attending events, eating out and seeing friends have been put on hold. However, one old behaviour that has persisted, and has arguably been amplified due to COVID-19, is sitting — and it is not surprising to see why. Whether sitting during transportation, work, screen time or even meals, everyday environments and activities are tailored nearly exclusively to prolonged sitting. As such, sedentary behaviours, like sitting, make up the vast majority of our waking day. Pre-COVID-19 estimates place the average Canadian adult’s sedentary behaviour at around 9.5 hours per day. Current daily sedentary time is likely even higher as a result of stay-at-home orders, limitations on businesses and recreational facilities, and elevated health anxieties. Health vs. well-being The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased time spent sitting because people are staying home more. (Pixabay) This is a problem, given that chronic excessive levels of sedentary time have been linked to greater risk of diabetes, heart disease, mortality and even some cancers. However, for many people, their own judgments and feelings about their quality of life (also known as subjective well-being) may be more important and relevant for informing their health decisions and behaviours than potentially developing chronic diseases. Subjective well-being encompasses an individual’s own evaluation of their quality of life. It includes concepts like affect (positive and negative feelings) and life satisfaction. Interestingly, these evaluations can conflict with physical health outcomes. For example, a person could have diabetes but still report good subjective well-being, while someone with no physical health conditions may report poor subjective well-being. This is important, as it means how an individual feels about their own health may not always align with what their body may demonstrate. That’s why evaluating subjective well-being is vital for painting a holistic picture of health. Different contexts of sitting Sitting more, and long periods of inactivity, are associated with negative affect. (Unsplash/Bench Accounting) Relatively little research has examined the relationships between sedentary behaviour and subjective well-being. Exploring these relationships is important, as different contexts of sitting — such as socializing versus screen time — may yield different feelings or judgments of subjective well-being, unlike relationships between physical health and sedentary behaviour, which tend to be more consistent. As health psychologists focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, we reviewed the scientific literature describing relationships between measures of sedentary behaviours such as physical inactivity and screen time, and subjective well-being as reflected by affect, life satisfaction and overall subjective well-being. Our review highlights three main findings. First, sedentary behaviour, physical inactivity and screen time demonstrated weak but statistically significant correlations with subjective well-being. In other words, those who reported sitting more often and spending longer periods with no physical activity reported lower positive affect, higher negative affect and lower life satisfaction than those who sat less and moved more. We also found that this relationship was most apparent in studies that compared people who were very sedentary to those who had more active lifestyles. Not all sitting is bad sitting Some contexts of sitting, such as reading, playing an instrument or socializing, had positive associations. (Unsplash/Jonathan Chng) Our second main finding relates to the context of the sedentary behaviour. While many studies examined overall sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity, some studies looked at specific contexts or domains of sitting and its relationship with subjective well-being. These studies revealed that different domains of sedentary behaviour have unique relationships with subjective well-being. For example, screen time was consistently and negatively associated with subjective well-being. However, domains like socializing, playing an instrument and reading actually demonstrated positive associations with subjective well-being. These results differ from the traditional health-related sedentary behaviour research, in which all sedentary behaviour is viewed as harmful to health. Our review suggests that some types of sedentary behaviour may be beneficial to quality of life. Rather, not all sitting is the same in terms of subjective well-being. So when people work towards reducing their sitting time, they should consider not just how much to reduce, but what kind to reduce. Less sitting is good for everyone Most people would likely benefit from sitting less. (Pixabay) Our third main finding concerns overall sitting and self-perceived levels of sedentary behaviour. Most studies found a weak statistically significant association between higher overall sedentary time and lower subjective well-being. However, in studies where participants were asked to compare their sedentary behaviour to how much they normally sit, those who perceived themselves as more sedentary than usual reported significantly poorer subjective well-being. These findings suggest that how much an individual sits overall may not be as important as how much an individual sits compared to their usual level of sitting. This infers that anyone, regardless of how much they normally sit or are physically active, may potentially benefit from sitting less. COVID-19 continues to influence daily life and routines. Even as businesses and gyms eventually reopen, and we feel more comfortable gathering with others and eventually stop wearing masks, we will almost certainly continue to sit and sitting will continue to change how we feel. While we may not be able to eliminate all of our sitting, we can all be mindful of both how much we can reduce it and where we can reduce it from to be healthier and feel better.

We’ve been flooded with metaphors, idioms, symbols, neologisms, memes and tweets. Some have referred to this deluge of words as an infodemic. And the words we use matter. To paraphrase the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: the limits of our language are the limits of our world. Words place parameters around our thoughts. These parameters are the lenses we look through. According to literary theorist Kenneth Burke, “terministic screens” are defined as the language through which we perceive our reality. The screen creates meaning for us, shaping our perspective of the world and our actions within it. The language acting as a screen then determines what our mind selects and what it deflects. This selective action has the capacity to enrage us or engage us. It can unite us or divide us, like it has during COVID-19. Metaphors shape our understanding Think about the effect of seeing COVID-19 through the terministic screen of war. Using this military metaphor, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described COVID-19 as an “enemy to be beaten.” He asserts that this “enemy can be deadly,” but the “fight must be won.” Read more: War metaphors used for COVID-19 are compelling but also dangerous The effect of this military language conflicts with the perpetuated myth that “we are all in this together.” But rather, it invokes aggressive combat against an enemy. It signals an us-versus-them divide, promoting the creation of a villain through scapegoating and racist attitudes.

A metaphor that encourages “waiting out the storm?” Or working to help a neighbour?

Re-framing COVID-19 in this way has the capacity to convince us that we actually are “all in this together.” An inspiring initiative, #ReframeCovid, is an open collective intended to promote alternative metaphors to describe COVID-19.

(AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo) Taking away our critical thinking In a blog post, linquist Brigitte Nerlich compiled a list of metaphors used during the pandemic. Although the metaphors of war and battle are foremost, others include bullet trains, an evil trickster, a petri dish, a hockey game, a football match, Whack-a-mole and even a grey rhino. Then there is the omnipresent light at the end of the tunnel. And while they offer a way to re-frame our reality, helping the unfamiliar become familiar and rationalize our perceptions, there is danger lurking. Metaphors can substitute for critical thinking by offering easy answers to complex issues. Ideas can remain unchallenged if glossed over, falling prey to the trap of metaphors. But metaphors also have the capacity to augment insight and understanding. They can foster critical thinking. One such example is the dance metaphor. It has been effectively used to describe the longer term effort and evolving global collaboration needed to keep COVID-19 controlled until vaccines are widely distributed. COVID-19 buzzwords Besides metaphors, other linguistic structures act as our terministic screens as well. Buzzwords related to the current pandemic have also increased. We grimace or laugh at covidiot, covideo party and covexit. Then there is Blursday, zoom-bombing and quaran-teams. According to a British language consultant, the pandemic has fostered more than 1,000 new words. Why has this happened? According to a socio-linguistic analysis, new words can bond us like “a lexical social glue.” Language can unite us in a common struggle of expressing our anxiety and facing the chaos. Common linguistic expressions decrease isolation and increase our engagement with others. Rustic wooden sign with a daily drink special listed as ‘Quarantini.’ (Shutterstock) In a similar way, memes can reduce the space between us and foster social engagement. Most often sarcastic or ironic, memes about COVID-19 have been plentiful. Like metaphors, these buzzwords, puns and images embody symbols that invoke responses and motivate social action. More recently, resisters of COVID language have flooded social media sites. Frustrated with the never-ending ordeal, online contributors refuse to name the pandemic. Instead they use absurd “pan-words”; calling it a panini, a pantheon, a pajama or even a pasta dish. These ludicrous words frolic with the terministic screen of “pandemic,” deconstructing the word to expose the bizarre meaningless nature of the virus and the heightened frustration with it.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger When I began working in disaster and emergency management, there was a funny anecdote suggesting the job was 98 per cent paperwork and two per cent adrenalin. Looking around at my office environment, I failed to see much adrenalin. To make sense of this, I researched some major disasters and discovered that when they strike, emergency managers transition to working in emergency co-ordination centres. These nerve centres often look like something out of the movies, with people staring intently at their computers while large screens everywhere display critical information. During the devastating Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016, which destroyed entire subdivisions and caused more than $1 billion in damage, I finally understood the “two per cent adrenalin” aspect of our work. For months, the work was non-stop and around the clock. Soon, I noticed the initial state of exhilaration was replaced by a state of exhaustion. A helicopter battles a wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alta., in 2016. The wildfire forced nearly 90,000 to flee Canada’s oilsands region — and resulted in serious workplace stress for emergency workers. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson At that time, I was reminded of the 2004 book, When the Body Says No: The Cost of Hidden Stress, written by Canadian physician Gabor Maté, that outlines the four most stressful stimuli: Lack of information, uncertainty, lack of control and conflict. I observed that during a disaster, all of these factors are present in droves. In a disaster, critical decisions must be made with incomplete or contradictory information. Lack of control and uncertainty emerge when navigating policies, guidelines and laws. There’s often conflict with resource allocation and conflicting priorities. Other notable factors include atypical working hours, extremes of activity and a sedentary work environment. While some features are unique to our profession, I’m under no illusion that we’re alone in our experiences. Many other professions and positions face similar challenges. Exhaustion follows exhilaration While short-term workplace stress is to be expected, the problem emerges with long-term sustained stress. As Hungarian scientist Hans Selye described in 1950 in his seminal general adaptation syndrome about workplace stress, after sustaining a period of exhilaration, stressed employees eventually reach the exhaustion phase and can no longer sustain additional pressure. Today in my clinical psychology practice, my clients who work in various fields tell me about exhaustion, irritability, impatience, trouble concentrating and taking in new information and feeling under-appreciated at work, with some even contemplating quitting their jobs. In 2019, the World Health Organization identified a syndrome it labelled “burnout” resulting from chronic workplace stress. Now people who report feeling depleted of energy or exhausted, mentally distanced from or cynical about their jobs and experiencing problems getting their work done can be diagnosed with a workplace injury. The WHO labelled chronic workplace stress ‘burnout’ two years ago. Elisa Ventur/Unsplash Burnout as the result of workplace stress carries significant implications for employers. Canadian occupational health and safety standards require employers to protect the physical and mental health of their workers. If people are meeting the criteria for burnout, organizations may be neglecting their legislated duty to ensure psychologically safe workplaces. Preventing, mitigating stress The good news is something can be done. While it will require genuine organizational commitment, prevention and mitigation are key. But to get at the heart of the problem, we must first ask if employers are even tracking psychological safety in the workplace. Of those that do, most merely encourage staff to exercise more, meditate, sleep better and eat a more balanced diet. This is, quite simply, passing the buck onto an already depleted workforce and does nothing to address the core of the problem. The answer is not to recommend Band-Aid solutions, suggesting employees try even harder in their downtime to compensate for organizational neglect. Workplaces must implement clear policies to reflect their commitment to workplace mental health and safety, including appointing a wellness champion. (Unsplash) For meaningful change, organizations must first implement clear policies reflecting their commitment to workplace mental health and psychological safety, and appoint a wellness champion and leaders who model these values. The next step is identifying workplace hazards through employee engagement surveys, workplace risk assessments, incident investigations, exit interviews and disability claim data if available. Identifying controls to prevent psychological harm is also necessary. Respectful workplace policies Once hazards have been identified, prevention and mitigation measures must follow. Organizations must define and train employees on their duties and responsibilities, monitor workload, consider flexible work arrangements, clearly communicate priorities and ensure respectful workplace policies are understood and that managers who defy them are held accountable. Organizations must address environmental risks by encouraging movement, breaks and getting sunlight. Finally, documenting and reporting hazards as a measure for ongoing program development is necessary because it helps inform company policy as part of holistic continuous improvement efforts. Throughout the entire cycle, I remind organizational leaders to remain present to support staff through the execution of all tasks — and of the value in fostering happy and engaged teams. Research shows that the highest performing workplace teams have one thing in common: psychological safety. When people feel safe, they are engaged and committed to their work, and this builds organizational resilience. Employers who manage to get ahead of the burnout curve will gain a distinct advantage over other organizations.

As researchers in global health, we have analyzed the effective use of cross-border measures internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Pandemics and Borders Project. At this critical stage of the COVID-19 response, our findings point to the urgent need to address the gaps in border management to prevent another resurgence of the virus in the fall. Modelling studies show that herd immunity — estimated to be at least 90 per cent of total population vaccinated given highly transmissible variants — will be difficult to reach, despite Canada’s progress in mass vaccination. The federal government announced that hotel quarantine requirements will end on July 5 for fully vaccinated returning citizens and residents. This will be only the first phase of easing travel restrictions over the coming months. Travel-related risks need to be carefully managed, balancing growing pressure to reopen with the race to get Canadians vaccinated. How well this is accomplished will determine whether Canada is set on a path towards recovery or a fourth wave. Ongoing gaps in Canada’s border management Federal officials have repeatedly touted Canada’s border measures during COVID-19 as among the most stringent in the world. Yet the third wave of variant-driven infections, hospitalizations and lockdowns across the country, and growing risks from the Delta variant first detected in India, suggest otherwise. Read more: COVID-19 Delta variant in Canada: FAQ on origins, hotspots and vaccine protection Unlike Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and many other jurisdictions, Canada’s mandatory testing and hotel quarantine measures were only introduced in January and February 2021. By that point, significant and repeated virus importation had already occurred. Canadian policy remains inconsistent for travellers arriving by air versus land. A Public Safety Canada briefing note from March 10, 2021, reported only seven per cent of travellers entering via land crossings are subject to quarantine requirements. Broad exemptions include cross-border students, technicians working on vaguely defined critical infrastructure, public officials and other categories of arrivals. Beyond the three-day hotel quarantine for air arrivals, the 14-day quarantine for non-exempt travellers has been largely self-monitored and sporadically enforced. Government officials have often claimed fewer than two per cent of total SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canada are associated with international travel, but exemptions, inconsistencies and gaps in tracing and testing make this figure unreliable. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Most concerning, data collection and analysis has been incomplete, failing to provide accurate risk assessment evidence to inform border management. Government officials have often claimed fewer than two per cent of total SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canada are associated with international travel. This figure has been used to justify arguments against improved border measures. Gaps and lags in contact tracing and reporting from provincial authorities, combined with exemptions and inconsistencies in testing and quarantine, means this figure is unreliable and inadequate for policy decisions. Further doubts about available data arise from Public Health Agency of Canada reporting that show more than 45 per cent of all exposures in Canada are from an “unknown source.” To appropriately assess risks, methods must go beyond these partial counts. They must model risks of community transmission from infected travellers — especially those with a high-transmission variant — who may remain unidentified and/or come in contact with the wider population. Why effective border management matters now Border management grounded in sound risk assessment is particularly critical now. Canadians await opportunities to travel more freely to international destinations, and there are growing questions about how and when the Canada-U.S. border may reopen to non-essential travel. However, vast discrepancies in global vaccine access and distribution mean high levels of infection and transmission worldwide. More variants will likely emerge, some highly transmissible and virulent, some potentially vaccine evasive. If the latter is imported into Canada in the coming weeks, as previous variants were, this has the potential to undermine gains made through vaccination. The result would be another cycle of lockdowns, shuttered businesses and school closures. Easing travel restrictions safely The Peace Arch Canada/USA border crossing in Surrey, B.C. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Easing measures requires some doable fixes that, if done right, lay the foundation for the phasing in an immunization-based border management system. Here are four recommendations from our Pandemics and Borders Project: Better communication is needed. Public officials and journalists have often used terms such as “travel bans” and “border closures,” yet hundreds of thousands of travellers have arrived in Canada each month. As Canada eases travel restrictions, we recommend reframing the issue as risk-based border management. The clear task is to align who can travel across Canadian borders, and under what conditions, with the evolving science concerning COVID-19 vaccines. Now is the time to prevent, rather than react to, a potential fourth wave. Taking action after a highly transmissible variant is already within our borders has proven too slow and ineffective. Prevention means plugging existing holes in the system and then gradually easing restrictions starting with fully vaccinated travellers. Prioritize effective testing and self-quarantine. Testing and quarantine have been criticized by some for restricting freedom and imposing undue burdens on travellers. But options can be unobtrusive, encourage vaccination and ultimately prevent a fourth wave in Canada. This requires better alignment with best practices worldwide. Strengthen risk assessment. Risk assessment is essential to identifying existing weaknesses in the testing and quarantine protocols for international and domestic travellers. Public access to appropriately detailed and standardized data should also be improved. Without better data collection, reporting and analysis of travel-related risks, we are largely flying in the dark. As mass vaccination continues at home and abroad, and Canadians anticipate easing of travel restrictions, strengthening border management and risk assessment should be key parts of Canada’s strategy for reopening its borders.

The main source of these data is the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which regularly reports on sites of potential exposure to the virus in Canada, including domestic and international flights. Based on these reported exposures, PHAC estimates that international travel has accounted for between 0.4 per cent in May to 2.7 per cent in July 2020 of total confirmed cases over the past eight months. These estimates are then regularly quoted in the media by industry representatives, public health officials and government. On the basis of this data, which suggests there is a low risk from travel, governments have hesitated to put into place stricter measures regarding who travels and what protocols they must follow. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces new travel restrictions and arrival protocols; courtesy CTV News. For example, on Jan. 21, British Columbia Premier John Horgan defended his decision not to restrict inter-provincial travellers on the grounds that the government can only act “if they are causing harm to the health and safety of British Columbians. If we see transmission increase … we will impose stronger restrictions on non-essential travellers.” Our international team is analyzing decision-making on the use of travel-related measures during the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries, including Canada. Comparing Canada’s travel-related measures with other countries, and the methods for detecting and counting imported infections, we argue that often-cited numbers are likely to under-represent travel-related COVID-19 cases. The current system is not systematically or rigorously collecting enough data to provide the basis for broad policy decisions. This comes at a time when new COVID-19 variants make sound travel policies even more critical. A more robust, timely and accurate system is urgently needed. Read more: Why new COVID-19 variants are on the rise and spreading around the world Counting cases Current estimates are based on international travellers arriving by air. Passengers must quarantine and self-monitor for 14 days and, if symptomatic, to get tested. If they test positive, and they report having been on an international or domestic flight, an alert is added to an online list of potential exposures. Passengers in nearby seat rows are deemed at higher risk and may be notified. All other travellers are expected to check alerts and should be quarantining regardless. Only direct cases involving air passengers are counted. Any subsequent community transmission by travellers traced or otherwise is not officially counted. There is no routine testing or contact tracing of travellers entering Canada. Only self-identifying symptomatic air travellers testing positive are included in current data. Travellers by land and sea, along with air travellers who are infected but untested or asymptomatic, are not. And no data is being collected on inter-provincial travel beyond detected exposures on domestic flights. The current methods also make questionable assumptions about the reliability of testing, contact tracing and quarantine. Multiple tests over time are often needed to confirm infection; there are many false negatives and new variants are proving especially elusive. There is insufficient capacity to contact-trace all travellers at current volumes. It’s assumed that all international arrivals adhere to the mandatory 14-day quarantine. Given limited enforcement, however, some arrivals may not quarantine properly for the entire time, if at all. Uncounted cases When measuring travel-related infections, there is a narrow focus on virus transmission within aircraft. In November 2020, citing recent research, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam stated that “there have been very few reports, extremely rare reports, actually, of transmission aboard aircraft.” Last summer, airlines urged the government to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions, this time by adopting a ‘science-based approach’ that would open travel to countries with low risks of infection. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette However, many of the studies that report a low risk of catching the coronavirus on a flight are sponsored by the airline industry, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Importantly, these studies overlook infection risks along an entire journey. Since Jan. 7, anyone flying to Canada from another country must provide a negative molecular test result (taken within 72 hours of travelling) to reduce the number of coronavirus-positive travellers. While this will help, this ignores exposures that occur during the three days between the test and actual travel. Then there’s the journey to and from airports. Airport taxi drivers, for example, have contracted the virus from travellers. Many international passengers catch connecting domestic flights without isolating upon initial entry “unless there are provincial or territorial restrictions.” These passengers will also transit through airports before boarding connecting flights with domestic passengers. Non-flight infections linked to these scenarios are not currently counted. Making travel safer Travel and COVID-19 pandemic are intimately connected. The virus was originally imported into Canada by travel, and new infections continue to be brought in each day. This includes COVID-19 variants. Even with the current partial data, PHAC reported more than 160 international flights and 90 domestic flights between Jan. 7 and Jan. 17, carrying confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. These cases have occurred despite new testing requirements. If we’re going to make effective policy decisions to manage travel and COVID-19, we need far better data. The current tracking system is overwhelmed, so expanding data collection will be challenging. Reducing numbers to essential travellers only is an important starting point. Resources can then be focused on improved testing, contact tracing and quarantine. Random sampling could be used to estimate infections by number of travellers at different points of entry, modes of transport and points along a journey. Ramping up and sharing the genomic sequences of positive results is then essential to identify any imported cases of new variants more thoroughly and quickly. Only then can we get an accurate sense of travel-related risks and how to best address them. Travel Canada Travel restrictions COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Contact tracing COVID-19 variants Want to write?

These cases have occurred despite new testing requirements. If we’re going to make effective policy decisions to manage travel and COVID-19, we need far better data. The current tracking system is overwhelmed, so expanding data collection will be challenging. Reducing numbers to essential travellers only is an important starting point. Resources can then be focused on improved testing, contact tracing and quarantine. Random sampling could be used to estimate infections by number of travellers at different points of entry, modes of transport and points along a journey. Ramping up and sharing the genomic sequences of positive results is then essential to identify any imported cases of new variants more thoroughly and quickly. Only then can we get an accurate sense of travel-related risks and how to best address them. Travel Canada Travel restrictions COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Contact tracing COVID-19 variants Want to write?

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Women remain underrepresented in a number of high-profile fields like finance and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Experts say there’s a number of reasons for these imbalances, including an overly masculine culture, gender stereotypes, scarcity of role models for women and perceptions of poor work-life balance across various male-dominated industries. Whether organizations are doing so because they’ve recognized the practical benefits of gender diversity or they’re responding to external pressures — including investors pushing for gender representation — companies around the world have responded by investing substantial resources into recruiting and retaining women. These efforts have resulted in a range of diversity and inclusion initiatives, including offers of a wide range of benefits and mentorship opportunities for recently hired employees. Regardless of these changes, however, progress on achieving gender parity continues to move slowly. Appealing directly to women These continued gender parity challenges reinforce the need to rebrand corporate communications to signal the explicit recruitment of women. There’s also a pressing need to demonstrate that working in these fields will allow women to pursue and achieve their career goals. In this move towards rebranding, recruitment strategies around paid internships, particularly job postings, are a critical first step. That’s because internships offer candidates a relatively low-stakes opportunity to gain experience in a particular industry. They also provide organizations with critical access to job candidates who have completed internships and who want to continue working with the organization. Those employees have already had a realistic preview of the work they’ll be doing as well as the organizational culture, a benefit to both employer and employee. The power of words Job postings also provide an opportunity for organizations to advertise for an open position and highlight the benefits of working for the company in a way that attracts potential applicants. But we’re well aware of the power of words, and the language used in job postings may play a role in discouraging or dissuading women from applying for positions. Men and women respond differently to different types of language in job posts. (Charles Deluvio/Unsplash) Previous research suggests that men and women respond differently to agentic language (which is self-oriented and focuses on power and achievement) and communal language (which focuses on harmony and collaboration) language, with men identifying more with agentic and women with communal goals. Using an established dictionary of agentic and communal words, we assessed the language of internship job postings in a male-dominated industry. We find that agentic language continued to permeate internship job postings across the financial services industry, even those nationally recognized for their diversity and inclusion initiatives. This creates a significant mismatch, since women feel a stronger sense of fit with the position and are more interested in applying when job postings include higher levels of communal language. The main takeaway from our study is that excessive agentic language in job postings discourages female applicants by diminishing the appeal of the position, consequently slowing down any progress towards gender diversity in male-dominated industries. Curb subtle gender bias Our research shows that aspiring female applicants are highly attuned to the ways in which job postings describe the available positions and the company’s organizational culture. We’ve found that gendered language in job postings plays a role in the systemic gender imbalance in male-dominated industries. Companies interested in recruiting more women should pay closer attention to language in job postings as a first step to reducing this subtle form of gender bias. That means organizations should prioritize communal rather than agentic language and goals. Business leaders should pay close attention to the language they use in job postings if they want to build a more gender-diverse workplace. (Unsplash) We encourage organizations to extend this concept beyond job postings to other areas where potential applicants seek out information about the company, like websites and annual reports. So instead of this kind of agentic phrasing: • Benefit from an independent and goal-oriented culture that provides the foundation for your success. • Company X is looking for keen, responsible and capable individuals eager to succeed. • You will capably contribute to the company’s hard-won reputation. Consider this kind of communal phrasing: • Benefit from our inclusive culture that supports the group while also respecting conversation and debate. • We appreciate self-learners with strong interpersonal skills. • As a valued member of our team, we will work together to develop a shared culture of inclusivity, loyalty and trust. The bottom line Effective communications for the recruitment of a diverse workforce demands careful attention to the language used in job postings. Otherwise, our research shows that organizations may unknowingly alienate a significant portion of the workforce. By recognizing and removing subtle forms of biased language that deter women from applying, organizations can take an important first step to attract a more gender-diverse workforce and improve their competitiveness in the job market.

View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of neighbourhoods and how they fare in terms of walkability and wheelability. Neighbourhood walkability and wheelability are defined as the “measure of how well a neighbourhood fosters active forms of transportation.” Very walkable and wheelable neighbourhoods have built environments, or human-made surroundings, that support physical and social activity. Built environment design features that characterize walkable and wheelable neighbourhoods can include sidewalks, curb cuts and pedestrian traffic signals. When appropriately constructed, these features can support inclusion and in many cases, neighbourhoods that are designed with this in mind are good for everyone. Unfortunately, most neighbourhood built environments are not designed for everyone. They can in fact create exclusionary environments for people with disabilities and older adults. The pandemic brings into focus neighbourhood walkability and wheelability by highlighting persistent inaccessibility issues. It also creates the opportunity to advocate for change and bring about rapid and innovative solutions. Barriers and facilitators to mobility As neighbourhood walkability and wheelability are impacted by the built environment, poorly maintained and constructed neighbourhoods can create barriers that prevent community access and eliminate opportunities to participate in local activities. These barriers — like the condition of streets, sidewalks and crosswalks — can impact anyone but frequently affect those living with disabilities. Research finds that when streets are in even slight disrepair, people with severe mobility impairments are four times more likely to report difficulty walking compared to those living in “good” neighbourhoods (neighbourhoods without cracks in sidewalks and potholes). Even slightly increasing the quality of streets could help people both access and remain involved in their communities. Neighbourhood built environments during the pandemic, like pop-up patios, created barriers to accessibility. (Atiya Mahmood), Author provided Simple measures, such as involving people with disabilities in research and planning, are found to create targeted solutions to barriers and enhance the accessibility of neighbourhoods. In the past, there were limited opportunities for people with disabilities to have their opinions heard. With the recent rise of participatory research methods, however, they are increasingly working as “co-researchers.” This helps create opportunities for collaboration with municipal officials and community service providers. The shift towards participatory research moves us away from only researchers collecting data. Innovative data collection methods, such as user-led environmental audit tools, champion this shift. They help capture the users’ perspective and provide a more holistic understanding of environmental features affecting walkability and wheelability. Overlooked accessibility and COVID-19 Neighbourhood built environments create barriers to inclusion that have been intensified by the pandemic. For example, added challenges that have arisen in response to the pandemic can include communication difficulties for those who are deaf and hard of hearing caused by plexiglass shields and masks, inaccessibility of hand hygiene products for mobility device users because they’re placed too high and increased navigational barriers like those from pop-up patios. As the pandemic draws on, it has become glaringly clear that people living with disabilities have been inordinately impacted. By and large, these strategies were intended to help us but they bring into focus our habitual pattern of overlooking accessibility and not consulting those with lived experiences. A historical opportunity to advocate for change Canada is at a historical crossroads to becoming barrier-free. The recent ushering in of accessibility acts, at both the federal and provincial levels, is creating the necessary infrastructure to enforce the creation of accessible built environments and the equitable inclusion of people with disabilities. Post-pandemic recovery presents an opportunity for creating accessible environments as barriers have been exposed and the need to involve those with experience in creating solutions has been reinforced. The alignment of research, public and political will and the pandemic-era realization that radical and rapid social change is possible creates the perfect conditions to create a Canada that provides access for all.
