Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women).

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Advisory committee recommends AstraZeneca vaccine for people 30 and older Thorold's 'Titan of T-Bones' turns 71 Niagara-on-the-Lake woman $59K richer after winning Catch the Ace jackpot Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.1322150072150072,0.4675685425685425,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Thorold hospital worker offers realistic look into the everyday life at the intensive care unit Apr 30, 2021 3:23 PM Ontario asks for mandatory three-day hotel quarantines at land crossings Apr 30, 2021 1:04 PM Over 3,000 known active cases in Niagara, with over 170 in Thorold Apr 30, 2021 12:21 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Thorold hospital worker offers realistic look into the everyday life at the intensive care unit Apr 30, 2021 3:23 PM Ontario asks for mandatory three-day hotel quarantines at land crossings Apr 30, 2021 1:04 PM Over 3,000 known active cases in Niagara, with over 170 in Thorold Apr 30, 2021 12:21 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women).

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Third Thorold-wide food drive to go ahead amidst unprecedented need May 14, 2021 4:10 PM Police seek assistance locating missing Welland teen (update: found safe) May 14, 2021 3:52 PM Canadian National Team member signs with River Lions May 14, 2021 3:35 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Third Thorold-wide food drive to go ahead amidst unprecedented need May 14, 2021 4:10 PM Police seek assistance locating missing Welland teen (update: found safe) May 14, 2021 3:52 PM Canadian National Team member signs with River Lions May 14, 2021 3:35 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Third Thorold-wide food drive to go ahead amidst unprecedented need Police seek assistance locating missing Welland teen (update: found safe) Canadian National Team member signs with River Lions Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.12858585858585855,0.4445454545454545,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women).

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News More cases than reported of India-origin variant of concern are probably present in Niagara, says Hirji May 28, 2021 4:38 PM Local resident facing trafficking charges May 28, 2021 3:30 PM Week-long Thorold-wide food drive kicks off on Monday May 28, 2021 3:02 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News More cases than reported of India-origin variant of concern are probably present in Niagara, says Hirji May 28, 2021 4:38 PM Local resident facing trafficking charges May 28, 2021 3:30 PM Week-long Thorold-wide food drive kicks off on Monday May 28, 2021 3:02 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* More Local News More cases than reported of India-origin variant of concern are probably present in Niagara, says Hirji Local resident facing trafficking charges Week-long Thorold-wide food drive kicks off on Monday Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.15678970152654365,0.3201051872104504,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Work set to begin in Battle of Beaverdams Park - This is what it will look like once project is done (6 Photos) Jun 4, 2021 4:00 PM 'Best choice I ever made,' says Niagara Falls lottery winner of ticket purchase Jun 4, 2021 1:43 PM COVID-19: 12 cases in Niagara today (Friday June 4) Jun 4, 2021 12:38 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News South Main St Bridge in Port Robinson to close permanently Jun 11, 2021 3:00 PM Police seek suspicious man following female joggers in Grimsby Jun 11, 2021 2:51 PM Temporary wage increase for support workers extended until August Jun 11, 2021 2:33 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News South Main St Bridge in Port Robinson to close permanently Jun 11, 2021 3:00 PM Police seek suspicious man following female joggers in Grimsby Jun 11, 2021 2:51 PM Temporary wage increase for support workers extended until August Jun 11, 2021 2:33 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* More Local News 'An accident waiting to happen': West Lincoln council reacts to community centre incident South Main St Bridge in Port Robinson to close permanently Police seek suspicious man following female joggers in Grimsby Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.15094174831016938,0.3218595731753627,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Brock to begin offering COVID vaccines to students Jun 18, 2021 5:00 PM New COVID-19 vaccination clinic dates added Jun 18, 2021 4:16 PM 12 cases of COVID-19 reported in Niagara today (June 18) Jun 18, 2021 1:35 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News From the Thorold Tourism Bureau - to tour guide in Paris Jun 25, 2021 3:21 PM Thorold Legion to hold bottle drive this weekend Jun 25, 2021 1:52 PM Public Health announces new dates to get vaccinated in Niagara Jun 25, 2021 1:39 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News From the Thorold Tourism Bureau - to tour guide in Paris Jun 25, 2021 3:21 PM Thorold Legion to hold bottle drive this weekend Jun 25, 2021 1:52 PM Public Health announces new dates to get vaccinated in Niagara Jun 25, 2021 1:39 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* More Local News From the Thorold Tourism Bureau - to tour guide in Paris Thorold Legion to hold bottle drive this weekend Public Health announces new dates to get vaccinated in Niagara Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.15309601113172544,0.3262001391465677,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Watermain work on St David's Road may cause smelly or cloudy water next week, region warns Jul 2, 2021 3:30 PM Police seize suspected drugs with street value of $60K in Niagara-on-the-Lake traffic stop Jul 2, 2021 2:41 PM Self-educating and speaking out essential for reconciliation, Indigenous lecturer says Jul 2, 2021 2:30 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Watermain work on St David's Road may cause smelly or cloudy water next week, region warns Jul 2, 2021 3:30 PM Police seize suspected drugs with street value of $60K in Niagara-on-the-Lake traffic stop Jul 2, 2021 2:41 PM Self-educating and speaking out essential for reconciliation, Indigenous lecturer says Jul 2, 2021 2:30 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News 41 new affordable housing units to be built in Niagara within a year following federal funding Jul 9, 2021 3:22 PM National conversation needed to reach the unvaccinated, Brock U immunologist says Jul 9, 2021 1:22 PM COVID-19: 3 cases, no deaths in Niagara today Jul 9, 2021 12:34 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News 41 new affordable housing units to be built in Niagara within a year following federal funding Jul 9, 2021 3:22 PM National conversation needed to reach the unvaccinated, Brock U immunologist says Jul 9, 2021 1:22 PM COVID-19: 3 cases, no deaths in Niagara today Jul 9, 2021 12:34 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Senior reported missing in Niagara on the Lake (update: located) Jul 16, 2021 3:07 PM Italo Canadian Centennial Club vandalism under investigation (3 photos) Jul 16, 2021 2:26 PM Environment Canada says there could be some flooding on local roads following heavy rain tonight Jul 16, 2021 2:01 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Veteran Six Nations lacrosse coach named new bench boss for Brock University Badgers Jul 23, 2021 2:55 PM Seymour Hannah vaccination clinic winds down – 3 new cases of COVID-19 in Niagara today Jul 23, 2021 12:41 PM Niagara Casinos opening back up to the public today Jul 23, 2021 11:36 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Veteran Six Nations lacrosse coach named new bench boss for Brock University Badgers Jul 23, 2021 2:55 PM Seymour Hannah vaccination clinic winds down – 3 new cases of COVID-19 in Niagara today Jul 23, 2021 12:41 PM Niagara Casinos opening back up to the public today Jul 23, 2021 11:36 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara athletes bring it all in the Tokyo Olympics Jul 30, 2021 5:14 PM ONTARIO: Capacity limits are out, but masks will stay on after Step 3 of Ontario's reopening Jul 30, 2021 1:57 PM St Catharines Lacrosse showcase planned for August Jul 30, 2021 1:43 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Punk rock flea market kicks off Saturday in Niagara Falls with live music Aug 6, 2021 5:28 PM Local Bed and Breakfast wants to give back to the community by bringing tourists to Thorold Aug 6, 2021 5:10 PM Two facing drug trafficking charges in St. Catharines Aug 6, 2021 4:18 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Punk rock flea market kicks off Saturday in Niagara Falls with live music Aug 6, 2021 5:28 PM Local Bed and Breakfast wants to give back to the community by bringing tourists to Thorold Aug 6, 2021 5:10 PM Two facing drug trafficking charges in St. Catharines Aug 6, 2021 4:18 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News YMCA Niagara looking into opening multiple smaller-scale fitness facilities across the region Aug 13, 2021 3:59 PM Vaccine to be mandatory for federal employees, travellers on commercial airlines, interprovincial trains, cruise ships Aug 13, 2021 3:01 PM West Niagara restaurants face staffing struggles amid reopening Aug 13, 2021 3:00 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News NOTL Horse protesters, carriage operator accuse each other of assault Aug 20, 2021 5:30 PM Emergency repairs will close area roads tomorrow Aug 20, 2021 4:30 PM Even naysayer gets second dose at walk-in vaccine clinic Aug 20, 2021 3:59 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News NOTL Horse protesters, carriage operator accuse each other of assault Aug 20, 2021 5:30 PM Emergency repairs will close area roads tomorrow Aug 20, 2021 4:30 PM Even naysayer gets second dose at walk-in vaccine clinic Aug 20, 2021 3:59 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News NOTL Horse protesters, carriage operator accuse each other of assault Emergency repairs will close area roads tomorrow Even naysayer gets second dose at walk-in vaccine clinic Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.11336580086580085,0.4507034632034632,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* More Local News NOTL Horse protesters, carriage operator accuse each other of assault Emergency repairs will close area roads tomorrow Even naysayer gets second dose at walk-in vaccine clinic Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.14842880333951763,0.323589208410637,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks.

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Police seek suspect in NOTL gas station robbery Aug 27, 2021 2:30 PM Video of group climbing Fallsview Casino rooftop catches attention Aug 27, 2021 2:20 PM Arrest made in Welland sexual assault investigation Aug 27, 2021 2:12 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Ontario legislature prorogued until after federal election Sep 3, 2021 2:41 PM Thorold Anchors hosting the Ontario Provincial Championship this weekend Sep 3, 2021 2:31 PM Ontario reports 807 new COVID cases Friday Sep 3, 2021 10:39 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Ontario legislature prorogued until after federal election Thorold Anchors hosting the Ontario Provincial Championship this weekend Ontario reports 807 new COVID cases Friday Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.12250554323725055,0.4636363636363636,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Multiple break-ins, resulting in over $35K in goods taken, lead to charges for St. Catharines man Sep 10, 2021 5:20 PM Thorold Terry Fox Run back to in-person after virtual year Sep 10, 2021 3:45 PM Long-weekend traffic stops see high number of speeding charges: OPP Sep 10, 2021 3:25 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Multiple break-ins, resulting in over $35K in goods taken, lead to charges for St. Catharines man Sep 10, 2021 5:20 PM Thorold Terry Fox Run back to in-person after virtual year Sep 10, 2021 3:45 PM Long-weekend traffic stops see high number of speeding charges: OPP Sep 10, 2021 3:25 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Multiple break-ins, resulting in over $35K in goods taken, lead to charges for St. Catharines man Thorold Terry Fox Run back to in-person after virtual year Long-weekend traffic stops see high number of speeding charges: OPP Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.11735729386892177,0.4440591966173361,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* More Local News Multiple break-ins, resulting in over $35K in goods taken, lead to charges for St. Catharines man Thorold Terry Fox Run back to in-person after virtual year Long-weekend traffic stops see high number of speeding charges: OPP Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.1508247892458419,0.32080694159641526,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back.

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Running to raise funds for cancer research is a personal quest for Thorold man Sep 17, 2021 2:47 PM Brock Students told to behave ahead of the coming weekend, following wild party around Juneberry Sep 17, 2021 1:20 PM Christmas miracle needed - Thorold Santa Claus Parade on the verge of cancellation Sep 17, 2021 12:26 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Wine expert chooses Brock as home of award-winning Canadian wine collection Firearms, drugs seized during bust at Peace Bridge Local theater company to put on audio drama for one last time Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.11634199134199133,0.44336219336219335,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Fire Prevention in focus this coming week in St Catharines Oct 1, 2021 3:43 PM Project cost swells for downtown Thorold upgrades, staff report says Oct 1, 2021 2:03 PM Long-term care home staff must be double vaxxed by Nov. 15 Oct 1, 2021 1:21 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Fire Prevention in focus this coming week in St Catharines Oct 1, 2021 3:43 PM Project cost swells for downtown Thorold upgrades, staff report says Oct 1, 2021 2:03 PM Long-term care home staff must be double vaxxed by Nov. 15 Oct 1, 2021 1:21 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Fire Prevention in focus this coming week in St Catharines Project cost swells for downtown Thorold upgrades, staff report says Long-term care home staff must be double vaxxed by Nov. 15 Return to ThoroldToday.ca © 2021 ThoroldToday.ca",0.11917960088691795,0.452549889135255,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Ontario lifts capacity limits for concerts, theatres and more Oct 8, 2021 5:02 PM Thorold community advocate looking for locations to host food drive bins next week Oct 8, 2021 2:28 PM Arrest made in stolen statue investigation Oct 8, 2021 1:09 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.
