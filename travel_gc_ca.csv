For example: standards of hygiene and sanitation may be different safe food and clean water may be unavailable climate or environmental conditions may support certain diseases that do not (or rarely) occur in Canada The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) actively seeks to identify and evaluate information about new, unusual or rapidly evolving health risks. When necessary, PHAC releases Travel Health Notices outlining the potential risks to Canadian travellers and to the Canadian public, and recommends measures that can be taken to help reduce these risks. Level 1 - Practise usual precautions Travel health notices advise practising usual travel health precautions. For example, notices at this level may remind travellers about routine vaccinations, highlight the importance of hand washing, or recommend protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Level 2 - Practise special precautions Travel health notices recommend that travellers practise special health precautions, such as receiving additional vaccinations. A notice at this level would be issued if there is an outbreak in a limited geographic location, a newly identified disease in the region or a change in the existing pattern of disease. Level 3 - Avoid non-essential travel Travel health notices include a warning to avoid non-essential travel in order to protect the health of Canadian travellers and the Canadian public. The notice outlines specific precautions to take when visiting the region and what to do if you become ill during or after travel. A notice at this level would be issued during a large-scale outbreak in a large geographic area, or if there is increased risk to the traveller and an increased risk of spreading disease to other groups including the Canadian public. Level 4 - Avoid all travel Advises travellers to avoid all travel in order to protect the health of the Canadian public. A notice at this level would be issued if there is a high risk of spread of disease to the general public regardless of measures taken while travelling. Avoiding travel will limit the spread of the disease in Canada and internationally.

For example: standards of hygiene and sanitation may be different safe food and clean water may be unavailable climate or environmental conditions may support certain diseases that do not (or rarely) occur in Canada The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) actively seeks to identify and evaluate information about new, unusual or rapidly evolving health risks. When necessary, PHAC releases Travel Health Notices outlining the potential risks to Canadian travellers and to the Canadian public, and recommends measures that can be taken to help reduce these risks. Level 1 - Practise usual precautions Travel health notices advise practising usual travel health precautions. For example, notices at this level may remind travellers about routine vaccinations, highlight the importance of hand washing, or recommend protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Level 2 - Practise special precautions Travel health notices recommend that travellers practise special health precautions, such as receiving additional vaccinations. A notice at this level would be issued if there is an outbreak in a limited geographic location, a newly identified disease in the region or a change in the existing pattern of disease. Level 3 - Avoid non-essential travel Travel health notices include a warning to avoid non-essential travel in order to protect the health of Canadian travellers and the Canadian public. The notice outlines specific precautions to take when visiting the region and what to do if you become ill during or after travel. A notice at this level would be issued during a large-scale outbreak in a large geographic area, or if there is increased risk to the traveller and an increased risk of spreading disease to other groups including the Canadian public. Level 4 - Avoid all travel Advises travellers to avoid all travel in order to protect the health of the Canadian public. A notice at this level would be issued if there is a high risk of spread of disease to the general public regardless of measures taken while travelling. Avoiding travel will limit the spread of the disease in Canada and internationally.

For example: standards of hygiene and sanitation may be different safe food and clean water may be unavailable climate or environmental conditions may support certain diseases that do not (or rarely) occur in Canada The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) actively seeks to identify and evaluate information about new, unusual or rapidly evolving health risks. When necessary, PHAC releases Travel Health Notices outlining the potential risks to Canadian travellers and to the Canadian public, and recommends measures that can be taken to help reduce these risks. Level 1 - Practise usual precautions Travel health notices advise practising usual travel health precautions. For example, notices at this level may remind travellers about routine vaccinations, highlight the importance of hand washing, or recommend protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Level 2 - Practise special precautions Travel health notices recommend that travellers practise special health precautions, such as receiving additional vaccinations. A notice at this level would be issued if there is an outbreak in a limited geographic location, a newly identified disease in the region or a change in the existing pattern of disease. Level 3 - Avoid non-essential travel Travel health notices include a warning to avoid non-essential travel in order to protect the health of Canadian travellers and the Canadian public. The notice outlines specific precautions to take when visiting the region and what to do if you become ill during or after travel. A notice at this level would be issued during a large-scale outbreak in a large geographic area, or if there is increased risk to the traveller and an increased risk of spreading disease to other groups including the Canadian public. Level 4 - Avoid all travel Advises travellers to avoid all travel in order to protect the health of the Canadian public. A notice at this level would be issued if there is a high risk of spread of disease to the general public regardless of measures taken while travelling. Avoiding travel will limit the spread of the disease in Canada and internationally.

Follow the instructions of local authorities, including those related to physical distancing Avoid crowded areas Useful links: Presidency of the Dominican Republic (in Spanish) Dominican Republic Public Health Agency (in Spanish) Crime Crime occurs in the Dominican Republic, including violent crime, especially in major cities. However, most incidents are opportunistic crime which is the most significant threat for tourists. Petty crime Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching, occurs throughout the country. Tourists are common targets for theft. Crime tends to rise during holiday periods. Incidents occur: at resorts at beaches at airports at bus stations on public transportation Theft also occurs from all-inclusive hotel rooms and from hotel room safes, as well as from cars, particularly rentals. Drive-by robberies, where thieves on motorcycles, scooters or bicycles grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians, occur frequently. Thieves may even reach into vehicles, including taxis, stopped at red lights to steal belongings. Theft of items from checked baggage at airports has been reported. These thefts have taken place most frequently when travellers are departing. Money and personal items have also been stolen from carry-on luggage while travellers are going through security checks. All bags are routinely X-rayed upon arrival and departure. Be wary of individuals who ask for directions or who try to be too helpful Watch out for hustlers selling various wares, particularly in Santo Domingo Stay at hotels or resorts with good security Be wary of anyone who tries to enter your room Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times Avoid carrying your bag slung over your shoulder Carry only small amounts of money and avoid showing signs of affluence Keep electronic devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops and cameras out of sight Keep car doors locked, windows up and your belongings out of sight Don’t pack valuables in your checked luggage Verify that your luggage has not been tampered with before you check in at the airport Assault Violent crime against foreigners, including assault, occasionally occurs. Incidents take place mainly in large cities, at night or early morning. Some have been targeted in armed robberies when travelling to the Las Américas International Airport, sometimes in taxis. Arrange your arrival to and departure from the Dominican Republic in daylight hours Use the taxi service authorized by the airport Avoid unmarked taxis, especially in Santo Domingo Keep car doors locked and windows up, especially at a traffic light Avoid walking alone in unpopulated areas and unpatrolled beaches after dark If threatened by robbers, don’t resist Security forces are understaffed and underequipped. The police are often unable to respond in a timely manner to calls for assistance. Scams Criminals impersonating police officers will stop vehicles and ask foreign drivers for payment of fines for made-up offences. Regulations require police to wear a nametag with their last name. You have the right to ask police for identification. If Dominican police stop you for a traffic violation: request a traffic ticket don’t pay the ticket on the spot Rogue lawyers Rogue lawyers are a problem in tourist areas, particularly in Punta Cana. These lawyers stand near the tourist police (CESTUR) station and try to recruit desperate foreigners, brought to the station for detention purposes, as clients. Then, they try to extort excessive amounts of money from them by offering legal representation or assistance getting out of jail. Fraud Credit card and ATM fraud and cloning are significant concerns. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards: pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements More about overseas fraud Spiked food and drinks Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Women’s safety Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreigners have occurred, including at beach resorts. In some cases, hotel employees have been implicated. Exercise caution when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances Be wary of rides or other invitations Avoid taking public transportation or walking alone at night If you are a victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you should report it immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy. You should also file a report with Dominican authorities. No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint to Dominican authorities before departing the country. Safe-travel guide for women Demonstrations and strikes Demonstrations take place from time to time throughout the country, particularly in Santo Domingo. Demonstrations have largely been peaceful and have not affected tourist areas, although local travel outside resorts could be affected. Labour strikes occur frequently in the town of Higuey, near Punta Cana, and may affect hotel service. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place Follow the instructions of local authorities Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations More about mass gatherings (large-scale events) Power outages The power infrastructure is unreliable and lacks maintenance. Power outages are frequent although they mainly occur in poor neighbourhoods of major urban areas. Recreational activities Sporting and aquatic equipment may not meet Canadian safety standards. If engaging in recreational activities: ensure that equipment is safe and in good condition ensure helmets and life jackets are available before undertaking extreme or eco-tourism activities, ensure that businesses offering excursions follow proper safety measures avoid excursions that are not offered by tour operators avoid participating in any water activities when you are under the influence of alcohol or other substances check that your travel insurance covers accidents related to recreational activities Water safety Coastal waters can be dangerous. Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Water safety abroad Road safety The Dominican Republic has one of the highest road accident rates in the world. Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Although major highways connecting cities and tourist areas are generally in good condition, most secondary roads, are poorly maintained and poorly lit. Marked lanes are lacking. There are vehicles travelling in the wrong direction. Traffic is congested due to the significant number of trucks and motorcycles. Pedestrians don’t have the right of way, even at traffic lights. Drivers don’t respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds, and are extremely aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is prevalent. Many vehicles are in poor condition and don’t have working headlights or mirrors. Military and police road blocks are common, especially in areas near the Haitian border. Don’t drive after dark Be especially cautious if you need to drive during holiday periods, such as Christmas or Easter Take extra care when walking, particularly in Santo Domingo Scooters The number of moped and scooter accidents involving tourists is increasing. If renting a scooter or moped: be vigilant while driving avoid renting from operators who don’t provide a helmet with the rental avoid driving on roads in disrepair Border with Haiti The border areas between the Dominican Republic and Haiti may be tense at times and incidents can lead to violence. Border crossing points often close without notice. If travelling by car to Haiti: remain particularly vigilant expect long queues and delays Public transportation Buses Private companies operate reliable buses between cities. Avoid public buses and gua-guas – microbuses – which often don’t have doors. Taxis Taxis are not metered. Upon arrival to the Dominican Republic, use the taxi service authorized by the airport.

Practise safe food and water precautions while travelling in the Caribbean. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it! Cholera Risk Cholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk. To protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions. Travellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those: visiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation visiting areas where outbreaks are occurring Vaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional. Travellers' diarrhea Travellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling. Typhoid Typhoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time. Travellers visiting regions with a risk typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation should speak to a health care professional about vaccination. Insects Insects and Illness In some areas in the Caribbean, certain insects carry and spread diseases like chikungunya, dengue fever, malaria, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Travellers are advised to take precautions against bites. Chikungunya There is currently a risk of chikungunya in this country. Chikungunya is a virus spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Chikungunya can cause a viral disease that typically causes fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years. Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times. There is no vaccine available for chikungunya. Dengue In this country, dengue fever is a risk to travellers year-round. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites. Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal. The level of risk of dengue fever changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. After a decline in reported dengue cases worldwide in 2017 and 2018, global numbers have been steeply rising again. Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset. Protect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever. Zika Virus Zika virus is a risk in this country. Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects. Pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy should visit a health care professional before travelling to discuss the potential risks of travelling to this country. Pregnant women may choose to avoid or postpone travel to this country. Travel recommendations: Prevent mosquito bites at all times. If you are pregnant, always use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact with anyone who has travelled to this country for the duration of your pregnancy. Women: Wait 2 months after travel to this country or after onset of illness due to Zika virus (whichever is longer) before trying for a pregnancy. If your male partner travelled with you, wait 3 months after travel or after onset of illness due to Zika virus (whichever is longer).

Antimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. See a health care provider or visit a travel health clinic, preferably six weeks before you travel to discuss your options. Animals Animals and Illness Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats. Some infections found in some areas in the Caribbean, like rabies, can be shared between humans and animals. Person-to-Person Person-to-Person Infections Crowded conditions can increase your risk of certain illnesses. Remember to wash your hands often and practice proper cough and sneeze etiquette to avoid colds, the flu and other illnesses. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV are spread through blood and bodily fluids; practise safer sex. HIV HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). High risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs. For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low. Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional. High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives. Medical services and facilities COVID-19 - Testing facilities Consult the following links to find out where you can get a COVID-19 test: Local COVID-19 testing facilities - Government of the Dominican Republic Quality of care varies greatly throughout the country. Good health care is generally available only in major cities. Private hospitals and clinics are better equipped than public ones. However, there are reports of overcharging for medical services, variable pricing and unnecessary overnight hospital stays at private facilities. Beware of aggressive sales tactics of in-house resort doctors, who are often contracted out by private hospitals and try to sell you on their facility. If you go to the hospital: inquire about fees prior to undergoing treatment let the hospital administrators know if you feel you have been overcharged after a visit request assistance in English or French from the hospital’s guest services desk Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

For example: standards of hygiene and sanitation may be different safe food and clean water may be unavailable climate or environmental conditions may support certain diseases that do not (or rarely) occur in Canada The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) actively seeks to identify and evaluate information about new, unusual or rapidly evolving health risks. When necessary, PHAC releases Travel Health Notices outlining the potential risks to Canadian travellers and to the Canadian public, and recommends measures that can be taken to help reduce these risks. Level 1 - Practise usual precautions Travel health notices advise practising usual travel health precautions. For example, notices at this level may remind travellers about routine vaccinations, highlight the importance of hand washing, or recommend protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Level 2 - Practise special precautions Travel health notices recommend that travellers practise special health precautions, such as receiving additional vaccinations. A notice at this level would be issued if there is an outbreak in a limited geographic location, a newly identified disease in the region or a change in the existing pattern of disease. Level 3 - Avoid non-essential travel Travel health notices include a warning to avoid non-essential travel in order to protect the health of Canadian travellers and the Canadian public. The notice outlines specific precautions to take when visiting the region and what to do if you become ill during or after travel. A notice at this level would be issued during a large-scale outbreak in a large geographic area, or if there is increased risk to the traveller and an increased risk of spreading disease to other groups including the Canadian public. Level 4 - Avoid all travel Advises travellers to avoid all travel in order to protect the health of the Canadian public. A notice at this level would be issued if there is a high risk of spread of disease to the general public regardless of measures taken while travelling. Avoiding travel will limit the spread of the disease in Canada and internationally.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is continuing to advise travellers to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Advice provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to be re-evaluated based on the evolving situation in Canada and in other countries. Many foreign governments continue to implement strict travel restrictions and international transportation options continue to be less available. As a result, you may have difficulty returning to Canada, or may have to remain abroad for an indeterminate period. Local authorities abroad may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantine. In some countries, travellers may have limited access to timely and appropriate health care should they become ill. The Government of Canada's Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act requires persons entering Canada by air, land or sea to isolate for 14 days if they have symptoms of COVID-19, or to quarantine for 14 days if they are asymptomatic to limit the spread of COVID-19. Travel to Canada is also currently being restricted for all foreign nationals coming from any country. These restrictions prohibit foreign nationals, including U.S. nationals, from entering Canada for discretionary (optional) travel purposes. Exemptions to the prohibition exist for certain groups of foreign nationals, for example, temporary foreign workers and persons delivering urgent medical supplies, as long as they do not exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. About COVID-19 COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Some coronaviruses can cause no or mild illness, like the common cold, but other coronaviruses can cause severe illness, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent evidence indicates that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who: have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person, and may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include: new or worsening cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing temperature equal to or over 38oC or feeling feverish chills fatigue or weakness muscle or body aches new loss of smell or taste headache gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting) feeling very unwell Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes. Older people and those with a compromised immune system or underlying medical condition(s) are at a higher risk of developing severe disease. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Most people with mild illness will recover on their own. Recommendations for travellers Do not travel if you are sick or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the past 14 days. If you are well and must travel, it is important to be aware of the risks involved. Follow precautions recommended by local government, public health authority and transportation system officials. Travel insurance may be difficult to obtain and may not offer coverage for COVID-19 related medical treatment. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. During your trip: Self-isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Be aware of the local COVID-19 situation and follow local public health advice. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Take precautions against respiratory illnesses. Avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close contact. Avoid non-essential gatherings. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Keep a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others. In situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain, wear a non-medical mask or face covering. All travellers are reminded to follow the health precautions listed below. Wash your hands: Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Wear a non-medical mask or face covering: To protect yourself and others, wear a non-medical mask or face covering when: you're in shared indoor spaces; you can't maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others; advised by the local public health authority. Monitor your health: If you become sick when you are travelling, avoid contact with others. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Travelling back to Canada: Do not travel if you become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 prior to your planned return to Canada or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the past 14 days. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc) you may need to make. Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding. In the event that the air operator observes that the air traveller has COVID-19 symptoms, the air operator will be required to refuse to board the person for travel for a period of 14 days or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the symptoms that the person is exhibiting are not related to COVID-19. Measures requiring all air passengers to have a non-medical mask or face covering to cover their mouth and nose during travel are in effect. Some airlines may conduct a temperature check prior to boarding. If you do not have a non-medical mask or face covering, you won't be allowed to enter the restricted areas of the airport and continue with your journey. When travelling by air, travellers will be asked to wear the non-medical mask or face covering: at the security screening checkpoints at the boarding gate during the flight when you can't physically distance from others when required by an airline employee, a public health official, staff from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, or a Canada Border Services Agency officer If you feel sick or experience any symptoms of COVID-19 during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, you must inform the flight attendant or a Canada Border Services Agent immediately. If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada Border Services Agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada Border Services Agent will provide instructions for you to follow. Upon return to Canada: The Government of Canada has put in place an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. The purpose of this Order is to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Compliance with this Order is subject to verification and enforcement. Those in violation may face detention in a quarantine facility as well as fines and/or imprisonment. Travellers require non-medical masks or face coverings upon arrival in Canada. Travellers can also wear homemade cloth face coverings. Ensure you have a suitable place of quarantine/isolation that has access to the necessities of life and is not shared with those at risk of more severe disease. Do not quarantine or isolate in places you can't separate yourself from those who live with you. For example: in a group or communal living setting; in a household with large families or many people; in a shared a small apartment, or have roommates who have not travelled with you; or at a camp, student dorm or other group setting where there is close contact and shared common spaces. It is expected that most travellers will quarantine in their own home or in the same place they are visiting in Canada. If this is not possible, travellers are responsible for making alternative arrangements for quarantine accommodations that are within their own financial means. A traveller may be transferred to a federal designated quarantine facility if it is deemed necessary by a public health officer designated under the Quarantine Act, and only if travellers are confirmed to have no other suitable quarantine or isolation options available. This measure is used as a last resort. Travellers can use the ArriveCAN app to speed up the arrival process in Canada and to spend less time with border and public health officers. Information can be submitted easily and securely using the app within 48 hours before arriving in Canada. Travellers entering Canada must: provide traveller contact information through: the ArriveCAN mobile app (iOS or Android) or an accessible web-based form, or a paper form undergo screening by a border official answer any relevant questions: upon arrival in Canada during the 14-day period while in quarantine or isolation Travellers with symptoms: mandatory isolation If you have recently returned to Canada and you have symptoms, you must ISOLATE. This is mandatory. If required, immediate medical attention will be provided upon arrival in Canada. You MUST isolate without delay. Go directly to the place where you will isolate, without delay, and stay there for 14 days from the date you arrived in Canada. Wear a suitable non-medical mask or facial covering while travelling to the place of isolation Practise physical distancing at all times. Do not take public transportation. Use private transportation only. Avoid contact with others while in transit. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, report your symptoms daily until the end of your 14-day isolation through: the ArriveCAN app; online at https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca; or by calling 1-833-641-0343. If your symptoms get worse: immediately call your local public health authority and follow their instructions. Travellers without symptoms: mandatory quarantine If you have recently returned to Canada and you have no symptoms, you must QUARANTINE. This is mandatory. You are at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others. This means you MUST: Go directly to your place of quarantine, without delay, and stay there for 14 days from the date you arrived in Canada. Wear a suitable mask or facial covering while in transit. Practise physical distancing at all times. Use private transportation such as private vehicle to reach your place of quarantine, if possible. Avoid contact with others while in transit. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, report symptoms (if any) daily until the end of your 14-day quarantine through: the ArriveCAN app; online at https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca; or by calling 1-833-641-0343 If you develop symptoms within 14 days: immediately isolate yourself from others; immediately call a health care professional or your local public health authority and follow their instructions. Some provinces and territories have additional travel restrictions. Some examples of additional travel restrictions may include: prohibiting non-essential travel into the province limited access to certain regions within the province Please refer to the list of provincial and territorial websites for more information. Note that travellers may also be contacted by provincial/territorial authorities throughout their 14-day quarantine/isolation. If federal and provincial/territorial guidelines differ, travellers should follow the most precautionary and stringent requirements. As the continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to COVID-19, there are some exemptions to the order to quarantine for classes oftravellers who perform an essential job or function. If you don't have symptoms of COVID-19 and you're a member of one of the exempt classes of persons listed in the mandatory isolation order, then you are exempt from federal quarantine requirements, however still required to respect the intent of the order in addition to any provincial and local requirements.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is continuing to advise travellers to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel to the United Kingdom (UK) or South Africa. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in these countries. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand this variant, its impacts, and the possibility of international spread. Passengers who arrive in Canada from the United Kingdom or South Africa will be subject to secondary screening and enhanced measures, including increased scrutiny of quarantine plans. Additionally, due to the identification of the variant in the UK, the Government of Canada has suspended entry into Canada of all commercial and private passenger flights from the United Kingdom until January 6, 2021, at 11:59 PM EST. This advice provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to be re-evaluated based on the evolving situation in Canada and in other countries. Many foreign governments continue to implement strict travel restrictions and international transportation options continue to be less available. As a result, you may have difficulty returning to Canada, or may have to remain abroad for an indeterminate period. Local authorities abroad may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantine. In some countries, travellers may have limited access to timely and appropriate health care should they become ill. The Government of Canada's Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act requires persons entering Canada by air, land or sea to isolate for 14 days if they have symptoms of COVID-19, or to quarantine for 14 days if they are asymptomatic to limit the spread of COVID-19. Travel to Canada is also currently being restricted for all foreign nationals coming from any country. These restrictions prohibit foreign nationals, including U.S. nationals, from entering Canada for discretionary (optional) travel purposes. Exemptions to the prohibition exist for certain groups of foreign nationals, for example, temporary foreign workers and persons delivering urgent medical supplies, as long as they do not exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. About COVID-19 COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Some coronaviruses can cause no or mild illness, like the common cold, but other coronaviruses can cause severe illness, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent evidence indicates that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who: have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person, and may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include: new or worsening cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing temperature equal to or over 38oC or feeling feverish chills fatigue or weakness muscle or body aches new loss of smell or taste headache gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting) feeling very unwell Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes. Older people and those with a compromised immune system or underlying medical condition(s) are at a higher risk of developing severe disease. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Most people with mild illness will recover on their own. Recommendations for travellers Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel, it is important to be aware of the risks involved. Follow precautions recommended by local government, public health authority and transportation system officials. Travel insurance may be difficult to obtain and may not offer coverage for COVID-19 related medical treatment. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. During your trip: Self-isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Be aware of the local COVID-19 situation and follow local public health advice. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Take precautions against respiratory illnesses. Avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close contact. Avoid non-essential gatherings. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Keep a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others. In situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain, wear a non-medical mask. All travellers are reminded to follow the health precautions listed below. Wash your hands: Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Wear a non-medical mask: To protect yourself and others, wear a non-medical mask when: you're in shared indoor spaces; you can't maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others; advised by the local public health authority. Monitor your health: If you become sick when you are travelling, avoid contact with others. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Travelling back to Canada: Do not travel if you: become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, even if mild, prior to your planned return to Canada have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc) you may need to make. Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding. In the event that the air operator observes that the air traveller has COVID-19 symptoms, the air operator will be required to refuse to board the person for travel for a period of 14 days or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the symptoms that the person is exhibiting are not related to COVID-19. Measures requiring all air passengers to have a non-medical mask to cover their mouth and nose during travel are in effect. Some airlines may conduct a temperature check prior to boarding. If you do not have a non-medical mask, you won't be allowed to enter the restricted areas of the airport and continue with your journey. When travelling by air, travellers will be asked to wear the non-medical mask: at the security screening checkpoints at the boarding gate during the flight when you can't physically distance from others when required by an airline employee, a public health official, staff from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, or a Canada Border Services Agency officer If you feel sick or experience any symptoms of COVID-19 during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, you must inform the flight attendant or a Canada Border Services Agent immediately. If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada Border Services Agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada Border Services Agent will provide instructions for you to follow. Upon return to Canada: The Government of Canada has put in place an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. The purpose of this Order is to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Compliance with this Order is subject to verification and enforcement. Those in violation may face detention in a quarantine facility as well as fines and/or imprisonment. Travellers require non-medical masks upon arrival in Canada. Travellers can also wear homemade non-medical masks. Ensure you have a suitable place of quarantine/isolation that has access to the necessities of life and is not shared with those at risk of more severe disease. Do not quarantine or isolate in places you can't separate yourself from those who live with you. For example: in a group or communal living setting; in a household with large families or many people; in a shared a small apartment, or have roommates who have not travelled with you; or at a camp, student dorm or other group setting where there is close contact and shared common spaces. It is expected that most travellers will quarantine in their own home or in the same place they are visiting in Canada. If this is not possible, travellers are responsible for making alternative arrangements for quarantine accommodations that are within their own financial means. A traveller may be transferred to a federal designated quarantine facility if it is deemed necessary by a public health officer designated under the Quarantine Act, and only if travellers are confirmed to have no other suitable quarantine or isolation options available. This measure is used as a last resort. Use ArriveCAN to speed up your arrival process in Canada and spend less time with border and public health officers. Submit your information easily and securely before arriving in Canada. Travellers entering Canada must: provide a suitable quarantine plan, civic address and information on where you can be contacted during your quarantine period undergo screening by a border official answer any relevant questions: when you arrive in Canada during your 14-day period while in quarantine or isolation as of November 21, 2020 submit your information digitally through ArriveCAN before you board your flight to Canada report your arrival at your place of quarantine or isolation within 48 hours of entering Canada using ArriveCAN or by calling the 1-833-641-0343 toll-free number if you do not have symptoms and are not exempt from mandatory quarantine you must report your symptoms daily using ArriveCAN or by calling the 1-833-641-0343 toll free number Travellers with symptoms: mandatory isolation If you have recently returned to Canada and you have symptoms, you must ISOLATE. This is mandatory. If required, immediate medical attention will be provided upon arrival in Canada. You MUST isolate without delay. Go directly to the place where you will isolate, without delay, and stay there for 14 days from the date you arrived in Canada. Wear a suitable non-medical mask while travelling to the place of isolation Practise physical distancing at all times. Do not take public transportation. Use private transportation only.

Some provinces and territories have additional travel restrictions. Some examples of additional travel restrictions may include: prohibiting non-essential travel into the province limited access to certain regions within the province Please refer to the list of provincial and territorial websites for more information. Note that travellers may also be contacted by provincial/territorial authorities throughout their 14-day quarantine/isolation. If federal and provincial/territorial guidelines differ, travellers should follow the most precautionary and stringent requirements. As the continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to COVID-19, there are some exemptions to the order to quarantine for classes oftravellers who perform an essential job or function. If you don't have symptoms of COVID-19 and you're a member of one of the exempt classes of persons listed in the mandatory isolation order, then you are exempt from federal quarantine requirements, however still required to respect the intent of the order in addition to any provincial and local requirements.

The Government of Canada's Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act requires persons entering Canada by air, land or sea to isolate for 14 days if they have symptoms of COVID-19, or to quarantine for 14 days if they are asymptomatic to limit the spread of COVID-19. Travel to Canada is also currently being restricted for all foreign nationals coming from any country. These restrictions prohibit foreign nationals, including U.S. nationals, from entering Canada for discretionary (optional) travel purposes. Exemptions to the prohibition exist for certain groups of foreign nationals, for example, temporary foreign workers and persons delivering urgent medical supplies, as long as they do not exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. About COVID-19 COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Some coronaviruses can cause no or mild illness, like the common cold, but other coronaviruses can cause severe illness, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Evidence indicates that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who: have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person, and may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include: new or worsening cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing temperature equal to or over 38oC or feeling feverish chills fatigue or weakness muscle or body aches new loss of smell or taste headache gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting) feeling very unwell Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes. Older people and those with a compromised immune system or underlying medical condition(s) are at a higher risk of developing severe disease. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Most people with mild illness will recover on their own. Recommendations for travellers Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel, it is important to be aware of the risks involved. Follow precautions recommended by local government, public health authority and transportation system officials. Travel insurance may be difficult to obtain and may not offer coverage for COVID-19 related medical treatment. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. During your trip: Self-isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Be aware of the local COVID-19 situation and follow local public health advice. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Take precautions against respiratory illnesses. Avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close contact. Avoid non-essential gatherings. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Keep a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others. In situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain, wear a non-medical mask. All travellers are reminded to follow the health precautions listed below. Wash your hands: Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Wear a non-medical mask: To protect yourself and others, wear a non-medical mask when: you're in shared indoor spaces; you can't maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others; advised by the local public health authority. Monitor your health: If you become sick when you are travelling, avoid contact with others. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Travelling back to Canada: Do not travel if you: become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, even if mild, prior to your planned return to Canada have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc) you may need to make. Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding. In the event that the air operator observes that the air traveller has COVID-19 symptoms, the air operator will be required to refuse to board the person for travel for a period of 14 days or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the symptoms that the person is exhibiting are not related to COVID-19. Measures requiring all air passengers to have a non-medical mask to cover their mouth and nose during travel are in effect. Some airlines may conduct a temperature check prior to boarding. If you do not have a non-medical mask, you won't be allowed to enter the restricted areas of the airport and continue with your journey. When travelling by air, travellers will be asked to wear the non-medical mask: at the security screening checkpoints at the boarding gate during the flight when you can't physically distance from others when required by an airline employee, a public health official, staff from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, or a Canada Border Services Agency officer If you feel sick or experience any symptoms of COVID-19 during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, you must inform the flight attendant or a Canada Border Services Agent immediately. If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada Border Services Agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada Border Services Agent will provide instructions for you to follow. Upon return to Canada: The Government of Canada has put in place an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. The purpose of this Order is to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Compliance with this Order is subject to verification and enforcement. Those in violation may face detention in a quarantine facility as well as fines and/or imprisonment. Travellers require non-medical masks upon arrival in Canada. Travellers can also wear homemade non-medical masks. Ensure you have a suitable place of quarantine/isolation that has access to the necessities of life and is not shared with those at risk of more severe disease. Do not quarantine or isolate in places you can't separate yourself from those who live with you. For example: in a group or communal living setting; in a household with large families or many people; in a shared a small apartment, or have roommates who have not travelled with you; or at a camp, student dorm or other group setting where there is close contact and shared common spaces. It is expected that most travellers will quarantine in their own home or in the same place they are visiting in Canada. If this is not possible, travellers are responsible for making alternative arrangements for quarantine accommodations that are within their own financial means. A traveller may be transferred to a federal designated quarantine facility if it is deemed necessary by a public health officer designated under the Quarantine Act, and only if travellers are confirmed to have no other suitable quarantine or isolation options available. This measure is used as a last resort. Use ArriveCAN to speed up your arrival process in Canada and spend less time with border and public health officers. Submit your information easily and securely before arriving in Canada. Travellers entering Canada must: provide a suitable quarantine plan, civic address and information on where you can be contacted during your quarantine period undergo screening by a border official answer any relevant questions: when you arrive in Canada during your 14-day period while in quarantine or isolation as of November 21, 2020 submit your information digitally through ArriveCAN before you board your flight to Canada report your arrival at your place of quarantine or isolation within 48 hours of entering Canada using ArriveCAN or by calling the 1-833-641-0343 toll-free number if you do not have symptoms and are not exempt from mandatory quarantine you must report your symptoms daily using ArriveCAN or by calling the 1-833-641-0343 toll free number Travellers with symptoms: mandatory isolation If you have recently returned to Canada and you have symptoms, you must ISOLATE. This is mandatory. If required, immediate medical attention will be provided upon arrival in Canada. You MUST isolate without delay. Go directly to the place where you will isolate, without delay, and stay there for 14 days from the date you arrived in Canada. Wear a suitable non-medical mask while travelling to the place of isolation Practise physical distancing at all times. Do not take public transportation. Use private transportation only.

Note that travellers may also be contacted by provincial/territorial authorities throughout their 14-day quarantine/isolation. If federal and provincial or territorial guidelines differ, you should follow the strictest requirements. As the continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to COVID-19, there are some exemptions to the order to quarantine for classes oftravellers who perform an essential job or function. If you don't have symptoms of COVID-19 and you're a member of one of the exempt classes of persons listed in the mandatory isolation order, then you are exempt from federal quarantine requirements, however still required to respect the intent of the order in addition to any provincial and local requirements.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is continuing to advise travellers to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders will also be required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Additional measures will take effect on February 22, 2021 for COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and mandatory 3-night hotel stays at a government-authorized hotel. The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. Passengers who arrive in Canada from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil will be subject to secondary screening and enhanced measures, including increased scrutiny of quarantine plans. This advice provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to be re-evaluated based on the evolving situation in Canada and in other countries. Many foreign governments continue to implement strict travel restrictions and international transportation options continue to be less available. As a result, you may have difficulty returning to Canada, or may have to remain abroad for an indeterminate period. Local authorities abroad may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantine. In some countries, travellers may have limited access to timely and appropriate health care should they become ill.

NEW TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS: Effective February 22, 2021, new requirements related to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and a mandatory stay of up to 3 nights at a government-authorized accommodation will come into effect for air travellers. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Before you travel: Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel: Plan where you will obtain a COVID-19 molecular test in your destination prior to returning to Canada. Pre-book a 3-night stay at a government authorized accommodation prior to your return to Canada. Verify that you can meet your destination country's entry requirements Consult the Travel Advice and Advisories page, and select your destination. Information on entry/exit requirements can be found under the 'Entry/exit requirements' tab. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. Check with your travel insurance provider and make sure you are covered for COVID-19-related medical expenses, other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses, as well as trip interruption. Make sure you meet requirements to board a flight in Canada. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make. During your travel: Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices: Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting non-medical mask when recommended, such as when: you're in shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that you frequently touch.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. NEW TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS: Effective February 22, 2021, new requirements related to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and a mandatory stay of up to 3 nights at a government-authorized accommodation will come into effect for air travellers. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Before you travel: Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel: Plan where you will obtain a COVID-19 molecular test in your destination prior to returning to Canada. Pre-book a 3-night stay at a government authorized accommodation prior to your return to Canada. Verify that you can meet your destination country's entry requirements Consult the Travel Advice and Advisories page, and select your destination. Information on entry/exit requirements can be found under the 'Entry/exit requirements' tab. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. Check with your travel insurance provider and make sure you are covered for COVID-19-related medical expenses, other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses, as well as trip interruption. Make sure you meet requirements to board a flight in Canada. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make. During your travel: Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices: Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting non-medical mask when recommended, such as when: you're in shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that you frequently touch.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. NEW TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS: Effective March 30, 2021, all travellers who have been in Brazil within 14 days before the day on which they seek entry into Canada will be subject to enhanced screening measures, including increased scrutiny of quarantine plans and rigorous monitoring to ensure compliance with quarantine measures. Requirements related to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and a mandatory stay of up to 3 nights at a government-authorized accommodation are in effect for air travellers. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Before you travel: Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel: Plan where you will obtain a COVID-19 molecular test in your destination prior to returning to Canada. Pre-book a 3-night stay at a government authorized accommodation prior to your return to Canada. Verify that you can meet your destination country's entry requirements Consult the Travel Advice and Advisories page, and select your destination. Information on entry/exit requirements can be found under the 'Entry/exit requirements' tab. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. Check with your travel insurance provider and make sure you are covered for COVID-19-related medical expenses, other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses, as well as trip interruption. Make sure you meet requirements to board a flight in Canada. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make. During your travel: Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices: Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting non-medical mask when recommended, such as when: you're in shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that you frequently touch.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. NEW TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS: The Government of Canada has suspended entry into Canada of all commercial and private passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days, effective 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021. Passengers who depart India or Pakistan to Canada after 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021, via an indirect route, will need to obtain a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada. Requirements related to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and a mandatory stay of up to 3 nights at a government-authorized accommodation are in effect for air travellers. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Before you travel: Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel: Plan where you will obtain a COVID-19 molecular test in your destination prior to returning to Canada. Pre-book a 3-night stay at a government authorized accommodation prior to your return to Canada. Verify that you can meet your destination country's entry requirements Consult the Travel Advice and Advisories page, and select your destination. Information on entry/exit requirements can be found under the 'Entry/exit requirements' tab. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. Check with your travel insurance provider and make sure you are covered for COVID-19-related medical expenses, other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses, as well as trip interruption. Make sure you meet requirements to board a flight in Canada. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make. During your travel: Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices: Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting non-medical mask when recommended, such as when: you're in shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that you frequently touch. Travelling back to Canada: Do not travel if you: become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, even if mild, prior to your planned return to Canada have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding. In the event that the air operator observes that the air traveller has COVID-19 symptoms, the air operator will be required to refuse to board the person for travel for a period of 14 days or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the symptoms that the person is exhibiting are not related to COVID-19. If flying to Canada as a final destination, all travellers including Canadians must use ArriveCAN before they board their flight to Canada to submit their: travel and contact information quarantine plan (unless exempted from the mandatory requirement to quarantine) COVID-19 symptom self-assessments Measures requiring all air passengers to have a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn non-medical mask to cover their mouth, nose, and chin during travel are in effect. Some airlines may conduct a temperature check prior to boarding. If you do not have a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn non-medical mask, you won't be allowed to enter the restricted areas of the airport and continue with your journey. When travelling by air, travellers will be asked to properly wear a well-constructed, well-fitting non-medical mask: at the security screening checkpoints at the boarding gate during the flight when required by an airline employee, staff from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, or a Government of Canada screening or quarantine officer If you feel sick or experience any symptoms of COVID-19 during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, you must inform the flight attendant or a Government of Canada screening or quarantine officer immediately. If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, report this information to a screening or quarantine officer on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The screening or quarantine officer will provide instructions for you to follow. Upon arrival in Canada: The Government of Canada has put in place an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. The purpose of this Order is to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Compliance with this Order is subject to verification and enforcement. Those in violation may face detention in a quarantine facility as well as fines and/or imprisonment. Upon arrival in Canada, you MUST: Properly wear a well-constructed, well-fitting non-medical mask Undergo a COVID-19 molecular test on the first day you enter Canada and again later during your quarantine period as directed by a quarantine officer (unless you have proof of a previous positive test result 14-90 days before arrival). Check-in at the government-authorized accommodation you pre-booked. Remain there until you receive your on-arrival test result. If the test result is negative, check-out of the government-authorized accommodation and proceed to your suitable place of quarantine. If test result is positive, invalid or indeterminate, await further instructions from a quarantine officer. For more information on mandatory quarantine or isolation requirements for travellers, please visit: For travellers without symptoms of COVID-19 returning to Canada by air For travellers without symptoms of COVID-19 returning to Canada by land For travellers with COVID-19 symptoms returning to Canada by air For travellers with COVID-19 symptoms returning to Canada by land As the continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to COVID-19, there are some exemptions to the order to quarantine for classes of travellers who perform an essential job or function. If you don't have symptoms of COVID-19 and you're a member of one of the classes of persons listed in the mandatory isolation order as exempt from federal quarantine requirements, you are still required to respect the intent of the order in addition to any provincial and local requirements. Some provinces and territories have additional travel restrictions. Some examples of additional travel restrictions may include: prohibiting non-essential travel into the province limited access to certain regions within the province Please refer to the list of provincial and territorial websites for more information.

A Government of Canada representative can give you instructions. While staying at a hotel, you must: stay in your room to avoid contact with others practise physical distancing practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette at all times use a delivery service and ask that the meal be left outside the door of your hotel room If you do not have a suitable place to quarantine Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases, travellers are expected to make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although alternative accommodations (e.g. with family or friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for accommodations, including hotels, RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees. Make your quarantine plans in advance of your arrival to Canada. Foreign nationals who do not have a suitable plan may be denied entry into Canada. If you do not have a suitable place to quarantine, you may be directed to a federal designated quarantine facility where you must remain for your entire mandatory quarantine. Before travellers are directed to a federal designated quarantine facility, government representatives may work with them to confirm that all other options for quarantine accommodations within their own means have been exhausted. These facilities are a last resort for travellers who have no options of meeting quarantine requirements by other means. Where required, transportation from the border crossing to a federal designated quarantine facility is provided by the Government of Canada. Submit your quarantine plan If coming to Canada as a final destination, all travellers must use ArriveCAN to submit their plan. Use ArriveCAN to submit your travel and quarantine plans You will be asked questions about your plans for quarantine upon arrival.

They may be exempt from the mandatory requirements if they meet the relevant criteria and they are entering for the purpose of that function. Travellers who are exempt from quarantine as essential service providers, are workers whose job is included in the Chief Public Health Officer Group Exemption list (see Essential Reasons: quarantine exemption list below).

The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. NEW TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS: The Government of Canada has suspended entry into Canada of all commercial and private passenger flights from India and Pakistan, effective 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021. Passengers who depart India or Pakistan to Canada after 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021, via an indirect route, will need to obtain a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada. Requirements related to COVID-19 testing upon arrival in Canada and a mandatory stay of up to 3 nights at a government-authorized accommodation are in effect for air travellers. Air travellers 5 years of age or older travelling to Canada are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before the aircraft's initial scheduled departure time. Travellers entering Canada at land borders are required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the U.S. within 72 hours of arrival at the border. Air and land travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to departure, instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. Canadians who must travel abroad should consider how they will meet these requirements before departure, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay. Travellers who receive a negative test result and are authorized to enter Canada must still complete the full, mandatory 14-day quarantine. Before you travel: Do not travel if you: have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild are in quarantine or isolation, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 If you are well and must travel: Plan where you will obtain a COVID-19 molecular test in your destination prior to returning to Canada. Pre-book a 3-night stay at a government authorized accommodation prior to your return to Canada. Verify that you can meet your destination country's entry requirements Consult the Travel Advice and Advisories page, and select your destination. Information on entry/exit requirements can be found under the 'Entry/exit requirements' tab. Find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that there is an unforeseen lockdown or local health services become overwhelmed. Check with your travel insurance provider and make sure you are covered for COVID-19-related medical expenses, other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses, as well as trip interruption. Make sure you meet requirements to board a flight in Canada. Plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make. During your travel: Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices: Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting non-medical mask when recommended, such as when: you're in shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs.

Make your quarantine plans in advance of your arrival to Canada. Foreign nationals who do not have a suitable plan may be denied entry into Canada. If you do not have a suitable place to quarantine, you may be directed to a federal designated quarantine facility where you must remain for your entire mandatory quarantine.

They may be exempt from the mandatory requirements if they meet the relevant criteria and they are entering for the purpose of that function. Travellers who are exempt from quarantine as essential service providers, are workers whose job is included in the Chief Public Health Officer Group Exemption list (see Essential Reasons: quarantine exemption list below).

Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the Quarantine Act and could lead to fines.

If you do not have an adequate place to isolate, or do not have private transportation to your place of isolation, you will be directed to a federal designated quarantine facility where you must remain for 14 days. Before travellers are directed to a federal designated quarantine facility government representatives will work to confirm that all other options for isolation accommodations within their own means have been exhausted. These facilities are a last resort for travellers who have no options of meeting isolation requirements by other means. Where required, transportation from the border crossing to a federal designated quarantine facility will be provided by the Government of Canada.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising extra caution if you must travel. Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 are under investigation in many countries, and it is expected that these variants will be reported in more countries as time goes on. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its international partners including the WHO to better understand these variants and their impacts. Understand requirements as you plan travel Canadians who must travel abroad should plan how they'll meet Canada's travel requirements upon their return, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay at their destination. Travellers who are authorized to enter Canada must follow all testing, quarantine and reporting requirements.

With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices. Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice. Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care. Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test. Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting mask when recommended, such as when: you're in a shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household; you're advised by the local public health authority. Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are: as few and as brief as possible from the greatest physical distance possible Avoid closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places when with people from outside of your immediate household. When possible improve indoor air quality in shared spaces through increased ventilation. Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes. Limit contact with people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19, like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel. Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs. If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that you frequently touch. Returning to Canada Do not travel if you: become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, even if mild, prior to your planned return to Canada have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19 have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding.

Measures that require all air passengers to wear a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn mask to cover their mouth, nose, and chin during travel are in effect.

If you must travel, it is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series in Canada before travelling. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 when travelling internationally. Evidence indicates that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. However, fully vaccinated travellers may still be at risk for getting and possibly spreading some COVID-19 variants. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably at least 6 weeks before you travel.

If you must travel, it is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series in Canada before travelling. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 when travelling internationally. Evidence indicates that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. However, fully vaccinated travellers may still be at risk for getting and possibly spreading some COVID-19 variants. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably at least 6 weeks before you travel. All travellers need to pay close attention to the COVID-19 situation at their destination, including at the local level, before travelling. The COVID-19 situation can change rapidly.
