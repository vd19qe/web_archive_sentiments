I have a great relationship with them, and find them to respond quickly to my requests by email or by phone. I have had them create my website and update it on two occasions and every time the experience has been excellent. My most recent update was to make my site mobile friendly. They anticipated my needs and exceeded expectations, requiring very little involvement on my part to achieve my goals allowing me to focus on what I do best. Great work team!

I found Future Access on line and looked at a their library of web designs and felt that they had what I needed, personality and insight. I am not only using Future Access as my web design company but they also designed my book cover and caricature.

At Future Access, we’ve put considerable thought into keeping our employees safe while ensuring our clients are receiving the level of service they’ve come to expect from us.</p> <p>Some of the ways we’ve adapted to COVID-19 include:</p> <ul> <li>Continuing to allow for staff to work remotely;</li> <li>Staff who opt to come in have their workstations sanitized frequently;</li> <li>All high touch surfaces in the office are sanitized often;</li> <li>For Staff and Clients&#8217; safety, all in-person meetings with clients have changed to virtual meetings through Zoho Meeting, Google Meet, Zoom, Go to Meeting or other platforms.</li> </ul> <p>We also look at the current situation as an opportunity to address commonly held beliefs. One of these (long-held) beliefs is offices should be open between Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm. Although this concept is ingrained in Canadian culture, it’s assumed the most effective method for both Staff and Clients. We have to question ourselves and ask:</p> <p><em>“Is working five days a week the best approach in serving our Staff and Clients?”</em></p> <p>With an evidence-based approach and in our constant efforts in creating the best possible work environment for our staff, we’ve decided to conduct a trial 4-day work week for June.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Starting June 1, our staff will work from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 5 pm.</strong></p> <h3>Why Have You Decided to Conduct this Trial?</h3> <p>There are a variety of reasons, including:</p> <p><strong>Better Work-Life Balance</strong></p> <p>Giving employees an extra personal day allows them to work on personal projects and hobbies and spend more time with families. Working long hours contributes to stress, which in turn can have negative health effects on employees. Improved work-life balance helps employees be healthier and ready to work.</p> <p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></p> <p>Employees are more productive when given time to rest and relax adequately. Employees will be less burnt out from long working hours and will be more productive at their jobs.</p> <p><strong>Competitive advantage for hiring</strong></p> <p>A four-day workweek is also a competitive advantage for employees as they value work-life balance and flexible scheduling.</p> <h3>What Are You Basing this Information On?</h3> <p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40"">Microsoft Japan</a> did a great case study for the benefits of a four-day work week in the summer of 2019. Employees there worked four days a week while receiving their regular five-day paycheque. They reported increased efficiency across the business. Decreased electricity usage, fewer meetings held, and fewer pages printed helped contribute. Microsoft reported this all resulted in a 40% productivity boost across the business. Microsoft Japan isn&#8217;t the only business or country that has tried this either. Another well-known example is of a New Zealand trust management company called Perpetual Guardian. After switching to a four-day work week with a normal week&#8217;s salary, they reported a <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-idea-for-the-new-decade-4-day-week-phenomenon-told-in-new-book-300934244.html"">20% gain in employee</a> Perpetual Guardian also saw a 27% reduction in work stress levels and a 45% increase in work-life balance. In examining the results, they decided to make the policy permanent.</p> <h3>What if I Need Support?</h3> <p>On Fridays in June, telephone calls and emails will still be answered by the owners, Tricia and Chris Tollins, for support, just as there is currently support for critical issues on evenings and weekends.</p> <h3>Will My Project Still be Done on Time?</h3> <p>Yes! We’ve been expecting the transition to a 4-day work week and have based our timelines on that assumption.</p> <h3>Is This Permanent?</h3> <p>We’re conducting the 4-day work week as a trial. It&#8217;s a new concept for everyone, so we want to ensure we’re meeting the needs of both staff and clients alike. Should the trial prove to be successful, we will extend it until August 31 and re-evaluate then.</p> <h3>Is the 4-Day Work Week a Cost Saving Measure?</h3> <p>No, staff wages will remain the same. The 4-day work week is to better the health and wellness of our staff while ensuring our clients receive the same quality service.</p> <h3>In Review</h3> <p>The 4-day work week trial begins in June, where staff will continue to work Monday through Thursday, 9 am to 5 pm. Tricia and Chris Tollins will continue to be available for telephone calls and email on Fridays, with emergency support offered on evenings and weekends.</p> <p>We will evaluate this trial in the month of June by ensuring:</p> <ul> <li>Clients’ needs are consistently met;</li> <li>Milestones and deadlines are being achieved on time;</li> <li>There is a net-zero negative impact on business;</li> <li>Employee satisfaction increases; and,</li> <li>There is a significant increase in productivity.</li> </ul> <p>Future Access believes a 4-day workweek is an ethical business decision for our staff that will have no negative impact on projects or clients. We’re excited about this endeavour and hope this trial will become permanent.</p> <p><em>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me at (905) 323-9818.</em></p> <p>Be well,</p> <p>Chris</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-4-day-work-week/"">The 4-Day Work Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/ Future Access Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:24:19 +0000 Uncategorised email gsuite office 365 canadian web hosting https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7500 <p>We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform....</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform. We’re excited about this! Google Cloud offers tremendous value, including fast loading times, scalability for increases in traffic, and some of the best security features of any web hosting platform available.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This change is part of our mission to always find ways to deliver greater value to our customers. There’s just one hitch: with our transition to Google Cloud, we are no longer able to offer email hosting services. Because of this, anyone who hosts their email with us will have to transition to another provider.  </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not to worry, though. In the interest of saving you time, our team has researched and reviewed many of the email hosting options available and has come up with what we think are the three best options based on criteria such as service, speed, security, price, additional offerings and best overall value*. Let’s dive in!</span></p> <h4><b>Google G Suite</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Available as a separate service from its web hosting offering, Google offers a comprehensive email hosting package for businesses. Google’s Gmail for business is safe, secure, offers 24/7 support, and its basic package comes with a range of additional features such as video and voice conferencing, secure team messaging, shared calendars, software for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations, 30GB of cloud storage, and more. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gmail for business is quick to set up and syncs with Microsoft Outlook, so you can migrate old emails. Google also guarantees 99.9% uptime with 0% planned downtime. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Google offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basic – $7.80</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Business – $15.60</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enterprise – $34</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Google’s business email service, </span><a href=""https://gsuite.google.com/products/gmail/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Microsoft Office 365</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft’s Exchange Online program is designed to provide flexibility and a range of options to suit the needs of any business. Whether you need only email hosting or a full suite of professional business products and services, Microsoft’s Exchange Online program has you covered. The basic plan includes 50GB of mailbox storage, the ability to send emails that are up to 150 MB in size, a web-based version of Outlook, the ability to compare calendars to schedule meetings, premium security features, and automatic archiving. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 1) – $5.10</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 2) – $10.20</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Office 365 Business Premium – $16.00</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Microsoft’s Exchange Online program, </span><a href=""https://products.office.com/en-ca/exchange/email""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p> <h4><b>Canadian Web Hosting</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most affordable options we could find is the homegrown company Canadian Web Hosting. For only $3 per user per month, Canadian Web Hosting provides you with custom email addresses, 24/7 support, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, 5 GB mailbox storage, migration support, anti-spam, and anti-virus services, shared calendaring and contacts, Outlook for desktop, mobile and webmail access, and a control panel for your network administrator.

Our quick guide will walk you through the main steps to get this taken care. However, depending on the complexity of your site and how it was developed, <em>there might be a few additional steps which aren&#8217;t covered in this guide</em>. Also, please note that as WordPress is updated, these screenshots and instructions may become outdated.</p> <h3>Setting up an SSL for your Website</h3> <p>With a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) installed on your website, you can enable HTTPS which will then protect sensitive data (such as contact form data) from being intercepted as the data passes through the internet.  It&#8217;s also a contributing factor to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for a website, so it&#8217;s not only good for your customers, but it&#8217;s also good for you! When your site is secure it adds an image of a lock beside your URL:</p> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image-7392 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png"" alt=""HTTPS SSL example"" width=""452"" height=""35"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png 452w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example-300x23.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"" /></p> <p>All websites <a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/website-hosting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hosted and developed by Future Access</a> come equipped with a SSL immediately.</p> <h3>Enabling HTTPS on your WordPress Website</h3> <p>To enable HTTPS on your WordPress website, you need to make sure that all links on your website point to HTTPS and not HTTP. There are a couple of ways you can do this. You can:</p> <ol> <li><a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/contact/"">contact us</a> and we can take care of it for you!</li> <li>install a plugin which can update all HTTP links to HTTPS</li> </ol> <h3>Use a Plugin to update your Website to use HTTPS</h3> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p> <p>On a WordPress website, there is a plugin that we like to use called &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221; (developed by Delicious Brains). To install and use this plugin, start by selecting &#8220;Plugins&#8221; log into WordPress, and select &#8220;Plugins&#8221; and &#8220;Add New&#8221; on the left-hand sidebar.</p> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image-7396 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-Plugins-Add-New.png"" alt=""Plugins Add New"" width=""161"" height=""131"" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p> <p>Search for the plugin in the upper-right search bar for &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221;.</p> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image-7397 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Better-Search-Replace-keyword-search.png"" alt=""better search replace"" width=""949"" height=""50"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Better-Search-Replace-keyword-search.png 949w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Better-Search-Replace-keyword-search-300x16.png 300w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Better-Search-Replace-keyword-search-768x40.png 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px"" /></p> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p> <p>Install the &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221; plugin (and make sure to activate it once installed).</p> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image-7400 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-Better-Search-Replace-Plugin-Install.png"" alt=""better search replace plugin install"" width=""477"" height=""288"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-Better-Search-Replace-Plugin-Install.png 477w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-Better-Search-Replace-Plugin-Install-300x181.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px"" /></p> <p><strong>Step 4: </strong></p> <p>Select &#8220;Tools&#8221; from the left-hand sidebar, and then &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221;.</p> <p><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7401 size-full"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5-Tools-Better-Search-replace.png"" alt=""tools better search replace"" width=""160"" height=""244"" /></p> <p><strong>Step 5: </strong></p> <p>To execute the Search and Replace function (to change all HTTP references to HTTPS), you&#8217;ll want to setup the features similar to the example below, but be sure to use your own domain name.

Take Nike for an example. Nike is a brand which focuses on athleticism and really solidified their voice and identity once their &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; campaign took off.</p> <p>&#8220;Just Do It&#8221; showcases Nike&#8217;s encouraging, yet stern voice. Basically playing the role of a friend or partner wanting to help you (the customer) reach your physical goals.</p> <p>Another example is Google and Apple. Google has more of a problem solver voice, they want to help you in any way possible. Meanwhile, Apple has more of a friendly but confident voice. They want to make life easier for you and are confident in their abilities (and products) to make that happen.</p> <p>We like to describe Future Access&#8217; voice as personable and willing to help. You can get hints of our vibe from just the way we carry ourselves online and in-person!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is a Brand Voice?</h2> <p>Your brand voice is your brand&#8217;s identity. Your brand voice helps customers understand your core values, mission, and standards without having to do a deep dive in to research. A brand voice helps in making your brand appear more &#8220;human,&#8221; therefore making it easier for customers to connect and relate to.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is having a Brand Voice Important?</h2> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7132"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />When people find a brand that they can relate to, they tend to keep coming back. This builds a strong and loyal fan base. If the brand voice is used across all media platforms (on and offline), it doesn&#8217;t just make the brand appear cohesive but it will also train the public.</p> <p>People will eventually know what to expect from your brand and if done right, will then associate your brand with a specific word or feeling. This is a good thing because your brand will always be in mind even if its not being directly advertised.</p> <p>Beyond loyalty and being top of mind, a brand voice is very important to have as it can set you apart from your competitors. Like stated previously, your customers should be able to identify your core values, mission, and standards, making it easy for them to weigh out the pros and cons of your brand vs. a competitor&#8217;s. Here are some example questions your brand voice might want to answer to really draw customers in:</p> <ul> <li>What makes your brand different?</li> <li>How far is your brand willing to go to keep customers happy?</li> <li>Does your brand care for the community? How so?</li> </ul> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7133"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Internally, having an established voice also helps with marketing efforts. Creating content and handling community engagement online is a lot easier when a voice is developed. Captions and responses almost write themselves when you stick to a specific brand voice and identity.</p> <p>Whether you are new to the industry or a well established brand, developing a brand voice is a &#8220;must.&#8221; Now, it won&#8217;t come to you overnight but a good place to start would be to really think of what kind of brand you want to be. Figure out your brand&#8217;s core values, purpose, and goals and then tackle your brand&#8217;s voice and identity.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Need help with cohesive branding and marketing?

Whether you&#8217;re a student forced to write an essay, an author, or in this case, a blog writer &#8211; we&#8217;ve all been through it. And, I&#8217;m sure we can mutually agree that writer&#8217;s block is no fun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of us are able to take our sweet time when it comes to writing. Most times, we are writing to meet a deadline so taking a leisurely break is not always an option when writer&#8217;s block decides to creep in.  After years of writing article after article, I am excited to bring you three ways you can overcome writer&#8217;s fatigue from a blogger&#8217;s standpoint!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ways to Overcome Writer&#8217;s Block</h2> <h3> What&#8217;s Trending in Your Industry?</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7122"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Ask yourself this question if you are stumped on a blog topic. Every industry has something new and exciting going on, so train yourself to keep your eyes and ears peeled for trends and big changes.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not always easy keeping up with industry trends so I would suggest subscribing to reliable news outlets, blogs, or big name companies within your industry.</p> <p>Seek out popular and credible brands and bookmark them on your browser for convenience. These brands in particular have two jobs: to stay ahead of the curve and to inform those in the industry. With reliable references, you can deliver &#8220;trending right now&#8221; content to your readers. In turn, this will make your brand appear relevant and credible in the industry.</p> <h3>Just Write Something &#8211; Literally, Anything!</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7123"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""323"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Sometimes the best blogs come from nothing. People often say that overthinking kills creativity and that&#8217;s where writer&#8217;s block can stem from. The key to getting out of this rut is to just write something &#8211; with no plans or topic in mind.</p> <p>The &#8220;freestyle&#8221; approach is easier said than done but once you get in to the swing of it, the blog will almost write itself. The initial push is sometimes the only thing you need to get in to the routine of writing!</p> <h3>Read Blogs for Inspiration</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7124"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Reading blogs written by other people in your industry can really help cure writer&#8217;s fatigue simply because it will get your brain up and running.</p> <p>I tend to draw a lot of inspiration from other people&#8217;s blogs. In fact, this blog was actually inspired by 0 Ways to Overcome Writer’s Block When Blogging</a>.</p> <p>Reading other people&#8217;s opinion on something I am interested in is always eye opening but that doesn&#8217;t mean I always agree with them. When taking inspiration from blogs written by others, always remember to add your own flare and twist to it. Not only is plagiarism illegal, it is also just plain ole boring and unoriginal.</p> <p>Try reading someone else&#8217;s blog and then, write your own take on it featuring your own thoughts, perspectives, and experiences. If it&#8217;s a write-up that is not opinion-based but instead factual, try to present the topic in a different way. Change up the voice or the order to keep content fresh and original.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I cannot promise that these three techniques will keep writer&#8217;s block from happening again. But, I do hope that these tips will help you handle it better when it does strike back. Happy writing fellow bloggers!</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/overcoming-writers-block-as-a-blog-writer/"">Overcoming Writer&#8217;s Block as a Blog Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/ Jennifer Noun Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:13 +0000 Future Access Team Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7067 <p>When people think of the digital industry, they often think about technology.

Technology has successfully replaced many human jobs in numerous industries, the one thing it cannot replace is the power of creative collaboration. At Future Access, we believe that the digital marketing industry should always have a social element to it.</p> <p>To ensure our marketing strategies are &#8220;human&#8221; and easy to relate to, we have implemented weekly marketing meetings. Marketing meetings are specifically for our digital marketing team. It is a time for our marketing team to sit down and collaborate, problem solve, and connect with each other!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Affects of Marketing Meetings</h2> <h3>Unplugged Discussions</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7094"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Like stated in the opener, when people think of the digital industry, they think of technology. However, with digital marketing, even though it is all on the internet, it is still marketing which means you are still aiming to sell to humans with real emotions and opinions.</p> <p>Having a designated time to &#8220;unplug&#8221; is needed in this industry. Even when brainstorming ideas for the digital space. Because the internet is massive, it is so easy to be influenced by what we see online.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being influenced and just flat out copying an idea. With an unplugged discussion, we are able to create authentic, out-of-the-box (or should we say, &#8220;off-of-the-screen&#8221;) marketing tactics and ideas.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Open Conversation</h3> <p>You&#8217;d think that we&#8217;d be transparent with each other simply because we spend nearly 8 hours a day together but that&#8217;s not the case at all. Since each person on our marketing team manages their own clients, it is super easy for each person to get lost in their own work.</p> <p>Having designated meeting days really help in forcing our team to step away from work and daily distractions and focus in on what&#8217;s on their minds. Weekly marketing meetings give our marketers a set day and time to share their projects, concerns, and goals. Ultimately, improving internal communication and understanding of each person&#8217;s role.</p> <h3>Bigger and Better Ideas</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7097"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Collaboration is the key to success! Digital marketing is an industry which thrives on relevancy and lifestyle. In an agency setting, we are often working with clients in industries we are not extremely knowledgeable in and that&#8217;s part of the fun! With co-workers coming from all walks of life, it is important to &#8216;put our heads together.&#8217;</p> <p>Working together gives you the opportunity to develop unique, never-done-before content. Every person has something to offer and sometimes, it takes a good brainstorming session to bring that out! And, that&#8217;s exactly how big, more effective marketing strategies are made.</p> <p>Weekly meetings have done a whole lot of good for us but these are the three biggest game changers! These highlighted benefits are great because they tap in to two very important parts of business, the internal side of things, along with effective execution (externally and internally). Regardless of what kind of business you run, we highly suggest hosting weekly or monthly meetings for each department. You&#8217;ll be amazed at the positive changes it will bring to the table.</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/"">What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Why Hire an App Development Agency? https://futureaccess.ca/why-hire-an-app-development-agency/ Jennifer Noun Tue, 14 May 2019 18:01:37 +0000 App Development https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7032 <p>As the need for apps continues to grow, so does the competition in the app development industry.

So, this is why we want to help you make the right decision when it comes to picking your perfect app developer or team.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons You Should Hire a Local App Development Agency</h2> <p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg"" alt=""man coding on laptop in an office"" width=""600"" height=""400"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p><strong>1. Dedication</strong></p> <p>It comes with no surprise that when you hire an app developer from a local agency, they are 100% committed and dedicated to working with you. A developer from an agency has guidelines and expectations he or she must reach, usually based on industry standards. This ultimately impacts the overall quality. Another perk that comes with this is peace of mind! You can rest easy knowing that your app is in the hands of an experienced team.</p> <p><strong>2. Organization</strong></p> <p>Most specialized agencies have project managers which help keep the project running smoothly. The project manager usually oversees and communicates what&#8217;s going on, what should happen next, and any concerns that may arise. Not only will the communication be a lot smoother with a project manager involved, you will feel a sense of comfort knowing that your agency of choice is organized, internally. Having a project manager involved also ensures cost effectiveness. He or she is in charge of keeping the project in scope at all times!</p> <p><strong>3. Fixed Pricing</strong></p> <p>Freelancers typically charge hourly &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a bad thing but you might be able to get more bang for your buck working alongside an agency. Agencies typically have fixed prices or bundles available. These bundled deals are created based on an entire scope of a project, from start to finish. This will give you a good idea of budget and how long it takes to develop an app from scratch!</p> <p>With a fixed price, you don&#8217;t have to constantly stress about hours and how much you have to pay each day. Fixed pricing gives you an exact budget and a list of services you can expect to receive during and after the project is complete.</p> <p>Interested in learning more about app development?

It is extremely important to know how to write an email that is easy to understand, kind, and straight to the point. After a few years of replying to thousands and thousands of emails, it is safe to say that we&#8217;ve gained some skills in this particular department &#8211; let&#8217;s dive in!</p> <p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7024"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How to Write Better Emails</h2> <h3>1. Get to the Point</h3> <p>To avoid potential miscommunication, you can never go wrong with getting straight to the point. If you feel like your email comes off a little too straight forward, don&#8217;t be afraid to add a kind transitional sentence like:</p> <p><em>&#8220;Hi there! I&#8217;m sure you are very busy today so I&#8217;ll  just get right to the point&#8230;&#8221;</em></p> <h3>2. One Big Suggestion or Idea Per Email</h3> <p>Including only one &#8220;big idea&#8221; in an email is ideal; it makes it easier for you and the other person to get on the same page quicker, ultimately eliminating potential mishaps. After the initial greeting portion of the email, try to propose your idea with transitions such as:</p> <p><em>&#8220;The ideal solution is&#8230;&#8221;, &#8221; The key takeaway is&#8230;&#8221;,</em> or <em>&#8220;Here is what I&#8217;d suggest&#8230;&#8221;. </em></p> <h3>3. Avoid Open-Ended Questions</h3> <p>Cut to the chase and be confident with the questions you are asking. Although it might be obvious to you, humans are not mind readers, let them know what the next steps are. Example:</p> <p><em>&#8220;I believe launching the new marketing campaign next month would be beneficial. If you agree please reply with &#8220;Yes&#8221;, if not, please reply &#8220;No&#8221; and explain your reasoning. Thank you.&#8221; </em></p> <p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7026"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p>We understand that writing emails might not be everyone&#8217;s strong suit, this is exactly why we chose to touch on this topic.

Instead of an awkward, let&#8217;s-talk-business situation, we opted for a more casual approach to make sure everyone feels comfortable.</p> <p>After hosting a few bi-monthly sessions we realized just how important it is to have these scheduled conversations and discussions. The impact team brainstorming has made on our team and the overall office environment has been very beneficial for us, and this is why we want to share with you the importance of creative team brainstorming as a business.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons to Brainstorm as a Team</h2> <h3>Team Building</h3> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image-6977 alignright"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Team building is a topic we&#8217;ve touched on numerous times in our blogs and on social media. If you&#8217;re a Future Access follower, you would know that we host bi-monthly team Game Days to encourage team building in a fun and interactive way.</p> <p>Game Days have proven to be quite successful in helping our team bond but because we are so occupied by fun activities, it doesn&#8217;t give us a chance to talk a whole lot of business.</p> <p>Team Beer and Brainstorming sessions allows us to team build on a completely different level &#8211; one that is still casual, yet serious and more relevant to our industry and business goals. It gave us the opportunity to share our thoughts and where we hope to see Future Access in the future.</p> <h3>Different Perspectives and Ideas</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6979"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Brainstorming as a team means that there are a collection of different thoughts, opinions, perspectives, and ideas. Although that may seem overwhelming, it can also be very helpful, especially if ideas are becoming stale.</p> <p>Stale ideas tend to stem from a single person generating ideas. And, although that person might have fantastic ideas, its always nice to take a peek at what goes on in other people&#8217;s heads.</p> <p>Making Beer and Brainstorming sessions a regular thing at Future Access has allowed us to see things in a different light. Sometimes, we as human beings get so stuck in our own heads. Opening up this conversations gives team members of different departments an opportunity to share fresh, unbiased ideas.</p> <h3>Improved Critical Thinking</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6983"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />With team brainstorming sessions comes positive and negative honesty &#8211; which is not a bad thing!  Sharing concerns and problems forces us to practice our critical thinking and problem solving skills. This is a skill you want to encourage to further personal and team growth.</p> <p>At Future Access, it is pretty incredible to hear the innovative ideas our team members come up with. When a problem is presented, you can see each one of our team members processing the problem and coming up with an unbiased and logical solution.</p> <p>Now, this skill takes time to develop but with every Beer and Brainstorming session we have, there is a visible difference. Our problem solving skills are quicker and come from a more logical and well-thought out place.</p> <p>In doing these casual meetings, we found out that most of our team members have very similar goals. Now that we are aware of that, we are able to help each other succeed in reaching those achievements. Our work ethic and communication has improved tremendously and our goal for Future Access as a whole has never been clearer. This is why we want to encourage businesses of all kinds to try out monthly or bi-monthly brainstorming sessions! After all, they do say that &#8220;Two heads are better than one.&#8221;</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-importance-of-creative-team-brainstorming/"">The Importance of Creative Team Brainstorming</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You? https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/ Jennifer Noun Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:04:47 +0000 E-commerce Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=6869 <p>Facebook Store is an add-on functionality that Facebook has recently added to their popular social network platform.

The Facebook Store can be added to new or existing Facebook Business Pages, allowing business&#8217; to sell their product directly on Facebook.</p> <p>Although they have not out right said it themselves, it is pretty clear to us that Facebook created Facebook Store with the goal of growing their ever-transforming platform, while providing an easy-to-use and understand selling option for small or big businesses.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Need to Know About Facebook Store (Canada)</h2> <h3>Facebook Store Set Up</h3> <p><strong>Start from Scratch</strong></p> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6906"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/laptop-and-smartphone-with-facebook-displayed-e1549997396421.jpg"" alt=""likes, comments, and friend invites on facebook shown on laptop and smartphone"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />Facebook gives you the option to use their platform as an online shop, kind of like a simplified eCommerce website. This means, business&#8217; now have the ability to sell directly on Facebook.</p> <p>When starting a Facebook Store from scratch, you will have the ability to add, remove, update, or edit inventory manually as you please, as well as the option to communicate payment and delivery details via Facebook Messenger.</p> <p><strong>Connect an eCommerce Platform</strong></p> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6914"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg"" alt=""woman on ecommerce website on her ipad"" width=""450"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg 450w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"" />To make set-up easier for brands that might already have an online shop, Facebook has teamed up with big eCommerce websites such as Shopify.</p> <p>If you already have products on a partnering eCommerce website, Facebook Store gives you the ability to link the two platforms together.</p> <p>This means, you can connect your Shopify products without having to rewrite product descriptions and prices. This feature in particular makes inventory management super easy.</p> <h3>Cost of Running a Facebook Store</h3> <p><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6908"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/couple-sitting-on-floor-taking-product-photos-of-clothing-e1549997702587.jpg"" alt=""couple surrounded by packaging boxes while taking product photos of fashion items"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, you would know that Facebook is a free social platform. Creating a Facebook Business Page is also a free feature that Facebook offers- and yes, that includes the Store tab add-on too!</p> <p>Unlike Etsy or eBay, Facebook Store is free when it comes to listing items. It is safe to say that Facebook Store is a fees free alternative.</p> <p><strong>How can Facebook offer a fees free shop option?</strong> Simply by not offering a built-in payment process and delivery option for Canadian-based Facebook Stores. Finding a payment method and delivery service will be your responsibility and there might be a cost to manage that part of business.</p> <h3>Is Facebook Store the Right Choice for You?</h3> <p><strong>Pros of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>It&#8217;s a cheap alternative to a &#8220;website&#8221;</li> <li>It&#8217;s easy to navigate and users are familiar with the platform already</li> <li>A great alternative for the non-tech savvy shop owners and customers out there</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is a lack of customization options</li> <li>A payment method and delivery option is not included</li> </ul> <p>Now you decide &#8211; is Facebook Store appropriate for your business? Your audience? Your products? Yes the low risk cost is hard to resist but remember, the first impression of a business is very important. It is valuable to do your research and explore your options.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Let&#8217;s work together to build your online store!</a></center></p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/"">What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You?</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>",0.20879457294428247,0.4827498346829742,Positive,Objective

At Future Access, we’ve put considerable thought into keeping our employees safe while ensuring our clients are receiving the level of service they’ve come to expect from us.</p> <p>Some of the ways we’ve adapted to COVID-19 include:</p> <ul> <li>Continuing to allow for staff to work remotely;</li> <li>Staff who opt to come in have their workstations sanitized frequently;</li> <li>All high touch surfaces in the office are sanitized often;</li> <li>For Staff and Clients&#8217; safety, all in-person meetings with clients have changed to virtual meetings through Zoho Meeting, Google Meet, Zoom, Go to Meeting or other platforms.</li> </ul> <p>We also look at the current situation as an opportunity to address commonly held beliefs. One of these (long-held) beliefs is offices should be open between Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm. Although this concept is ingrained in Canadian culture, it’s assumed the most effective method for both Staff and Clients. We have to question ourselves and ask:</p> <p><em>“Is working five days a week the best approach in serving our Staff and Clients?”</em></p> <p>With an evidence-based approach and in our constant efforts in creating the best possible work environment for our staff, we’ve decided to conduct a trial 4-day work week for June.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Starting June 1, our staff will work from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 5 pm.</strong></p> <h3>Why Have You Decided to Conduct this Trial?</h3> <p>There are a variety of reasons, including:</p> <p><strong>Better Work-Life Balance</strong></p> <p>Giving employees an extra personal day allows them to work on personal projects and hobbies and spend more time with families. Working long hours contributes to stress, which in turn can have negative health effects on employees. Improved work-life balance helps employees be healthier and ready to work.</p> <p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></p> <p>Employees are more productive when given time to rest and relax adequately. Employees will be less burnt out from long working hours and will be more productive at their jobs.</p> <p><strong>Competitive advantage for hiring</strong></p> <p>A four-day workweek is also a competitive advantage for employees as they value work-life balance and flexible scheduling.</p> <h3>What Are You Basing this Information On?</h3> <p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40"">Microsoft Japan</a> did a great case study for the benefits of a four-day work week in the summer of 2019. Employees there worked four days a week while receiving their regular five-day paycheque. They reported increased efficiency across the business. Decreased electricity usage, fewer meetings held, and fewer pages printed helped contribute. Microsoft reported this all resulted in a 40% productivity boost across the business. Microsoft Japan isn&#8217;t the only business or country that has tried this either. Another well-known example is of a New Zealand trust management company called Perpetual Guardian. After switching to a four-day work week with a normal week&#8217;s salary, they reported a <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-idea-for-the-new-decade-4-day-week-phenomenon-told-in-new-book-300934244.html"">20% gain in employee</a> Perpetual Guardian also saw a 27% reduction in work stress levels and a 45% increase in work-life balance. In examining the results, they decided to make the policy permanent.</p> <h3>What if I Need Support?</h3> <p>On Fridays in June, telephone calls and emails will still be answered by the owners, Tricia and Chris Tollins, for support, just as there is currently support for critical issues on evenings and weekends.</p> <h3>Will My Project Still be Done on Time?</h3> <p>Yes! We’ve been expecting the transition to a 4-day work week and have based our timelines on that assumption.</p> <h3>Is This Permanent?</h3> <p>We’re conducting the 4-day work week as a trial. It&#8217;s a new concept for everyone, so we want to ensure we’re meeting the needs of both staff and clients alike. Should the trial prove to be successful, we will extend it until August 31 and re-evaluate then.</p> <h3>Is the 4-Day Work Week a Cost Saving Measure?</h3> <p>No, staff wages will remain the same. The 4-day work week is to better the health and wellness of our staff while ensuring our clients receive the same quality service.</p> <h3>In Review</h3> <p>The 4-day work week trial begins in June, where staff will continue to work Monday through Thursday, 9 am to 5 pm. Tricia and Chris Tollins will continue to be available for telephone calls and email on Fridays, with emergency support offered on evenings and weekends.</p> <p>We will evaluate this trial in the month of June by ensuring:</p> <ul> <li>Clients’ needs are consistently met;</li> <li>Milestones and deadlines are being achieved on time;</li> <li>There is a net-zero negative impact on business;</li> <li>Employee satisfaction increases; and,</li> <li>There is a significant increase in productivity.</li> </ul> <p>Future Access believes a 4-day workweek is an ethical business decision for our staff that will have no negative impact on projects or clients. We’re excited about this endeavour and hope this trial will become permanent.</p> <p><em>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me at (905) 323-9818.</em></p> <p>Be well,</p> <p>Chris</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-4-day-work-week/"">The 4-Day Work Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/ Future Access Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:24:19 +0000 Uncategorised email gsuite office 365 canadian web hosting https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7500 <p>We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform....</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform. We’re excited about this! Google Cloud offers tremendous value, including fast loading times, scalability for increases in traffic, and some of the best security features of any web hosting platform available.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This change is part of our mission to always find ways to deliver greater value to our customers. There’s just one hitch: with our transition to Google Cloud, we are no longer able to offer email hosting services. Because of this, anyone who hosts their email with us will have to transition to another provider.  </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not to worry, though. In the interest of saving you time, our team has researched and reviewed many of the email hosting options available and has come up with what we think are the three best options based on criteria such as service, speed, security, price, additional offerings and best overall value*. Let’s dive in!</span></p> <h4><b>Google G Suite</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Available as a separate service from its web hosting offering, Google offers a comprehensive email hosting package for businesses. Google’s Gmail for business is safe, secure, offers 24/7 support, and its basic package comes with a range of additional features such as video and voice conferencing, secure team messaging, shared calendars, software for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations, 30GB of cloud storage, and more. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gmail for business is quick to set up and syncs with Microsoft Outlook, so you can migrate old emails. Google also guarantees 99.9% uptime with 0% planned downtime. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Google offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basic – $7.80</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Business – $15.60</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enterprise – $34</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Google’s business email service, </span><a href=""https://gsuite.google.com/products/gmail/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Microsoft Office 365</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft’s Exchange Online program is designed to provide flexibility and a range of options to suit the needs of any business. Whether you need only email hosting or a full suite of professional business products and services, Microsoft’s Exchange Online program has you covered. The basic plan includes 50GB of mailbox storage, the ability to send emails that are up to 150 MB in size, a web-based version of Outlook, the ability to compare calendars to schedule meetings, premium security features, and automatic archiving. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 1) – $5.10</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 2) – $10.20</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Office 365 Business Premium – $16.00</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Microsoft’s Exchange Online program, </span><a href=""https://products.office.com/en-ca/exchange/email""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p> <h4><b>Canadian Web Hosting</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most affordable options we could find is the homegrown company Canadian Web Hosting. For only $3 per user per month, Canadian Web Hosting provides you with custom email addresses, 24/7 support, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, 5 GB mailbox storage, migration support, anti-spam, and anti-virus services, shared calendaring and contacts, Outlook for desktop, mobile and webmail access, and a control panel for your network administrator. Canadian Web Hosting even provides discounts for clients with 50 or more users and offers a variety of additional web hosting services. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Canadian Web Hosting’s service, </span><a href=""https://www.canadianwebhosting.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Future Access is Here for You</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have questions or comments about our move to Google Cloud or any other aspect of our services, please contact us at 905-323-9818 or </span><a href=""mailto:info@futureaccess.ca""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">info@futureaccess.ca</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">*Email hosting prices, products and services are accurate as of the date of publication.</span></em></p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Updating WordPress to use HTTPS https://futureaccess.ca/updating-wordpress-to-use-https/ Future Access Thu, 17 Oct 2019 14:32:38 +0000 Uncategorised Web Design Tips Website https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7391 <p>Need a hand setting up your WordPress website to use HTTPS?

When your site is secure it adds an image of a lock beside your URL:</p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-7392 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png"" alt=""HTTPS SSL example"" width=""452"" height=""35"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png 452w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example-300x23.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"" /></p> <p>All websites <a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/website-hosting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hosted and developed by Future Access</a> come equipped with a SSL immediately.</p> <h3>Enabling HTTPS on your WordPress Website</h3> <p>To enable HTTPS on your WordPress website, you need to make sure that all links on your website point to HTTPS and not HTTP.

Take Nike for an example. Nike is a brand which focuses on athleticism and really solidified their voice and identity once their &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; campaign took off.</p> <p>&#8220;Just Do It&#8221; showcases Nike&#8217;s encouraging, yet stern voice. Basically playing the role of a friend or partner wanting to help you (the customer) reach your physical goals.</p> <p>Another example is Google and Apple. Google has more of a problem solver voice, they want to help you in any way possible. Meanwhile, Apple has more of a friendly but confident voice. They want to make life easier for you and are confident in their abilities (and products) to make that happen.</p> <p>We like to describe Future Access&#8217; voice as personable and willing to help. You can get hints of our vibe from just the way we carry ourselves online and in-person!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is a Brand Voice?</h2> <p>Your brand voice is your brand&#8217;s identity. Your brand voice helps customers understand your core values, mission, and standards without having to do a deep dive in to research. A brand voice helps in making your brand appear more &#8220;human,&#8221; therefore making it easier for customers to connect and relate to.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is having a Brand Voice Important?</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7132"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />When people find a brand that they can relate to, they tend to keep coming back. This builds a strong and loyal fan base. If the brand voice is used across all media platforms (on and offline), it doesn&#8217;t just make the brand appear cohesive but it will also train the public.</p> <p>People will eventually know what to expect from your brand and if done right, will then associate your brand with a specific word or feeling. This is a good thing because your brand will always be in mind even if its not being directly advertised.</p> <p>Beyond loyalty and being top of mind, a brand voice is very important to have as it can set you apart from your competitors. Like stated previously, your customers should be able to identify your core values, mission, and standards, making it easy for them to weigh out the pros and cons of your brand vs. a competitor&#8217;s. Here are some example questions your brand voice might want to answer to really draw customers in:</p> <ul> <li>What makes your brand different?</li> <li>How far is your brand willing to go to keep customers happy?</li> <li>Does your brand care for the community? How so?</li> </ul> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7133"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Internally, having an established voice also helps with marketing efforts. Creating content and handling community engagement online is a lot easier when a voice is developed. Captions and responses almost write themselves when you stick to a specific brand voice and identity.</p> <p>Whether you are new to the industry or a well established brand, developing a brand voice is a &#8220;must.&#8221; Now, it won&#8217;t come to you overnight but a good place to start would be to really think of what kind of brand you want to be. Figure out your brand&#8217;s core values, purpose, and goals and then tackle your brand&#8217;s voice and identity.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Need help with cohesive branding and marketing?

Whether you&#8217;re a student forced to write an essay, an author, or in this case, a blog writer &#8211; we&#8217;ve all been through it. And, I&#8217;m sure we can mutually agree that writer&#8217;s block is no fun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of us are able to take our sweet time when it comes to writing. Most times, we are writing to meet a deadline so taking a leisurely break is not always an option when writer&#8217;s block decides to creep in.  After years of writing article after article, I am excited to bring you three ways you can overcome writer&#8217;s fatigue from a blogger&#8217;s standpoint!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ways to Overcome Writer&#8217;s Block</h2> <h3> What&#8217;s Trending in Your Industry?</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7122"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Ask yourself this question if you are stumped on a blog topic. Every industry has something new and exciting going on, so train yourself to keep your eyes and ears peeled for trends and big changes.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not always easy keeping up with industry trends so I would suggest subscribing to reliable news outlets, blogs, or big name companies within your industry.</p> <p>Seek out popular and credible brands and bookmark them on your browser for convenience. These brands in particular have two jobs: to stay ahead of the curve and to inform those in the industry. With reliable references, you can deliver &#8220;trending right now&#8221; content to your readers. In turn, this will make your brand appear relevant and credible in the industry.</p> <h3>Just Write Something &#8211; Literally, Anything!</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7123"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""323"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Sometimes the best blogs come from nothing. People often say that overthinking kills creativity and that&#8217;s where writer&#8217;s block can stem from. The key to getting out of this rut is to just write something &#8211; with no plans or topic in mind.</p> <p>The &#8220;freestyle&#8221; approach is easier said than done but once you get in to the swing of it, the blog will almost write itself. The initial push is sometimes the only thing you need to get in to the routine of writing!</p> <h3>Read Blogs for Inspiration</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7124"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Reading blogs written by other people in your industry can really help cure writer&#8217;s fatigue simply because it will get your brain up and running.</p> <p>I tend to draw a lot of inspiration from other people&#8217;s blogs. In fact, this blog was actually inspired by 0 Ways to Overcome Writer’s Block When Blogging</a>.</p> <p>Reading other people&#8217;s opinion on something I am interested in is always eye opening but that doesn&#8217;t mean I always agree with them. When taking inspiration from blogs written by others, always remember to add your own flare and twist to it. Not only is plagiarism illegal, it is also just plain ole boring and unoriginal.</p> <p>Try reading someone else&#8217;s blog and then, write your own take on it featuring your own thoughts, perspectives, and experiences. If it&#8217;s a write-up that is not opinion-based but instead factual, try to present the topic in a different way. Change up the voice or the order to keep content fresh and original.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I cannot promise that these three techniques will keep writer&#8217;s block from happening again. But, I do hope that these tips will help you handle it better when it does strike back. Happy writing fellow bloggers!</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/overcoming-writers-block-as-a-blog-writer/"">Overcoming Writer&#8217;s Block as a Blog Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/ Jennifer Noun Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:13 +0000 Future Access Team Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7067 <p>When people think of the digital industry, they often think about technology.

Technology has successfully replaced many human jobs in numerous industries, the one thing it cannot replace is the power of creative collaboration. At Future Access, we believe that the digital marketing industry should always have a social element to it.</p> <p>To ensure our marketing strategies are &#8220;human&#8221; and easy to relate to, we have implemented weekly marketing meetings. Marketing meetings are specifically for our digital marketing team. It is a time for our marketing team to sit down and collaborate, problem solve, and connect with each other!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Affects of Marketing Meetings</h2> <h3>Unplugged Discussions</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7094"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Like stated in the opener, when people think of the digital industry, they think of technology. However, with digital marketing, even though it is all on the internet, it is still marketing which means you are still aiming to sell to humans with real emotions and opinions.</p> <p>Having a designated time to &#8220;unplug&#8221; is needed in this industry. Even when brainstorming ideas for the digital space. Because the internet is massive, it is so easy to be influenced by what we see online.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being influenced and just flat out copying an idea. With an unplugged discussion, we are able to create authentic, out-of-the-box (or should we say, &#8220;off-of-the-screen&#8221;) marketing tactics and ideas.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Open Conversation</h3> <p>You&#8217;d think that we&#8217;d be transparent with each other simply because we spend nearly 8 hours a day together but that&#8217;s not the case at all. Since each person on our marketing team manages their own clients, it is super easy for each person to get lost in their own work.</p> <p>Having designated meeting days really help in forcing our team to step away from work and daily distractions and focus in on what&#8217;s on their minds. Weekly marketing meetings give our marketers a set day and time to share their projects, concerns, and goals. Ultimately, improving internal communication and understanding of each person&#8217;s role.</p> <h3>Bigger and Better Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7097"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Collaboration is the key to success! Digital marketing is an industry which thrives on relevancy and lifestyle. In an agency setting, we are often working with clients in industries we are not extremely knowledgeable in and that&#8217;s part of the fun! With co-workers coming from all walks of life, it is important to &#8216;put our heads together.&#8217;</p> <p>Working together gives you the opportunity to develop unique, never-done-before content. Every person has something to offer and sometimes, it takes a good brainstorming session to bring that out! And, that&#8217;s exactly how big, more effective marketing strategies are made.</p> <p>Weekly meetings have done a whole lot of good for us but these are the three biggest game changers! These highlighted benefits are great because they tap in to two very important parts of business, the internal side of things, along with effective execution (externally and internally). Regardless of what kind of business you run, we highly suggest hosting weekly or monthly meetings for each department. You&#8217;ll be amazed at the positive changes it will bring to the table.</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/"">What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Why Hire an App Development Agency? https://futureaccess.ca/why-hire-an-app-development-agency/ Jennifer Noun Tue, 14 May 2019 18:01:37 +0000 App Development https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7032 <p>As the need for apps continues to grow, so does the competition in the app development industry.

So, this is why we want to help you make the right decision when it comes to picking your perfect app developer or team.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons You Should Hire a Local App Development Agency</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg"" alt=""man coding on laptop in an office"" width=""600"" height=""400"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p><strong>1. Dedication</strong></p> <p>It comes with no surprise that when you hire an app developer from a local agency, they are 100% committed and dedicated to working with you. A developer from an agency has guidelines and expectations he or she must reach, usually based on industry standards. This ultimately impacts the overall quality. Another perk that comes with this is peace of mind! You can rest easy knowing that your app is in the hands of an experienced team.</p> <p><strong>2. Organization</strong></p> <p>Most specialized agencies have project managers which help keep the project running smoothly. The project manager usually oversees and communicates what&#8217;s going on, what should happen next, and any concerns that may arise. Not only will the communication be a lot smoother with a project manager involved, you will feel a sense of comfort knowing that your agency of choice is organized, internally. Having a project manager involved also ensures cost effectiveness. He or she is in charge of keeping the project in scope at all times!</p> <p><strong>3. Fixed Pricing</strong></p> <p>Freelancers typically charge hourly &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a bad thing but you might be able to get more bang for your buck working alongside an agency. Agencies typically have fixed prices or bundles available. These bundled deals are created based on an entire scope of a project, from start to finish. This will give you a good idea of budget and how long it takes to develop an app from scratch!</p> <p>With a fixed price, you don&#8217;t have to constantly stress about hours and how much you have to pay each day.

It is extremely important to know how to write an email that is easy to understand, kind, and straight to the point. After a few years of replying to thousands and thousands of emails, it is safe to say that we&#8217;ve gained some skills in this particular department &#8211; let&#8217;s dive in!</p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7024"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How to Write Better Emails</h2> <h3>1. Get to the Point</h3> <p>To avoid potential miscommunication, you can never go wrong with getting straight to the point. If you feel like your email comes off a little too straight forward, don&#8217;t be afraid to add a kind transitional sentence like:</p> <p><em>&#8220;Hi there! I&#8217;m sure you are very busy today so I&#8217;ll  just get right to the point&#8230;&#8221;</em></p> <h3>2. One Big Suggestion or Idea Per Email</h3> <p>Including only one &#8220;big idea&#8221; in an email is ideal; it makes it easier for you and the other person to get on the same page quicker, ultimately eliminating potential mishaps. After the initial greeting portion of the email, try to propose your idea with transitions such as:</p> <p><em>&#8220;The ideal solution is&#8230;&#8221;, &#8221; The key takeaway is&#8230;&#8221;,</em> or <em>&#8220;Here is what I&#8217;d suggest&#8230;&#8221;. </em></p> <h3>3. Avoid Open-Ended Questions</h3> <p>Cut to the chase and be confident with the questions you are asking. Although it might be obvious to you, humans are not mind readers, let them know what the next steps are. Example:</p> <p><em>&#8220;I believe launching the new marketing campaign next month would be beneficial. If you agree please reply with &#8220;Yes&#8221;, if not, please reply &#8220;No&#8221; and explain your reasoning. Thank you.&#8221; </em></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7026"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p>We understand that writing emails might not be everyone&#8217;s strong suit, this is exactly why we chose to touch on this topic.

Instead of an awkward, let&#8217;s-talk-business situation, we opted for a more casual approach to make sure everyone feels comfortable.</p> <p>After hosting a few bi-monthly sessions we realized just how important it is to have these scheduled conversations and discussions. The impact team brainstorming has made on our team and the overall office environment has been very beneficial for us, and this is why we want to share with you the importance of creative team brainstorming as a business.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons to Brainstorm as a Team</h2> <h3>Team Building</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-6977 alignright"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Team building is a topic we&#8217;ve touched on numerous times in our blogs and on social media. If you&#8217;re a Future Access follower, you would know that we host bi-monthly team Game Days to encourage team building in a fun and interactive way.</p> <p>Game Days have proven to be quite successful in helping our team bond but because we are so occupied by fun activities, it doesn&#8217;t give us a chance to talk a whole lot of business.</p> <p>Team Beer and Brainstorming sessions allows us to team build on a completely different level &#8211; one that is still casual, yet serious and more relevant to our industry and business goals. It gave us the opportunity to share our thoughts and where we hope to see Future Access in the future.</p> <h3>Different Perspectives and Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6979"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Brainstorming as a team means that there are a collection of different thoughts, opinions, perspectives, and ideas. Although that may seem overwhelming, it can also be very helpful, especially if ideas are becoming stale.</p> <p>Stale ideas tend to stem from a single person generating ideas. And, although that person might have fantastic ideas, its always nice to take a peek at what goes on in other people&#8217;s heads.</p> <p>Making Beer and Brainstorming sessions a regular thing at Future Access has allowed us to see things in a different light. Sometimes, we as human beings get so stuck in our own heads. Opening up this conversations gives team members of different departments an opportunity to share fresh, unbiased ideas.</p> <h3>Improved Critical Thinking</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6983"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />With team brainstorming sessions comes positive and negative honesty &#8211; which is not a bad thing!  Sharing concerns and problems forces us to practice our critical thinking and problem solving skills. This is a skill you want to encourage to further personal and team growth.</p> <p>At Future Access, it is pretty incredible to hear the innovative ideas our team members come up with. When a problem is presented, you can see each one of our team members processing the problem and coming up with an unbiased and logical solution.</p> <p>Now, this skill takes time to develop but with every Beer and Brainstorming session we have, there is a visible difference. Our problem solving skills are quicker and come from a more logical and well-thought out place.</p> <p>In doing these casual meetings, we found out that most of our team members have very similar goals. Now that we are aware of that, we are able to help each other succeed in reaching those achievements. Our work ethic and communication has improved tremendously and our goal for Future Access as a whole has never been clearer. This is why we want to encourage businesses of all kinds to try out monthly or bi-monthly brainstorming sessions! After all, they do say that &#8220;Two heads are better than one.&#8221;</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-importance-of-creative-team-brainstorming/"">The Importance of Creative Team Brainstorming</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You? https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/ Jennifer Noun Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:04:47 +0000 E-commerce Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=6869 <p>Facebook Store is an add-on functionality that Facebook has recently added to their popular social network platform.

The Facebook Store can be added to new or existing Facebook Business Pages, allowing business&#8217; to sell their product directly on Facebook.</p> <p>Although they have not out right said it themselves, it is pretty clear to us that Facebook created Facebook Store with the goal of growing their ever-transforming platform, while providing an easy-to-use and understand selling option for small or big businesses.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Need to Know About Facebook Store (Canada)</h2> <h3>Facebook Store Set Up</h3> <p><strong>Start from Scratch</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6906"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/laptop-and-smartphone-with-facebook-displayed-e1549997396421.jpg"" alt=""likes, comments, and friend invites on facebook shown on laptop and smartphone"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />Facebook gives you the option to use their platform as an online shop, kind of like a simplified eCommerce website. This means, business&#8217; now have the ability to sell directly on Facebook.</p> <p>When starting a Facebook Store from scratch, you will have the ability to add, remove, update, or edit inventory manually as you please, as well as the option to communicate payment and delivery details via Facebook Messenger.</p> <p><strong>Connect an eCommerce Platform</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6914"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg"" alt=""woman on ecommerce website on her ipad"" width=""450"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg 450w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"" />To make set-up easier for brands that might already have an online shop, Facebook has teamed up with big eCommerce websites such as Shopify.</p> <p>If you already have products on a partnering eCommerce website, Facebook Store gives you the ability to link the two platforms together.</p> <p>This means, you can connect your Shopify products without having to rewrite product descriptions and prices. This feature in particular makes inventory management super easy.</p> <h3>Cost of Running a Facebook Store</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6908"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/couple-sitting-on-floor-taking-product-photos-of-clothing-e1549997702587.jpg"" alt=""couple surrounded by packaging boxes while taking product photos of fashion items"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, you would know that Facebook is a free social platform. Creating a Facebook Business Page is also a free feature that Facebook offers- and yes, that includes the Store tab add-on too!</p> <p>Unlike Etsy or eBay, Facebook Store is free when it comes to listing items. It is safe to say that Facebook Store is a fees free alternative.</p> <p><strong>How can Facebook offer a fees free shop option?</strong> Simply by not offering a built-in payment process and delivery option for Canadian-based Facebook Stores. Finding a payment method and delivery service will be your responsibility and there might be a cost to manage that part of business.</p> <h3>Is Facebook Store the Right Choice for You?</h3> <p><strong>Pros of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>It&#8217;s a cheap alternative to a &#8220;website&#8221;</li> <li>It&#8217;s easy to navigate and users are familiar with the platform already</li> <li>A great alternative for the non-tech savvy shop owners and customers out there</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is a lack of customization options</li> <li>A payment method and delivery option is not included</li> </ul> <p>Now you decide &#8211; is Facebook Store appropriate for your business? Your audience? Your products? Yes the low risk cost is hard to resist but remember, the first impression of a business is very important.

At Future Access, we’ve put considerable thought into keeping our employees safe while ensuring our clients are receiving the level of service they’ve come to expect from us.</p> <p>Some of the ways we’ve adapted to COVID-19 include:</p> <ul> <li>Continuing to allow for staff to work remotely;</li> <li>Staff who opt to come in have their workstations sanitized frequently;</li> <li>All high touch surfaces in the office are sanitized often;</li> <li>For Staff and Clients&#8217; safety, all in-person meetings with clients have changed to virtual meetings through Zoho Meeting, Google Meet, Zoom, Go to Meeting or other platforms.</li> </ul> <p>We also look at the current situation as an opportunity to address commonly held beliefs. One of these (long-held) beliefs is offices should be open between Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm. Although this concept is ingrained in Canadian culture, it’s assumed the most effective method for both Staff and Clients. We have to question ourselves and ask:</p> <p><em>“Is working five days a week the best approach in serving our Staff and Clients?”</em></p> <p>With an evidence-based approach and in our constant efforts in creating the best possible work environment for our staff, we’ve decided to conduct a trial 4-day work week for June.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Starting June 1, our staff will work from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 5 pm.</strong></p> <h3>Why Have You Decided to Conduct this Trial?</h3> <p>There are a variety of reasons, including:</p> <p><strong>Better Work-Life Balance</strong></p> <p>Giving employees an extra personal day allows them to work on personal projects and hobbies and spend more time with families. Working long hours contributes to stress, which in turn can have negative health effects on employees. Improved work-life balance helps employees be healthier and ready to work.</p> <p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></p> <p>Employees are more productive when given time to rest and relax adequately. Employees will be less burnt out from long working hours and will be more productive at their jobs.</p> <p><strong>Competitive advantage for hiring</strong></p> <p>A four-day workweek is also a competitive advantage for employees as they value work-life balance and flexible scheduling.</p> <h3>What Are You Basing this Information On?</h3> <p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40"">Microsoft Japan</a> did a great case study for the benefits of a four-day work week in the summer of 2019. Employees there worked four days a week while receiving their regular five-day paycheque. They reported increased efficiency across the business. Decreased electricity usage, fewer meetings held, and fewer pages printed helped contribute. Microsoft reported this all resulted in a 40% productivity boost across the business. Microsoft Japan isn&#8217;t the only business or country that has tried this either. Another well-known example is of a New Zealand trust management company called Perpetual Guardian. After switching to a four-day work week with a normal week&#8217;s salary, they reported a <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-idea-for-the-new-decade-4-day-week-phenomenon-told-in-new-book-300934244.html"">20% gain in employee</a> Perpetual Guardian also saw a 27% reduction in work stress levels and a 45% increase in work-life balance. In examining the results, they decided to make the policy permanent.</p> <h3>What if I Need Support?</h3> <p>On Fridays in June, telephone calls and emails will still be answered by the owners, Tricia and Chris Tollins, for support, just as there is currently support for critical issues on evenings and weekends.</p> <h3>Will My Project Still be Done on Time?</h3> <p>Yes! We’ve been expecting the transition to a 4-day work week and have based our timelines on that assumption.</p> <h3>Is This Permanent?</h3> <p>We’re conducting the 4-day work week as a trial. It&#8217;s a new concept for everyone, so we want to ensure we’re meeting the needs of both staff and clients alike. Should the trial prove to be successful, we will extend it until August 31 and re-evaluate then.</p> <h3>Is the 4-Day Work Week a Cost Saving Measure?</h3> <p>No, staff wages will remain the same. The 4-day work week is to better the health and wellness of our staff while ensuring our clients receive the same quality service.</p> <h3>In Review</h3> <p>The 4-day work week trial begins in June, where staff will continue to work Monday through Thursday, 9 am to 5 pm. Tricia and Chris Tollins will continue to be available for telephone calls and email on Fridays, with emergency support offered on evenings and weekends.</p> <p>We will evaluate this trial in the month of June by ensuring:</p> <ul> <li>Clients’ needs are consistently met;</li> <li>Milestones and deadlines are being achieved on time;</li> <li>There is a net-zero negative impact on business;</li> <li>Employee satisfaction increases; and,</li> <li>There is a significant increase in productivity.</li> </ul> <p>Future Access believes a 4-day workweek is an ethical business decision for our staff that will have no negative impact on projects or clients. We’re excited about this endeavour and hope this trial will become permanent.</p> <p><em>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me at (905) 323-9818.</em></p> <p>Be well,</p> <p>Chris</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-4-day-work-week/"">The 4-Day Work Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/ Future Access Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:24:19 +0000 Uncategorised email gsuite office 365 canadian web hosting https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7500 <p>We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform....</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We recently announced that by January 1, 2021, we will migrate all client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform. We’re excited about this! Google Cloud offers tremendous value, including fast loading times, scalability for increases in traffic, and some of the best security features of any web hosting platform available.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This change is part of our mission to always find ways to deliver greater value to our customers. There’s just one hitch: with our transition to Google Cloud, we are no longer able to offer email hosting services. Because of this, anyone who hosts their email with us will have to transition to another provider.  </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not to worry, though. In the interest of saving you time, our team has researched and reviewed many of the email hosting options available and has come up with what we think are the three best options based on criteria such as service, speed, security, price, additional offerings and best overall value*. Let’s dive in!</span></p> <h4><b>Google G Suite</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Available as a separate service from its web hosting offering, Google offers a comprehensive email hosting package for businesses. Google’s Gmail for business is safe, secure, offers 24/7 support, and its basic package comes with a range of additional features such as video and voice conferencing, secure team messaging, shared calendars, software for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations, 30GB of cloud storage, and more. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gmail for business is quick to set up and syncs with Microsoft Outlook, so you can migrate old emails. Google also guarantees 99.9% uptime with 0% planned downtime. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Google offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basic – $7.80</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Business – $15.60</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enterprise – $34</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Google’s business email service, </span><a href=""https://gsuite.google.com/products/gmail/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Microsoft Office 365</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft’s Exchange Online program is designed to provide flexibility and a range of options to suit the needs of any business. Whether you need only email hosting or a full suite of professional business products and services, Microsoft’s Exchange Online program has you covered. The basic plan includes 50GB of mailbox storage, the ability to send emails that are up to 150 MB in size, a web-based version of Outlook, the ability to compare calendars to schedule meetings, premium security features, and automatic archiving. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 1) – $5.10</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 2) – $10.20</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Office 365 Business Premium – $16.00</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Microsoft’s Exchange Online program, </span><a href=""https://products.office.com/en-ca/exchange/email""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p> <h4><b>Canadian Web Hosting</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most affordable options we could find is the homegrown company Canadian Web Hosting. For only $3 per user per month, Canadian Web Hosting provides you with custom email addresses, 24/7 support, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, 5 GB mailbox storage, migration support, anti-spam, and anti-virus services, shared calendaring and contacts, Outlook for desktop, mobile and webmail access, and a control panel for your network administrator. Canadian Web Hosting even provides discounts for clients with 50 or more users and offers a variety of additional web hosting services. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Canadian Web Hosting’s service, </span><a href=""https://www.canadianwebhosting.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Future Access is Here for You</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have questions or comments about our move to Google Cloud or any other aspect of our services, please contact us at 905-323-9818 or </span><a href=""mailto:info@futureaccess.ca""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">info@futureaccess.ca</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">*Email hosting prices, products and services are accurate as of the date of publication.</span></em></p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Updating WordPress to use HTTPS https://futureaccess.ca/updating-wordpress-to-use-https/ Future Access Thu, 17 Oct 2019 14:32:38 +0000 Uncategorised Web Design Tips Website https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7391 <p>Need a hand setting up your WordPress website to use HTTPS?

Our quick guide will walk you through the main steps to get this taken care. However, depending on the complexity of your site and how it was developed, <em>there might be a few additional steps which aren&#8217;t covered in this guide</em>. Also, please note that as WordPress is updated, these screenshots and instructions may become outdated.</p> <h3>Setting up an SSL for your Website</h3> <p>With a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) installed on your website, you can enable HTTPS which will then protect sensitive data (such as contact form data) from being intercepted as the data passes through the internet.  It&#8217;s also a contributing factor to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for a website, so it&#8217;s not only good for your customers, but it&#8217;s also good for you! When your site is secure it adds an image of a lock beside your URL:</p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-7392 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png"" alt=""HTTPS SSL example"" width=""452"" height=""35"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png 452w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example-300x23.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"" /></p> <p>All websites <a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/website-hosting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hosted and developed by Future Access</a> come equipped with a SSL immediately.</p> <h3>Enabling HTTPS on your WordPress Website</h3> <p>To enable HTTPS on your WordPress website, you need to make sure that all links on your website point to HTTPS and not HTTP. There are a couple of ways you can do this. You can:</p> <ol> <li><a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/contact/"">contact us</a> and we can take care of it for you!</li> <li>install a plugin which can update all HTTP links to HTTPS</li> </ol> <h3>Use a Plugin to update your Website to use HTTPS</h3> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p> <p>On a WordPress website, there is a plugin that we like to use called &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221; (developed by Delicious Brains).

Take Nike for an example. Nike is a brand which focuses on athleticism and really solidified their voice and identity once their &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; campaign took off.</p> <p>&#8220;Just Do It&#8221; showcases Nike&#8217;s encouraging, yet stern voice. Basically playing the role of a friend or partner wanting to help you (the customer) reach your physical goals.</p> <p>Another example is Google and Apple. Google has more of a problem solver voice, they want to help you in any way possible. Meanwhile, Apple has more of a friendly but confident voice. They want to make life easier for you and are confident in their abilities (and products) to make that happen.</p> <p>We like to describe Future Access&#8217; voice as personable and willing to help. You can get hints of our vibe from just the way we carry ourselves online and in-person!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is a Brand Voice?</h2> <p>Your brand voice is your brand&#8217;s identity. Your brand voice helps customers understand your core values, mission, and standards without having to do a deep dive in to research. A brand voice helps in making your brand appear more &#8220;human,&#8221; therefore making it easier for customers to connect and relate to.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is having a Brand Voice Important?</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7132"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />When people find a brand that they can relate to, they tend to keep coming back. This builds a strong and loyal fan base. If the brand voice is used across all media platforms (on and offline), it doesn&#8217;t just make the brand appear cohesive but it will also train the public.</p> <p>People will eventually know what to expect from your brand and if done right, will then associate your brand with a specific word or feeling. This is a good thing because your brand will always be in mind even if its not being directly advertised.</p> <p>Beyond loyalty and being top of mind, a brand voice is very important to have as it can set you apart from your competitors. Like stated previously, your customers should be able to identify your core values, mission, and standards, making it easy for them to weigh out the pros and cons of your brand vs. a competitor&#8217;s. Here are some example questions your brand voice might want to answer to really draw customers in:</p> <ul> <li>What makes your brand different?</li> <li>How far is your brand willing to go to keep customers happy?</li> <li>Does your brand care for the community? How so?</li> </ul> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7133"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Internally, having an established voice also helps with marketing efforts. Creating content and handling community engagement online is a lot easier when a voice is developed. Captions and responses almost write themselves when you stick to a specific brand voice and identity.</p> <p>Whether you are new to the industry or a well established brand, developing a brand voice is a &#8220;must.&#8221; Now, it won&#8217;t come to you overnight but a good place to start would be to really think of what kind of brand you want to be. Figure out your brand&#8217;s core values, purpose, and goals and then tackle your brand&#8217;s voice and identity.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Need help with cohesive branding and marketing?

Whether you&#8217;re a student forced to write an essay, an author, or in this case, a blog writer &#8211; we&#8217;ve all been through it. And, I&#8217;m sure we can mutually agree that writer&#8217;s block is no fun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of us are able to take our sweet time when it comes to writing. Most times, we are writing to meet a deadline so taking a leisurely break is not always an option when writer&#8217;s block decides to creep in.  After years of writing article after article, I am excited to bring you three ways you can overcome writer&#8217;s fatigue from a blogger&#8217;s standpoint!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ways to Overcome Writer&#8217;s Block</h2> <h3> What&#8217;s Trending in Your Industry?</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7122"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Ask yourself this question if you are stumped on a blog topic. Every industry has something new and exciting going on, so train yourself to keep your eyes and ears peeled for trends and big changes.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not always easy keeping up with industry trends so I would suggest subscribing to reliable news outlets, blogs, or big name companies within your industry.</p> <p>Seek out popular and credible brands and bookmark them on your browser for convenience. These brands in particular have two jobs: to stay ahead of the curve and to inform those in the industry. With reliable references, you can deliver &#8220;trending right now&#8221; content to your readers. In turn, this will make your brand appear relevant and credible in the industry.</p> <h3>Just Write Something &#8211; Literally, Anything!</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7123"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""323"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Sometimes the best blogs come from nothing. People often say that overthinking kills creativity and that&#8217;s where writer&#8217;s block can stem from. The key to getting out of this rut is to just write something &#8211; with no plans or topic in mind.</p> <p>The &#8220;freestyle&#8221; approach is easier said than done but once you get in to the swing of it, the blog will almost write itself. The initial push is sometimes the only thing you need to get in to the routine of writing!</p> <h3>Read Blogs for Inspiration</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7124"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Reading blogs written by other people in your industry can really help cure writer&#8217;s fatigue simply because it will get your brain up and running.</p> <p>I tend to draw a lot of inspiration from other people&#8217;s blogs. In fact, this blog was actually inspired by 0 Ways to Overcome Writer’s Block When Blogging</a>.</p> <p>Reading other people&#8217;s opinion on something I am interested in is always eye opening but that doesn&#8217;t mean I always agree with them. When taking inspiration from blogs written by others, always remember to add your own flare and twist to it. Not only is plagiarism illegal, it is also just plain ole boring and unoriginal.</p> <p>Try reading someone else&#8217;s blog and then, write your own take on it featuring your own thoughts, perspectives, and experiences. If it&#8217;s a write-up that is not opinion-based but instead factual, try to present the topic in a different way. Change up the voice or the order to keep content fresh and original.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I cannot promise that these three techniques will keep writer&#8217;s block from happening again. But, I do hope that these tips will help you handle it better when it does strike back.

It is a time for our marketing team to sit down and collaborate, problem solve, and connect with each other!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Affects of Marketing Meetings</h2> <h3>Unplugged Discussions</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7094"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Like stated in the opener, when people think of the digital industry, they think of technology. However, with digital marketing, even though it is all on the internet, it is still marketing which means you are still aiming to sell to humans with real emotions and opinions.</p> <p>Having a designated time to &#8220;unplug&#8221; is needed in this industry. Even when brainstorming ideas for the digital space. Because the internet is massive, it is so easy to be influenced by what we see online.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being influenced and just flat out copying an idea. With an unplugged discussion, we are able to create authentic, out-of-the-box (or should we say, &#8220;off-of-the-screen&#8221;) marketing tactics and ideas.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Open Conversation</h3> <p>You&#8217;d think that we&#8217;d be transparent with each other simply because we spend nearly 8 hours a day together but that&#8217;s not the case at all. Since each person on our marketing team manages their own clients, it is super easy for each person to get lost in their own work.</p> <p>Having designated meeting days really help in forcing our team to step away from work and daily distractions and focus in on what&#8217;s on their minds. Weekly marketing meetings give our marketers a set day and time to share their projects, concerns, and goals. Ultimately, improving internal communication and understanding of each person&#8217;s role.</p> <h3>Bigger and Better Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7097"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Collaboration is the key to success! Digital marketing is an industry which thrives on relevancy and lifestyle. In an agency setting, we are often working with clients in industries we are not extremely knowledgeable in and that&#8217;s part of the fun! With co-workers coming from all walks of life, it is important to &#8216;put our heads together.&#8217;</p> <p>Working together gives you the opportunity to develop unique, never-done-before content. Every person has something to offer and sometimes, it takes a good brainstorming session to bring that out! And, that&#8217;s exactly how big, more effective marketing strategies are made.</p> <p>Weekly meetings have done a whole lot of good for us but these are the three biggest game changers! These highlighted benefits are great because they tap in to two very important parts of business, the internal side of things, along with effective execution (externally and internally). Regardless of what kind of business you run, we highly suggest hosting weekly or monthly meetings for each department. You&#8217;ll be amazed at the positive changes it will bring to the table.</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/"">What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Why Hire an App Development Agency? https://futureaccess.ca/why-hire-an-app-development-agency/ Jennifer Noun Tue, 14 May 2019 18:01:37 +0000 App Development https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7032 <p>As the need for apps continues to grow, so does the competition in the app development industry.

So, this is why we want to help you make the right decision when it comes to picking your perfect app developer or team.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons You Should Hire a Local App Development Agency</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg"" alt=""man coding on laptop in an office"" width=""600"" height=""400"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p><strong>1. Dedication</strong></p> <p>It comes with no surprise that when you hire an app developer from a local agency, they are 100% committed and dedicated to working with you. A developer from an agency has guidelines and expectations he or she must reach, usually based on industry standards. This ultimately impacts the overall quality. Another perk that comes with this is peace of mind! You can rest easy knowing that your app is in the hands of an experienced team.</p> <p><strong>2. Organization</strong></p> <p>Most specialized agencies have project managers which help keep the project running smoothly. The project manager usually oversees and communicates what&#8217;s going on, what should happen next, and any concerns that may arise. Not only will the communication be a lot smoother with a project manager involved, you will feel a sense of comfort knowing that your agency of choice is organized, internally. Having a project manager involved also ensures cost effectiveness. He or she is in charge of keeping the project in scope at all times!</p> <p><strong>3. Fixed Pricing</strong></p> <p>Freelancers typically charge hourly &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a bad thing but you might be able to get more bang for your buck working alongside an agency. Agencies typically have fixed prices or bundles available. These bundled deals are created based on an entire scope of a project, from start to finish. This will give you a good idea of budget and how long it takes to develop an app from scratch!</p> <p>With a fixed price, you don&#8217;t have to constantly stress about hours and how much you have to pay each day. Fixed pricing gives you an exact budget and a list of services you can expect to receive during and after the project is complete.</p> <p>Interested in learning more about app development?

It is extremely important to know how to write an email that is easy to understand, kind, and straight to the point. After a few years of replying to thousands and thousands of emails, it is safe to say that we&#8217;ve gained some skills in this particular department &#8211; let&#8217;s dive in!</p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7024"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/man-typing-out-an-email-on-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How to Write Better Emails</h2> <h3>1. Get to the Point</h3> <p>To avoid potential miscommunication, you can never go wrong with getting straight to the point. If you feel like your email comes off a little too straight forward, don&#8217;t be afraid to add a kind transitional sentence like:</p> <p><em>&#8220;Hi there! I&#8217;m sure you are very busy today so I&#8217;ll  just get right to the point&#8230;&#8221;</em></p> <h3>2. One Big Suggestion or Idea Per Email</h3> <p>Including only one &#8220;big idea&#8221; in an email is ideal; it makes it easier for you and the other person to get on the same page quicker, ultimately eliminating potential mishaps. After the initial greeting portion of the email, try to propose your idea with transitions such as:</p> <p><em>&#8220;The ideal solution is&#8230;&#8221;, &#8221; The key takeaway is&#8230;&#8221;,</em> or <em>&#8220;Here is what I&#8217;d suggest&#8230;&#8221;. </em></p> <h3>3. Avoid Open-Ended Questions</h3> <p>Cut to the chase and be confident with the questions you are asking. Although it might be obvious to you, humans are not mind readers, let them know what the next steps are. Example:</p> <p><em>&#8220;I believe launching the new marketing campaign next month would be beneficial. If you agree please reply with &#8220;Yes&#8221;, if not, please reply &#8220;No&#8221; and explain your reasoning. Thank you.&#8221; </em></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7026"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""311"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woman-writing-out-an-email-on-her-laptop-300x156.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p>We understand that writing emails might not be everyone&#8217;s strong suit, this is exactly why we chose to touch on this topic.

Instead of an awkward, let&#8217;s-talk-business situation, we opted for a more casual approach to make sure everyone feels comfortable.</p> <p>After hosting a few bi-monthly sessions we realized just how important it is to have these scheduled conversations and discussions. The impact team brainstorming has made on our team and the overall office environment has been very beneficial for us, and this is why we want to share with you the importance of creative team brainstorming as a business.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons to Brainstorm as a Team</h2> <h3>Team Building</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-6977 alignright"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Team building is a topic we&#8217;ve touched on numerous times in our blogs and on social media. If you&#8217;re a Future Access follower, you would know that we host bi-monthly team Game Days to encourage team building in a fun and interactive way.</p> <p>Game Days have proven to be quite successful in helping our team bond but because we are so occupied by fun activities, it doesn&#8217;t give us a chance to talk a whole lot of business.</p> <p>Team Beer and Brainstorming sessions allows us to team build on a completely different level &#8211; one that is still casual, yet serious and more relevant to our industry and business goals. It gave us the opportunity to share our thoughts and where we hope to see Future Access in the future.</p> <h3>Different Perspectives and Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6979"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Brainstorming as a team means that there are a collection of different thoughts, opinions, perspectives, and ideas. Although that may seem overwhelming, it can also be very helpful, especially if ideas are becoming stale.</p> <p>Stale ideas tend to stem from a single person generating ideas. And, although that person might have fantastic ideas, its always nice to take a peek at what goes on in other people&#8217;s heads.</p> <p>Making Beer and Brainstorming sessions a regular thing at Future Access has allowed us to see things in a different light. Sometimes, we as human beings get so stuck in our own heads. Opening up this conversations gives team members of different departments an opportunity to share fresh, unbiased ideas.</p> <h3>Improved Critical Thinking</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6983"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />With team brainstorming sessions comes positive and negative honesty &#8211; which is not a bad thing!  Sharing concerns and problems forces us to practice our critical thinking and problem solving skills. This is a skill you want to encourage to further personal and team growth.</p> <p>At Future Access, it is pretty incredible to hear the innovative ideas our team members come up with. When a problem is presented, you can see each one of our team members processing the problem and coming up with an unbiased and logical solution.</p> <p>Now, this skill takes time to develop but with every Beer and Brainstorming session we have, there is a visible difference. Our problem solving skills are quicker and come from a more logical and well-thought out place.</p> <p>In doing these casual meetings, we found out that most of our team members have very similar goals. Now that we are aware of that, we are able to help each other succeed in reaching those achievements. Our work ethic and communication has improved tremendously and our goal for Future Access as a whole has never been clearer. This is why we want to encourage businesses of all kinds to try out monthly or bi-monthly brainstorming sessions! After all, they do say that &#8220;Two heads are better than one.&#8221;</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-importance-of-creative-team-brainstorming/"">The Importance of Creative Team Brainstorming</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You? https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/ Jennifer Noun Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:04:47 +0000 E-commerce Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=6869 <p>Facebook Store is an add-on functionality that Facebook has recently added to their popular social network platform.

The Facebook Store can be added to new or existing Facebook Business Pages, allowing business&#8217; to sell their product directly on Facebook.</p> <p>Although they have not out right said it themselves, it is pretty clear to us that Facebook created Facebook Store with the goal of growing their ever-transforming platform, while providing an easy-to-use and understand selling option for small or big businesses.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Need to Know About Facebook Store (Canada)</h2> <h3>Facebook Store Set Up</h3> <p><strong>Start from Scratch</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6906"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/laptop-and-smartphone-with-facebook-displayed-e1549997396421.jpg"" alt=""likes, comments, and friend invites on facebook shown on laptop and smartphone"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />Facebook gives you the option to use their platform as an online shop, kind of like a simplified eCommerce website. This means, business&#8217; now have the ability to sell directly on Facebook.</p> <p>When starting a Facebook Store from scratch, you will have the ability to add, remove, update, or edit inventory manually as you please, as well as the option to communicate payment and delivery details via Facebook Messenger.</p> <p><strong>Connect an eCommerce Platform</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6914"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg"" alt=""woman on ecommerce website on her ipad"" width=""450"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg 450w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"" />To make set-up easier for brands that might already have an online shop, Facebook has teamed up with big eCommerce websites such as Shopify.</p> <p>If you already have products on a partnering eCommerce website, Facebook Store gives you the ability to link the two platforms together.</p> <p>This means, you can connect your Shopify products without having to rewrite product descriptions and prices. This feature in particular makes inventory management super easy.</p> <h3>Cost of Running a Facebook Store</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6908"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/couple-sitting-on-floor-taking-product-photos-of-clothing-e1549997702587.jpg"" alt=""couple surrounded by packaging boxes while taking product photos of fashion items"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, you would know that Facebook is a free social platform. Creating a Facebook Business Page is also a free feature that Facebook offers- and yes, that includes the Store tab add-on too!</p> <p>Unlike Etsy or eBay, Facebook Store is free when it comes to listing items. It is safe to say that Facebook Store is a fees free alternative.</p> <p><strong>How can Facebook offer a fees free shop option?</strong> Simply by not offering a built-in payment process and delivery option for Canadian-based Facebook Stores. Finding a payment method and delivery service will be your responsibility and there might be a cost to manage that part of business.</p> <h3>Is Facebook Store the Right Choice for You?</h3> <p><strong>Pros of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>It&#8217;s a cheap alternative to a &#8220;website&#8221;</li> <li>It&#8217;s easy to navigate and users are familiar with the platform already</li> <li>A great alternative for the non-tech savvy shop owners and customers out there</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is a lack of customization options</li> <li>A payment method and delivery option is not included</li> </ul> <p>Now you decide &#8211; is Facebook Store appropriate for your business? Your audience? Your products? Yes the low risk cost is hard to resist but remember, the first impression of a business is very important.

At Future Access, we’ve put considerable thought into keeping our employees safe while ensuring our clients are receiving the level of service they’ve come to expect from us.</p> <p>Some of the ways we’ve adapted to COVID-19 include:</p> <ul> <li>Continuing to allow for staff to work remotely;</li> <li>Staff who opt to come in have their workstations sanitized frequently;</li> <li>All high touch surfaces in the office are sanitized often;</li> <li>For Staff and Clients&#8217; safety, all in-person meetings with clients have changed to virtual meetings through Zoho Meeting, Google Meet, Zoom, Go to Meeting or other platforms.</li> </ul> <p>We also look at the current situation as an opportunity to address commonly held beliefs. One of these (long-held) beliefs is offices should be open between Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm. Although this concept is ingrained in Canadian culture, it’s assumed the most effective method for both Staff and Clients. We have to question ourselves and ask:</p> <p><em>“Is working five days a week the best approach in serving our Staff and Clients?”</em></p> <p>With an evidence-based approach and in our constant efforts in creating the best possible work environment for our staff, we’ve decided to conduct a trial 4-day work week for June.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Starting June 1, our staff will work from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 5 pm.</strong></p> <h3>Why Have You Decided to Conduct this Trial?</h3> <p>There are a variety of reasons, including:</p> <p><strong>Better Work-Life Balance</strong></p> <p>Giving employees an extra personal day allows them to work on personal projects and hobbies and spend more time with families. Working long hours contributes to stress, which in turn can have negative health effects on employees. Improved work-life balance helps employees be healthier and ready to work.</p> <p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></p> <p>Employees are more productive when given time to rest and relax adequately. Employees will be less burnt out from long working hours and will be more productive at their jobs.</p> <p><strong>Competitive advantage for hiring</strong></p> <p>A four-day workweek is also a competitive advantage for employees as they value work-life balance and flexible scheduling.</p> <h3>What Are You Basing this Information On?</h3> <p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40"">Microsoft Japan</a> did a great case study for the benefits of a four-day work week in the summer of 2019. Employees there worked four days a week while receiving their regular five-day paycheque. They reported increased efficiency across the business. Decreased electricity usage, fewer meetings held, and fewer pages printed helped contribute. Microsoft reported this all resulted in a 40% productivity boost across the business. Microsoft Japan isn&#8217;t the only business or country that has tried this either. Another well-known example is of a New Zealand trust management company called Perpetual Guardian. After switching to a four-day work week with a normal week&#8217;s salary, they reported a <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-idea-for-the-new-decade-4-day-week-phenomenon-told-in-new-book-300934244.html"">20% gain in employee</a> Perpetual Guardian also saw a 27% reduction in work stress levels and a 45% increase in work-life balance. In examining the results, they decided to make the policy permanent.</p> <h3>What if I Need Support?</h3> <p>On Fridays in June, telephone calls and emails will still be answered by the owners, Tricia and Chris Tollins, for support, just as there is currently support for critical issues on evenings and weekends.</p> <h3>Will My Project Still be Done on Time?</h3> <p>Yes! We’ve been expecting the transition to a 4-day work week and have based our timelines on that assumption.</p> <h3>Is This Permanent?</h3> <p>We’re conducting the 4-day work week as a trial. It&#8217;s a new concept for everyone, so we want to ensure we’re meeting the needs of both staff and clients alike. Should the trial prove to be successful, we will extend it until August 31 and re-evaluate then.</p> <h3>Is the 4-Day Work Week a Cost Saving Measure?</h3> <p>No, staff wages will remain the same. The 4-day work week is to better the health and wellness of our staff while ensuring our clients receive the same quality service.</p> <h3>In Review</h3> <p>The 4-day work week trial begins in June, where staff will continue to work Monday through Thursday, 9 am to 5 pm. Tricia and Chris Tollins will continue to be available for telephone calls and email on Fridays, with emergency support offered on evenings and weekends.</p> <p>We will evaluate this trial in the month of June by ensuring:</p> <ul> <li>Clients’ needs are consistently met;</li> <li>Milestones and deadlines are being achieved on time;</li> <li>There is a net-zero negative impact on business;</li> <li>Employee satisfaction increases; and,</li> <li>There is a significant increase in productivity.</li> </ul> <p>Future Access believes a 4-day workweek is an ethical business decision for our staff that will have no negative impact on projects or clients. We’re excited about this endeavour and hope this trial will become permanent.</p> <p><em>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me at (905) 323-9818.</em></p> <p>Be well,</p> <p>Chris</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-4-day-work-week/"">The 4-Day Work Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/ Future Access Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:24:19 +0000 Uncategorised email gsuite office 365 canadian web hosting https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7500 <p>We announced in 2019 that we will be migrating our client websites from our current web hosting provider to the Google Cloud Platform.

We’re excited about this! Google Cloud offers tremendous value, including fast loading times, scalability for increases in traffic, and some of the best security features of any web hosting platform available.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This change is part of our mission to always find ways to deliver greater value to our customers. There’s just one hitch: with our transition to Google Cloud, we are no longer able to offer email hosting services. Because of this, anyone who hosts their email with us will have to transition to another provider.  </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not to worry, though. In the interest of saving you time, our team has researched and reviewed many of the email hosting options available and has come up with what we think are the three best options based on criteria such as service, speed, security, price, additional offerings and best overall value*. Let’s dive in!</span></p> <h4><b>Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Available as a separate service from its web hosting offering, Google offers a comprehensive email hosting package for businesses. Google’s Gmail for business is safe, secure, offers 24/7 support, and its basic package comes with a range of additional features such as video and voice conferencing, secure team messaging, shared calendars, software for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations, 30GB of cloud storage, and more. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gmail for business is quick to set up and syncs with Microsoft Outlook, so you can migrate old emails. Google also guarantees 99.9% uptime with 0% planned downtime. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Google offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basic – $7.80</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Business – $15.60</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enterprise – $23.40</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Google’s business email service, </span><a href=""https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_ca/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Microsoft Office 365</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft’s Exchange Online program is designed to provide flexibility and a range of options to suit the needs of any business. Whether you need only email hosting or a full suite of professional business products and services, Microsoft’s Exchange Online program has you covered. The basic plan includes 50GB of mailbox storage, the ability to send emails that are up to 150 MB in size, a web-based version of Outlook, the ability to compare calendars to schedule meetings, premium security features, and automatic archiving. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microsoft offers three pricing options per user per month. Each option requires an annual commitment. </span></p> <ul> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 1) – $5.10</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exchange Online (Plan 2) – $10.20</span></li> <li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Office 365 Business Premium (includes Office applications) – $16.00</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Microsoft’s Exchange Online program, </span><a href=""https://products.office.com/en-ca/exchange/email""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p> <h4><b>Canadian Web Hosting</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most affordable options we could find is the homegrown company Canadian Web Hosting. For only $3 per user per month, Canadian Web Hosting provides you with custom email addresses, 24/7 support, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, 5 GB mailbox storage, migration support, anti-spam, and anti-virus services, shared calendaring and contacts, Outlook for desktop, mobile and webmail access, and a control panel for your network administrator. Canadian Web Hosting even provides discounts for clients with 50 or more users and offers a variety of additional web hosting services. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information on Canadian Web Hosting’s service, </span><a href=""https://www.canadianwebhosting.com/hosting/hosted_email""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">click here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <h4><b>Future Access is Here for You</b></h4> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have questions or comments about our move to Google Cloud or any other aspect of our services, please contact us at 905-323-9818 or </span><a href=""mailto:info@futureaccess.ca""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">info@futureaccess.ca</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">*Email hosting prices, products and services are accurate as of the date of publication.</span></em></p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/three-great-options-for-your-email-hosting/"">Three Great Options for Your Email Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Updating WordPress to use HTTPS https://futureaccess.ca/updating-wordpress-to-use-https/ Future Access Thu, 17 Oct 2019 14:32:38 +0000 Uncategorised Web Design Tips Website https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7391 <p>Need a hand setting up your WordPress website to use HTTPS?

Our quick guide will walk you through the main steps to get this taken care. However, depending on the complexity of your site and how it was developed, <em>there might be a few additional steps which aren&#8217;t covered in this guide</em>. Also, please note that as WordPress is updated, these screenshots and instructions may become outdated.</p> <h3>Setting up an SSL for your Website</h3> <p>With a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) installed on your website, you can enable HTTPS which will then protect sensitive data (such as contact form data) from being intercepted as the data passes through the internet.  It&#8217;s also a contributing factor to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for a website, so it&#8217;s not only good for your customers, but it&#8217;s also good for you! When your site is secure it adds an image of a lock beside your URL:</p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-7392 alignnone"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png"" alt=""HTTPS SSL example"" width=""452"" height=""35"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example.png 452w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-HTTPS-SSL-Example-300x23.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"" /></p> <p>All websites <a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/website-hosting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hosted and developed by Future Access</a> come equipped with a SSL immediately.</p> <h3>Enabling HTTPS on your WordPress Website</h3> <p>To enable HTTPS on your WordPress website, you need to make sure that all links on your website point to HTTPS and not HTTP. There are a couple of ways you can do this. You can:</p> <ol> <li><a href=""https://futureaccess.ca/contact/"">contact us</a> and we can take care of it for you!</li> <li>install a plugin which can update all HTTP links to HTTPS</li> </ol> <h3>Use a Plugin to update your Website to use HTTPS</h3> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p> <p>On a WordPress website, there is a plugin that we like to use called &#8220;Better Search Replace&#8221; (developed by Delicious Brains).

Take Nike for an example. Nike is a brand which focuses on athleticism and really solidified their voice and identity once their &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; campaign took off.</p> <p>&#8220;Just Do It&#8221; showcases Nike&#8217;s encouraging, yet stern voice. Basically playing the role of a friend or partner wanting to help you (the customer) reach your physical goals.</p> <p>Another example is Google and Apple. Google has more of a problem solver voice, they want to help you in any way possible. Meanwhile, Apple has more of a friendly but confident voice. They want to make life easier for you and are confident in their abilities (and products) to make that happen.</p> <p>We like to describe Future Access&#8217; voice as personable and willing to help. You can get hints of our vibe from just the way we carry ourselves online and in-person!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is a Brand Voice?</h2> <p>Your brand voice is your brand&#8217;s identity. Your brand voice helps customers understand your core values, mission, and standards without having to do a deep dive in to research. A brand voice helps in making your brand appear more &#8220;human,&#8221; therefore making it easier for customers to connect and relate to.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is having a Brand Voice Important?</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7132"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-carrying-shopping-bags-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />When people find a brand that they can relate to, they tend to keep coming back. This builds a strong and loyal fan base. If the brand voice is used across all media platforms (on and offline), it doesn&#8217;t just make the brand appear cohesive but it will also train the public.</p> <p>People will eventually know what to expect from your brand and if done right, will then associate your brand with a specific word or feeling. This is a good thing because your brand will always be in mind even if its not being directly advertised.</p> <p>Beyond loyalty and being top of mind, a brand voice is very important to have as it can set you apart from your competitors. Like stated previously, your customers should be able to identify your core values, mission, and standards, making it easy for them to weigh out the pros and cons of your brand vs. a competitor&#8217;s. Here are some example questions your brand voice might want to answer to really draw customers in:</p> <ul> <li>What makes your brand different?</li> <li>How far is your brand willing to go to keep customers happy?</li> <li>Does your brand care for the community? How so?</li> </ul> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7133"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/desk-with-camera-and-laptop-with-facebook-ads-on-screen-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Internally, having an established voice also helps with marketing efforts. Creating content and handling community engagement online is a lot easier when a voice is developed. Captions and responses almost write themselves when you stick to a specific brand voice and identity.</p> <p>Whether you are new to the industry or a well established brand, developing a brand voice is a &#8220;must.&#8221; Now, it won&#8217;t come to you overnight but a good place to start would be to really think of what kind of brand you want to be. Figure out your brand&#8217;s core values, purpose, and goals and then tackle your brand&#8217;s voice and identity.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Need help with cohesive branding and marketing?

Whether you&#8217;re a student forced to write an essay, an author, or in this case, a blog writer &#8211; we&#8217;ve all been through it. And, I&#8217;m sure we can mutually agree that writer&#8217;s block is no fun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of us are able to take our sweet time when it comes to writing. Most times, we are writing to meet a deadline so taking a leisurely break is not always an option when writer&#8217;s block decides to creep in.  After years of writing article after article, I am excited to bring you three ways you can overcome writer&#8217;s fatigue from a blogger&#8217;s standpoint!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ways to Overcome Writer&#8217;s Block</h2> <h3> What&#8217;s Trending in Your Industry?</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7122"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-with-a-cup-of-coffee-reading-a-magazine-outside-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Ask yourself this question if you are stumped on a blog topic. Every industry has something new and exciting going on, so train yourself to keep your eyes and ears peeled for trends and big changes.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not always easy keeping up with industry trends so I would suggest subscribing to reliable news outlets, blogs, or big name companies within your industry.</p> <p>Seek out popular and credible brands and bookmark them on your browser for convenience. These brands in particular have two jobs: to stay ahead of the curve and to inform those in the industry. With reliable references, you can deliver &#8220;trending right now&#8221; content to your readers. In turn, this will make your brand appear relevant and credible in the industry.</p> <h3>Just Write Something &#8211; Literally, Anything!</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7123"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""323"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/open-notebook-and-laptop-on-a-desk-300x225.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Sometimes the best blogs come from nothing. People often say that overthinking kills creativity and that&#8217;s where writer&#8217;s block can stem from. The key to getting out of this rut is to just write something &#8211; with no plans or topic in mind.</p> <p>The &#8220;freestyle&#8221; approach is easier said than done but once you get in to the swing of it, the blog will almost write itself. The initial push is sometimes the only thing you need to get in to the routine of writing!</p> <h3>Read Blogs for Inspiration</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7124"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/woman-reading-a-blog-on-ipad-for-inspiration-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Reading blogs written by other people in your industry can really help cure writer&#8217;s fatigue simply because it will get your brain up and running.</p> <p>I tend to draw a lot of inspiration from other people&#8217;s blogs. In fact, this blog was actually inspired by 0 Ways to Overcome Writer’s Block When Blogging</a>.</p> <p>Reading other people&#8217;s opinion on something I am interested in is always eye opening but that doesn&#8217;t mean I always agree with them. When taking inspiration from blogs written by others, always remember to add your own flare and twist to it. Not only is plagiarism illegal, it is also just plain ole boring and unoriginal.</p> <p>Try reading someone else&#8217;s blog and then, write your own take on it featuring your own thoughts, perspectives, and experiences. If it&#8217;s a write-up that is not opinion-based but instead factual, try to present the topic in a different way. Change up the voice or the order to keep content fresh and original.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I cannot promise that these three techniques will keep writer&#8217;s block from happening again. But, I do hope that these tips will help you handle it better when it does strike back. Happy writing fellow bloggers!</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/overcoming-writers-block-as-a-blog-writer/"">Overcoming Writer&#8217;s Block as a Blog Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/ Jennifer Noun Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:13 +0000 Future Access Team Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7067 <p>When people think of the digital industry, they often think about technology.

Technology has successfully replaced many human jobs in numerous industries, the one thing it cannot replace is the power of creative collaboration. At Future Access, we believe that the digital marketing industry should always have a social element to it.</p> <p>To ensure our marketing strategies are &#8220;human&#8221; and easy to relate to, we have implemented weekly marketing meetings. Marketing meetings are specifically for our digital marketing team. It is a time for our marketing team to sit down and collaborate, problem solve, and connect with each other!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Affects of Marketing Meetings</h2> <h3>Unplugged Discussions</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7094"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hands-holding-mugs-full-of-coffee-on-a-desk-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Like stated in the opener, when people think of the digital industry, they think of technology. However, with digital marketing, even though it is all on the internet, it is still marketing which means you are still aiming to sell to humans with real emotions and opinions.</p> <p>Having a designated time to &#8220;unplug&#8221; is needed in this industry. Even when brainstorming ideas for the digital space. Because the internet is massive, it is so easy to be influenced by what we see online.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being influenced and just flat out copying an idea. With an unplugged discussion, we are able to create authentic, out-of-the-box (or should we say, &#8220;off-of-the-screen&#8221;) marketing tactics and ideas.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Open Conversation</h3> <p>You&#8217;d think that we&#8217;d be transparent with each other simply because we spend nearly 8 hours a day together but that&#8217;s not the case at all. Since each person on our marketing team manages their own clients, it is super easy for each person to get lost in their own work.</p> <p>Having designated meeting days really help in forcing our team to step away from work and daily distractions and focus in on what&#8217;s on their minds. Weekly marketing meetings give our marketers a set day and time to share their projects, concerns, and goals. Ultimately, improving internal communication and understanding of each person&#8217;s role.</p> <h3>Bigger and Better Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7097"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/women-in-marketing-meeting-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Collaboration is the key to success! Digital marketing is an industry which thrives on relevancy and lifestyle. In an agency setting, we are often working with clients in industries we are not extremely knowledgeable in and that&#8217;s part of the fun! With co-workers coming from all walks of life, it is important to &#8216;put our heads together.&#8217;</p> <p>Working together gives you the opportunity to develop unique, never-done-before content. Every person has something to offer and sometimes, it takes a good brainstorming session to bring that out! And, that&#8217;s exactly how big, more effective marketing strategies are made.</p> <p>Weekly meetings have done a whole lot of good for us but these are the three biggest game changers! These highlighted benefits are great because they tap in to two very important parts of business, the internal side of things, along with effective execution (externally and internally). Regardless of what kind of business you run, we highly suggest hosting weekly or monthly meetings for each department. You&#8217;ll be amazed at the positive changes it will bring to the table.</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-weekly-marketing-meetings-have-taught-us/"">What Weekly Marketing Meetings Have Taught Us</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  Why Hire an App Development Agency? https://futureaccess.ca/why-hire-an-app-development-agency/ Jennifer Noun Tue, 14 May 2019 18:01:37 +0000 App Development https://futureaccess.ca/?p=7032 <p>As the need for apps continues to grow, so does the competition in the app development industry.

So, this is why we want to help you make the right decision when it comes to picking your perfect app developer or team.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons You Should Hire a Local App Development Agency</h2> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7047"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg"" alt=""man coding on laptop in an office"" width=""600"" height=""400"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop.jpg 600w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-developer-doing-css-coding-on-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" /></p> <p><strong>1. Dedication</strong></p> <p>It comes with no surprise that when you hire an app developer from a local agency, they are 100% committed and dedicated to working with you. A developer from an agency has guidelines and expectations he or she must reach, usually based on industry standards. This ultimately impacts the overall quality. Another perk that comes with this is peace of mind! You can rest easy knowing that your app is in the hands of an experienced team.</p> <p><strong>2. Organization</strong></p> <p>Most specialized agencies have project managers which help keep the project running smoothly. The project manager usually oversees and communicates what&#8217;s going on, what should happen next, and any concerns that may arise. Not only will the communication be a lot smoother with a project manager involved, you will feel a sense of comfort knowing that your agency of choice is organized, internally. Having a project manager involved also ensures cost effectiveness. He or she is in charge of keeping the project in scope at all times!</p> <p><strong>3. Fixed Pricing</strong></p> <p>Freelancers typically charge hourly &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a bad thing but you might be able to get more bang for your buck working alongside an agency. Agencies typically have fixed prices or bundles available. These bundled deals are created based on an entire scope of a project, from start to finish. This will give you a good idea of budget and how long it takes to develop an app from scratch!</p> <p>With a fixed price, you don&#8217;t have to constantly stress about hours and how much you have to pay each day. Fixed pricing gives you an exact budget and a list of services you can expect to receive during and after the project is complete.</p> <p>Interested in learning more about app development?

One Big Suggestion or Idea Per Email</h3> <p>Including only one &#8220;big idea&#8221; in an email is ideal; it makes it easier for you and the other person to get on the same page quicker, ultimately eliminating potential mishaps. After the initial greeting portion of the email, try to propose your idea with transitions such as:</p> <p><em>&#8220;The ideal solution is&#8230;&#8221;, &#8221; The key takeaway is&#8230;&#8221;,</em> or <em>&#8220;Here is what I&#8217;d suggest&#8230;&#8221;. </em></p> <h3>3. Avoid Open-Ended Questions</h3> <p>Cut to the chase and be confident with the questions you are asking. Although it might be obvious to you, humans are not mind readers, let them know what the next steps are. Example:</p> <p><em>&#8220;I believe launching the new marketing campaign next month would be beneficial. If you agree please reply with &#8220;Yes&#8221;, if not, please reply &#8220;No&#8221; and explain your reasoning.

Instead of an awkward, let&#8217;s-talk-business situation, we opted for a more casual approach to make sure everyone feels comfortable.</p> <p>After hosting a few bi-monthly sessions we realized just how important it is to have these scheduled conversations and discussions. The impact team brainstorming has made on our team and the overall office environment has been very beneficial for us, and this is why we want to share with you the importance of creative team brainstorming as a business.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">3 Reasons to Brainstorm as a Team</h2> <h3>Team Building</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-6977 alignright"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-hand-stack-team-building-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Team building is a topic we&#8217;ve touched on numerous times in our blogs and on social media. If you&#8217;re a Future Access follower, you would know that we host bi-monthly team Game Days to encourage team building in a fun and interactive way.</p> <p>Game Days have proven to be quite successful in helping our team bond but because we are so occupied by fun activities, it doesn&#8217;t give us a chance to talk a whole lot of business.</p> <p>Team Beer and Brainstorming sessions allows us to team build on a completely different level &#8211; one that is still casual, yet serious and more relevant to our industry and business goals. It gave us the opportunity to share our thoughts and where we hope to see Future Access in the future.</p> <h3>Different Perspectives and Ideas</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6979"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""286"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/team-having-a-casual-meeting-discussion-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />Brainstorming as a team means that there are a collection of different thoughts, opinions, perspectives, and ideas. Although that may seem overwhelming, it can also be very helpful, especially if ideas are becoming stale.</p> <p>Stale ideas tend to stem from a single person generating ideas. And, although that person might have fantastic ideas, its always nice to take a peek at what goes on in other people&#8217;s heads.</p> <p>Making Beer and Brainstorming sessions a regular thing at Future Access has allowed us to see things in a different light. Sometimes, we as human beings get so stuck in our own heads. Opening up this conversations gives team members of different departments an opportunity to share fresh, unbiased ideas.</p> <h3>Improved Critical Thinking</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6983"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg"" alt="""" width=""430"" height=""287"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team.jpg 430w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/critical-thinking-as-a-team-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"" />With team brainstorming sessions comes positive and negative honesty &#8211; which is not a bad thing!  Sharing concerns and problems forces us to practice our critical thinking and problem solving skills. This is a skill you want to encourage to further personal and team growth.</p> <p>At Future Access, it is pretty incredible to hear the innovative ideas our team members come up with. When a problem is presented, you can see each one of our team members processing the problem and coming up with an unbiased and logical solution.</p> <p>Now, this skill takes time to develop but with every Beer and Brainstorming session we have, there is a visible difference. Our problem solving skills are quicker and come from a more logical and well-thought out place.</p> <p>In doing these casual meetings, we found out that most of our team members have very similar goals. Now that we are aware of that, we are able to help each other succeed in reaching those achievements. Our work ethic and communication has improved tremendously and our goal for Future Access as a whole has never been clearer. This is why we want to encourage businesses of all kinds to try out monthly or bi-monthly brainstorming sessions! After all, they do say that &#8220;Two heads are better than one.&#8221;</p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/the-importance-of-creative-team-brainstorming/"">The Importance of Creative Team Brainstorming</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>  What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You? https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/ Jennifer Noun Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:04:47 +0000 E-commerce Digital Marketing https://futureaccess.ca/?p=6869 <p>Facebook Store is an add-on functionality that Facebook has recently added to their popular social network platform.

The Facebook Store can be added to new or existing Facebook Business Pages, allowing business&#8217; to sell their product directly on Facebook.</p> <p>Although they have not out right said it themselves, it is pretty clear to us that Facebook created Facebook Store with the goal of growing their ever-transforming platform, while providing an easy-to-use and understand selling option for small or big businesses.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Need to Know About Facebook Store (Canada)</h2> <h3>Facebook Store Set Up</h3> <p><strong>Start from Scratch</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6906"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/laptop-and-smartphone-with-facebook-displayed-e1549997396421.jpg"" alt=""likes, comments, and friend invites on facebook shown on laptop and smartphone"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />Facebook gives you the option to use their platform as an online shop, kind of like a simplified eCommerce website. This means, business&#8217; now have the ability to sell directly on Facebook.</p> <p>When starting a Facebook Store from scratch, you will have the ability to add, remove, update, or edit inventory manually as you please, as well as the option to communicate payment and delivery details via Facebook Messenger.</p> <p><strong>Connect an eCommerce Platform</strong></p> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6914"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg"" alt=""woman on ecommerce website on her ipad"" width=""450"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad.jpg 450w, https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/woman-online-shopping-on-ipad-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"" />To make set-up easier for brands that might already have an online shop, Facebook has teamed up with big eCommerce websites such as Shopify.</p> <p>If you already have products on a partnering eCommerce website, Facebook Store gives you the ability to link the two platforms together.</p> <p>This means, you can connect your Shopify products without having to rewrite product descriptions and prices. This feature in particular makes inventory management super easy.</p> <h3>Cost of Running a Facebook Store</h3> <p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-6908"" src=""https://futureaccess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/couple-sitting-on-floor-taking-product-photos-of-clothing-e1549997702587.jpg"" alt=""couple surrounded by packaging boxes while taking product photos of fashion items"" width=""450"" height=""300"" />If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, you would know that Facebook is a free social platform. Creating a Facebook Business Page is also a free feature that Facebook offers- and yes, that includes the Store tab add-on too!</p> <p>Unlike Etsy or eBay, Facebook Store is free when it comes to listing items. It is safe to say that Facebook Store is a fees free alternative.</p> <p><strong>How can Facebook offer a fees free shop option?</strong> Simply by not offering a built-in payment process and delivery option for Canadian-based Facebook Stores. Finding a payment method and delivery service will be your responsibility and there might be a cost to manage that part of business.</p> <h3>Is Facebook Store the Right Choice for You?</h3> <p><strong>Pros of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>It&#8217;s a cheap alternative to a &#8220;website&#8221;</li> <li>It&#8217;s easy to navigate and users are familiar with the platform already</li> <li>A great alternative for the non-tech savvy shop owners and customers out there</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons of Facebook Store (Canada):</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is a lack of customization options</li> <li>A payment method and delivery option is not included</li> </ul> <p>Now you decide &#8211; is Facebook Store appropriate for your business? Your audience? Your products? Yes the low risk cost is hard to resist but remember, the first impression of a business is very important. It is valuable to do your research and explore your options.</p> <p><center><a class=""button pink btnQuote"" href=""#"">Let&#8217;s work together to build your online store!</a></center></p> <p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca/what-is-facebook-store-and-is-it-right-for-you/"">What is Facebook Store and Is It Right For You?</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://futureaccess.ca"">Future Access Inc.</a>.</p>",0.18945260155994376,0.5048306964617373,Positive,Subjective
