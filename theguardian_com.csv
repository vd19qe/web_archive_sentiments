Data from the trial on more than 1,000 severely ill patients in 75 hospitals around the world show that patients put on the drug recovered 31% faster than similar patients who were given a placebo drug instead. Remdesivir cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11. Scientists also suggested the drug could have an effect on survival. In the group on the drug, 8% died, compared with 11% among those given a placebo. Remdesivir, made by the US company Gilead, is not a cure for Covid-19 and these results must be confirmed by more data, but experts think it could potentially help those who are acutely ill, probably in combination with other drugs that are yet to be shown to work. Multiple trials are taking place in hospitals around the world. An earlier trial of the drug, in patients with severe illness in China, showed no effect, but it was stopped early because insufficient numbers of people could be recruited as the epidemic tailed off. The new trial was sponsored by the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Dr Anthony Fauci, a top US public health official, on Wednesday called the early results “quite good news”. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Fauci said. “This will be the standard of care.” Patients in the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-EU/UK), launched at the start of April, received remdesivir or a placebo through a drip every day for 10 days. It aimed to recruit 440 patients but ended up with more than twice that number. World's stock markets soar on coronavirus treatment hopes Read more Recovery in this study was defined in three ways: being well enough to come off oxygen despite remaining in hospital; being well enough for hospital discharge although not quite back to normal health; or being out of hospital and returned to normal activity levels. In the trial, patients were given remdesivir every day for 10 days while they remained in hospital. Professor Mahesh Parmar, director of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, who has overseen the trial in the EU, said: “This is the first large-scale international trial to report on the use of the drug remdisivir to treat patients hospitalised with Covid-19. “These results are very promising indeed. They show that this drug can clearly improve time to recovery. Before this drug can be made more widely available, a number of things need to happen: the data and results need to be reviewed by the regulators to assess whether the drug can be licensed and then they need assessment by the relevant health authorities in various countries. While this is happening we will obtain more and longer-term data from this trial, and other ones, on whether the drug also prevents deaths from Covid-19.” Experts agreed the results were hopeful. Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, is running the Recovery trial of repurposed drugs that could be useful in Covid-19. He hopes to include remdesivir but has not yet managed to secure supplies because of global demand. He was involved in a trial of the drug in China, however. “The four days shorter time to clinical improvement in Covid patients receiving remdesivir reported by Dr Fauci from the NIAID trial is similar to the five days difference we saw in our trial in Chinese patients treated within 10 days of illness onset,” he said. “This suggests that this is a real effect and that remdesivir can help patients with Covid-19. We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19. Our trial and the NIAID trial are quite similar in design and a joint – analysis of the combined data will provide even greater certainty over the effectiveness of remdesivir. The next steps are to get the full data out and work on equitable access to remdesivir.” Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, pointed out that this was a randomised controlled trial, in which half the patients were given placebo, so the results were more reliable than in observational studies where all patients receive the drug. “These are promising preliminary results,” he said. “In normal times this drug would still be many months or years away from being approved for use on patients. But given these extraordinary circumstances, medicine regulators may decide to provide special fast approval in the near future, provided that there are ongoing controlled studies of its safety and efficacy.” A statement from the US regulator the Food and Drug Administration said that the agency has been talking with California-based Gilead “regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate”. Some clinicians are already giving the drug to their patients on so-called compassionate grounds. A separate set of results published by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday of a trial conducted in moderately ill patients in China concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition. Gilead said previously that those findings, released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week, were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.

From smashed crockery in ancient Syria to attacks on doctors in 1830s Britain, there are many documented examples of the despair and chaos experienced by those who lived through pandemics. Our journey through the ages looks at the spread of disease in three case studies, and then explores a historical view on how we think about pandemics today. Circa 541 to mid-eighth century The plague of Justinian ""People may have experienced traumatic shock"" The Justinianic plague began in 541 and returned periodically until the middle of the eighth century. It is estimated to have wiped out as many as tens of millions of people, although due to the limited evidence it is difficult to know the true scale. The disease was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, which is passed on by fleas and rodents. It is understood to have spread across central Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean. Recent genetic research into different strains of the bacterium that caused the plague has uncovered new evidence of it in sites across Britain, Germany, France and Spain. Recent DNA analysis shows the first pandemic spread more widely than previously thought Sites of genetic evidence Documented outbreaks 541–750 Sample found near Cambridge Illyricum Southern Gaul Greece Samples also found in Germany, France and Spain Sites of genetic evidence Documented outbreaks 541–750 Sample found near Cambridge Samples also found in Germany, France and Spain Asia Minor & Bithynia Illyricum Thrace Spain Southern Gaul Greece Mesopotamia Palestine North Africa Egypt Source: M Keller and colleagues, 2019 (PNAS). Inland borders reflect Roman provinces. Populations at the time are thought to have largely believed the plague was an act of God. Prof JN Hays, the author of Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impact on Human History, says people may have thought God had scourged regions and their atmospheres, and to counter this they tried to clear the air. He refers to an example of widespread breaking of pottery in Syria in the seventh century: “There was a deliberate smashing of pots; people making a clamour. This may be an illustration of a population experiencing traumatic shock. It might have been done in panic but also might have been done to somehow disturb and clear the atmosphere.” The plague of Justinian, which has been linked to the decline of the Roman empire, has been a renewed area of research in recent years. Credit: Alamy Mid-14th century The Black Death ""Foreign merchants were violently attacked"" The Black Death spread across Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa in the mid-14th century, wiping out somewhere between a third to half of the population. The pandemic was caused by the same lethal bacterium that caused the Justinianic plague. It was able to spread across trade routes, reaching Europe via the trading centre of Italy in 1347. Recent advances in DNA research have linked the Black Death to other branches of plague that circulated Eurasia around that time. Multiple waves of plague swept across Eurasia between the 1330s and 1360s Moscow Golden Horde Yuan Great State Chagatai Khanate Ilkhanatet Mecca Fengxiang Dai Viet Champa Genoa Venice Moscow Bolgar Golden Horde Yuan Great State Alexandria Beijing Chagatai Khanate Ilkhanate Mecca Fengxiang Tibet Canton Dai Viet Champa Guardian graphic. Source: Great State: China and the World, published by Profile Books in 2019. Contemporary understandings of the Black Death drew on ideas of sin and apocalypse, acts of God and alignments of the planets. Many people turned to prayer. Prof Adrian R Bell, a financial historian at Henley business school in Berkshire, says Catholic priests formed something of a frontline in Europe. “In the 14th century there was a big demand for priests. Everyone who was dying had to be given the last rites, which meant the death toll among priests was huge and it was likely they had to fast-track replacements.” There is also evidence that people tried to make sense of the devastation by scapegoating outsiders. In England there were violent attacks on Flemish merchants and weavers. As Bell explains: “There were riots against the Flemish as people tried to deal with the unexplainable. This also happened later during upheaval around the peasants' revolt, which came after decades of trauma from population loss and class conflict – people attacked outsiders for no reason other than that they were different.” An illustration from the 'Romance of Alexander' shows clothes infected by the Black Death being burnt in medieval Europe, circa 1340. Credit: Hulton Archive/Getty Images Early 19th century The second cholera pandemic ""People wanted the certainty of expert knowledge"" There were six cholera pandemics in the 19th century. Originating in India, the disease first reached Europe in 1831 during the second pandemic, via military and trade routes. In Britain, the disease was first recorded in Sunderland, from where it spread across the country, killing 32,000 during 1831-32. It remains a widespread and deadly disease today in places where people do not have access to sufficient sanitation and clean water. Cholera spread widely across Britain 1831-32 Cholera deaths in towns per 1,000 inhabitants 131 Duddingston The first case was recorded in Sunderland, October 1831 Cholera riots took place in Liverpool and other cities 80 Goole 100 50 100 50 131 Duddingston The first case was recorded in Sunderland, October 1831 Cholera riots took place in Liverpool and other cities 80 Goole 48 Bilston Source: Manuscript as to the incidence of cholera in Great Britain. Analysis by Dr Romola Davenport (Dept of Geography, Cambridge). Data for Ireland not available. Mortality from cholera was high and people died soon after being infected. Makeshift hospitals were set up in most major cities but there was resistance to this state intervention: riots broke out and doctors were attacked. People were suspicious of medics, who they had to pay for treatment, and afraid of their bodies being taken for dissection if they died.

Dr Katrina Navickas, a historian of 19th-century protest at the University of Hertfordshire, says corpse-related horror stories also added to a climate of fear. “People didn’t trust the doctors, they didn’t trust the government, and they were wound up by body snatching stories in the press. On top of this, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was a popular novel at the time, so there was a lot of gothic imagery around bodies and corpses.” A lack of knowledge about the disease may have exacerbated the frantic atmosphere. It was not established until later in the century that cholera was spread through water rather than air, and as a result it was unclear how the medical profession or state could cure it. “They weren’t sure how cholera spread, they were just really scared and that’s partly why there were riots. People wanted the certainty of expert knowledge but they just didn't have it then,” says Navickas. Can history help us understand the present? Some medical historians suggest that the study of earlier pandemics can enhance our insight into the context around infectious dieases in the 21st century. Monica H Green, a professor of medical history, says historical analysis of even the first plague pandemic can help our understanding of how disease moves today. “Bacterial pandemics are different to viral pandemics, but they still move to human populations. In terms of human activity and the way humans respond to threats and change, the study of ancient plagues can enrich our understanding.” In this final section, Dr Caitjan Gainty, a historian of 20th-century medicine and technology at King’s College London, provides a historical perspective on four pandemics of the past century, highlighting some points of comparison in terms of how we think – and talk – about disease. Our graphic below indicates the scale of deaths associated with these four selected pandemics, including the first four months of the coronavirus. COVID-19 deaths so far 20m – 50m recorded deaths 32m recorded deaths 18k recorded, 575k estimated 217k recorded deaths as of 9am 29 April 1918 - 1919 Spanish flu Between 20 million and 50 million people were recorded to have died during the Spanish flu, the most devastating influenza pandemic of the past century. For Gainty, one of the most striking comparisons is the public health response: “During the Spanish flu pandemic, they quarantined. They erected emergency hospitals. They had arguments about the usefulness of masks. Amid all of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in other areas of health, our public health response is largely unchanged. Our expectations about public health are remarkably different from other areas of healthcare.” 1981 - present day HIV/AIDS The HIV/Aids pandemic began in the early 1980s and has so far resulted in the deaths of more than 32 million people. Gainty suggests the ongoing HIV/Aids pandemic illustrates how political the designation of a pandemic can be. “HIV/Aids is not really on our pandemic radar. Initially, this invisibility was the result of the well-known prejudices that crept in very early on regarding who contracted – and how they contracted – HIV/Aids. Today it results from the fact that HIV/Aids follows pre-existing lines of inequality. In addition to acknowledging its victims as equal to those of any other pandemic, understanding HIV/Aids as a pandemic helps us confront our own health biases, something that the current coronavirus may or may not accomplish.” 2009 - 2010 Swine flu There were more than 18,500 lab-recorded deaths from swine flu during the pandemic, but statistical modelling suggests the true extent of deaths could have been as high as 570,000. It was not unusual for the rhetoric around swine flu to be closer to that of national security than healthcare. “The language of preparedness and national security brought into common use during the cold war applied nicely to infectious disease. In the post 9/11 context, this language moved from useful metaphor to actual policy, quite explicitly in the US, where natural disasters and epidemic disease were placed in the remit of the Department of Homeland Security. Swine flu, like coronavirus today, was not just like a threat to national security. It was an official adversary.” 2020 Coronavirus There have been 217k recorded deaths and more than 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus since January. Gainty says that in comparison with historical pandemics, one of the most striking things to emerge so far is how little states did to prepare for it, despite watching it develop in China for months: “In the past there wasn't the same kind or speed of communication about the movement of disease. It is not difficult to understand that in 1918 news about disease travelled more slowly and that responses were consequently slower. It’s harder to forgive unpreparedness, though, today. It begs the critical question: if it wasn’t more information that was needed to manage this crisis, what was it?” Spanish flu, WHO; HIV AIDS UNAIDS (2018), WHO (2018), Swine flu, WHO laboratory recorded deaths, upper range of CDC modelled data (2012); Coronavirus figures from Johns Hopkins University accurate as of 9am on the date of publication. Data for recorded deaths should be treated with caution as deaths associated with pandemics may be partially observed.

Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/Shutterstock Shopping is set to return – but not as we know it. Under new rules, shops will be asked to stash returned goods, or clothes that have been tried on, for up to 72 hours before another customer can handle them, while some stores have added they will also quarantine other items that have been handled by browsing shoppers – such as books. But how long does coronavirus last on different materials? Hard surfaces A much-discussed study published in the New England Medical Journal by researchers in the US looked at the survival of the coronavirus on a variety of surfaces – plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. The results reveal that while viable virus was still detected on plastic and stainless steel after 72 hours, for cardboard and copper it was no longer detectable after 24 hours and four hours respectively. For all surfaces, the quantity of virus dropped rapidly over time – in the case of plastic, the estimated median half-life of was around 6.8 hours on plastic. However, another study released this month – not yet peer-reviewed – by researchers in Bejing reported: “Sars-CoV-2 was stable on plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical mask, and remained viable for seven days on these seven surfaces.” William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said, in the case of copper, the US study likely overestimates the time the virus would survive. “I have spent 20 years looking at superbug bacteria, and then flu, noravirus, and coronavirus 229E [which is a cause of common colds] and they are all killed in minutes,” he said. The reason, he said, is that copper ions destroy the genetic material of bacteria and viruses. No changing rooms: what to expect when non-essential UK shops reopen Read more Clothes and shoes The US team did not look at all materials, and fabric was not studied. “People are extrapolating from the cardboard experiments [by the US team],” said Keevil. “So they say ah, absorbent surface, less than 24 hours, so we assume fabrics are the same – but that is a big assumption.” A recent study into the coronavirus behind Covid-19 by researchers in Hong Kong suggested no infectious virus could be detected from cloth on the second day after virus was deposited. Meanwhile, the Beijing study reported: “No infectious virus could be recovered from cotton clothes after four days,” but added: “Rapid loss of infectivity was observed within one hour after incubation on both paper and cotton clothes surfaces.” But there are many considerations. Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at the University College London, told the Guardian Science Weekly podcast in March: “We have got to remember the virus, when it goes on to a surface, it is not just the virus, it is of course a virus within a droplet. So if for instance it is covered with proteinaceous material, from sputum that comes from cells in the lung from which the virus has been coughed up, then clearly that virus will last longer on the surface than if it is without that.” In the case of shoes, said Keevil, the situation is also unclear. “Shoes have some kind of a finish to them, like a polish – so no one knows,” he said. “You might argue that if, say, shoes have got a polish on them, does it act anyway like soap? And if the answer is yes, the virus might die quickly on these.” How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces? Read more But, even then, that would only apply to the outside of the shoe. Books “If you think of a book, it has got two types of surface, it has got the outer glossy surface and then the inner paper,” said Keevil. “The outer glossy [surface], you could consider that to be like a hard surface, so that could be three days.” In the case of paper, said Keevil, studies into the Sars virus – which the US study suggests has similar survival times to the virus behind Covid-19 – have offered a range of possible survival times ranging from three hours to five days. A similar range was seen from the Hong Kong and Beijing studies for the coronavirus behind Covid-19. The wide range of survival times, Keevil adds, is down to factors including, in the case of the Sars work, people using different strains of the same virus (at least for the Sars work) and differences in the way researchers explore if a virus is viable. He cautioned that in some cases researchers may extract the virus from materials, such as fabric and paper, that is trapped within layers, “arguably meaning it is not released to the hand during contact when people report just hours survival”. If viable virus is still present on surfaces, what does this mean for infection? Keevil said the matter is a big question. “At the moment everyone is referring back to things like flu,” he said, adding that virus is known to be spread by people touching their face – a reason why handwashing has been highlighted as crucial in tackling coronavirus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It may be possible that a person can get Covid-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” Topics Coronavirus outbreak Shops and shopping explainers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Chancellor takes a softly-softly approach to easing Covid-19 crisis support Larry Elliott Rishi Sunak’s choice speaks volumes about his view of Britain’s likely pace of recovery Published: 29 May 2020 Published: 29 May 2020 Chancellor takes a softly-softly approach to easing Covid-19 crisis support Covid-19 transmission rate stable for third week, says ONS Snapshot infection survey suggests about 133,000 people infected in England in last two weeks Published: 28 May 2020 Covid-19 transmission rate stable for third week, says ONS Easing the lockdown: how will we know if infections bounce back?

Yes. Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk. interactive The evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests that face masks can contribute to reducing transmission of Covid-19. Analysis by the Royal Society said this included homemade cloth face masks. Are paper surgical single-use masks better or is a cloth mask OK? The evidence on any mask use, outside of surgical masks, is still emerging: there appears to be some benefit, but the exact parameters of which masks are the best and the extent to which they protect the wearer or those around them are still being figured out. A tighter fitting around the face is probably better, but the CDC suggests any covering, including a bandana, is better than none. One US study investigated which household materials best removed particles of 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter, the typical size of viruses and bacteria, and concluded that good options include vacuum cleaner bags, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton” or multiple layers of material. Scarves and bandana material were less effective, but still captured a fraction of particles. interactive How do you take them on and off safely? Before putting on a mask, clean your hands well with soap and water. Cover the mouth and nose with your mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while using it and, if you do, wash your hands. Replace the mask when it is damp. To remove your mask, take it off using the elastic tags, without touching the front and discard immediately into a closed bin or, if the mask is reusable, directly into the washing machine. How often do you need to wash masks? They should be washed after each use. The US Center for Disease Control suggests “routinely”. interactive Is there an environmental concern? Many commercially available masks are made from layers of plastics and are designed to be single-use. According to an analysis by scientists at University College London, if every person in the UK used one single-use mask each day for a year, an extra 66,000 tonnes of contaminated plastic waste would be created. The use of reusable masks by the general population would significantly reduce plastic waste and the climate change impact of any policy requirements for the wearing of face masks, according to the UCL team, led by Prof Mark Miodownik. They say that according to the best evidence, reusable masks perform most of the tasks of single-use masks without the associated waste stream. • This article was amended on 12 May 2020 to clarify that N95 masks alone do not guarantee protection from Covid-19 infection.

Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/Shutterstock Shopping is set to return – but not as we know it. Under new rules, shops will be asked to stash returned goods, or clothes that have been tried on, for up to 72 hours before another customer can handle them, while some stores have added they will also quarantine other items that have been handled by browsing shoppers – such as books. But how long does coronavirus last on different materials? Hard surfaces A much-discussed study published in the New England Medical Journal by researchers in the US looked at the survival of the coronavirus on a variety of surfaces – plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. The results reveal that while viable virus was still detected on plastic and stainless steel after 72 hours, for cardboard and copper it was no longer detectable after 24 hours and four hours respectively. For all surfaces, the quantity of virus dropped rapidly over time – in the case of plastic, the estimated median half-life of was around 6.8 hours on plastic. However, another study released this month – not yet peer-reviewed – by researchers in Bejing reported: “Sars-CoV-2 was stable on plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical mask, and remained viable for seven days on these seven surfaces.” William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said, in the case of copper, the US study likely overestimates the time the virus would survive. “I have spent 20 years looking at superbug bacteria, and then flu, noravirus, and coronavirus 229E [which is a cause of common colds] and they are all killed in minutes,” he said. The reason, he said, is that copper ions destroy the genetic material of bacteria and viruses. No changing rooms: what to expect when non-essential UK shops reopen Read more Clothes and shoes The US team did not look at all materials, and fabric was not studied. “People are extrapolating from the cardboard experiments [by the US team],” said Keevil. “So they say ah, absorbent surface, less than 24 hours, so we assume fabrics are the same – but that is a big assumption.” A recent study into the coronavirus behind Covid-19 by researchers in Hong Kong suggested no infectious virus could be detected from cloth on the second day after virus was deposited. Meanwhile, the Beijing study reported: “No infectious virus could be recovered from cotton clothes after four days,” but added: “Rapid loss of infectivity was observed within one hour after incubation on both paper and cotton clothes surfaces.” But there are many considerations. Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at the University College London, told the Guardian Science Weekly podcast in March: “We have got to remember the virus, when it goes on to a surface, it is not just the virus, it is of course a virus within a droplet. So if for instance it is covered with proteinaceous material, from sputum that comes from cells in the lung from which the virus has been coughed up, then clearly that virus will last longer on the surface than if it is without that.” In the case of shoes, said Keevil, the situation is also unclear. “Shoes have some kind of a finish to them, like a polish – so no one knows,” he said. “You might argue that if, say, shoes have got a polish on them, does it act anyway like soap? And if the answer is yes, the virus might die quickly on these.” How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces? Read more But, even then, that would only apply to the outside of the shoe. Books “If you think of a book, it has got two types of surface, it has got the outer glossy surface and then the inner paper,” said Keevil. “The outer glossy [surface], you could consider that to be like a hard surface, so that could be three days.” In the case of paper, said Keevil, studies into the Sars virus – which the US study suggests has similar survival times to the virus behind Covid-19 – have offered a range of possible survival times ranging from three hours to five days. A similar range was seen from the Hong Kong and Beijing studies for the coronavirus behind Covid-19. The wide range of survival times, Keevil adds, is down to factors including, in the case of the Sars work, people using different strains of the same virus (at least for the Sars work) and differences in the way researchers explore if a virus is viable. He cautioned that in some cases researchers may extract the virus from materials, such as fabric and paper, that is trapped within layers, “arguably meaning it is not released to the hand during contact when people report just hours survival”. If viable virus is still present on surfaces, what does this mean for infection? Keevil said the matter is a big question. “At the moment everyone is referring back to things like flu,” he said, adding that virus is known to be spread by people touching their face – a reason why handwashing has been highlighted as crucial in tackling coronavirus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It may be possible that a person can get Covid-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” Topics Coronavirus outbreak Shops and shopping explainers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Chancellor takes a softly-softly approach to easing Covid-19 crisis support Larry Elliott Rishi Sunak’s choice speaks volumes about his view of Britain’s likely pace of recovery Published: 29 May 2020 Published: 29 May 2020 Chancellor takes a softly-softly approach to easing Covid-19 crisis support Covid-19 transmission rate stable for third week, says ONS Snapshot infection survey suggests about 133,000 people infected in England in last two weeks Published: 28 May 2020 Covid-19 transmission rate stable for third week, says ONS Easing the lockdown: how will we know if infections bounce back?

The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected underreporting. Official Brazilian death toll exceeds 30,000 A record record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in a 24-hour period in Brazil, taking the country’s total death toll to 31,199. But the president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to downplay the pandemic, even as Brazil’s health ministry says the number of cases has risen to 555,383; second only to the United States. WHO reports 100,000 new cases a day for five days The World Health Organization said it has received reports of 100,000 new cases every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said the WHO has resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing data in studies that apparently showed it was dangerous. Pakistan records largest single day rise in new infections Pakistan has recorded its largest single day increase in infections on Wednesday, as a fourth politician died after testing positive for the virus. Mian Jamshed Kakakhel, who was a member of a provincial assembly in the north-west, died on Wednesday. His death comes a day after two lawmakers died at different hospitals after testing positive. Sweden passes France for Covid-19 deaths per capita The number of deaths per capita in Sweden has surpassed that of France, as the country also records a major increase in infections due to the release of previously withheld statistics from a Stockholm test lab. With 450 deaths per 1 million people, Sweden now has the seventh-worst death rate in the world, according to tallies kept on the Worldometers website. Austria ends land border checks, except for Italy Entry checks at land borders to Austria introduced because of the pandemic will be scrapped from Thursday, except for those at the border with Italy, Austria’s foreign minister has announced. The controls on the Italian border will be evaluated again next week, Alexander Schallenberg told a press conference. UK government criticised for failing to release test and trace data The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed frustration that data on the UK’s test and trace system, which is designed to keep in check a second peak, is not being made available by the government. “I hope you understand that our frustration is that it is very hard to scrutinise what the government is doing if we’re not given the data that allows us to do that,” he told the programme’s chief, Dido Harding, as she gives evidence to the Commons health committee, which Hunt chairs. Germany warns against trips to UK Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to the UK while it maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government will scrap general travel warnings for 30 countries, including the UK, from 15 June. They will be replaced with daily travel advice for each country that reflects the current development of the pandemic.

Photograph: Reuters Over the weekend, there were no new deaths from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however, some scientists are warning of a second wave of infections – an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall in the number of cases. These warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people when it returned the following winter in a deadlier form after the first outbreak had been controlled. But there’s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we’ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases. Although the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next. One hypothesis, floated by doctors in Italy, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads. Through viral mutation, Sars-Cov-2 could lose its potency and become milder or less infectious. But coronaviruses have proven a remarkably stable type of virus. There is no evidence to support this kind of mutation occurring in a matter of years, let alone weeks. Rather than viral mutations, improvements in survival rates in Italy are probably related to better clinical management of Covid-19, as doctors learn how to treat patients in hospital more effectively. Another view is that the number of people susceptible to this virus is smaller than estimated, either because a large section of the population has already been exposed to it, or because they’ve developed cross-immunity from other similar viruses. This scenario also seems unlikely. Early serology tests estimated that only 17% of Londoners and 5% of the UK population had been exposed to the virus in late May. This means that there is still a large percentage of the population who have not yet had the chance to build immunity, a picture that corresponds with serology studies from France, Spain and Sweden, which had similar results. But the picture might be more complex. A recent study reported that individuals who had never been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 still had T-cells reacting to the virus, another key component of the body’s immune response. The authors of the study suggested that having previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses could mean the body is able to detect the proteins in the Sars-Cov-2 virus. While this finding could be promising, there is still no evidence that either antibodies or T-cell reactivity would result in someone developing immunity to Sars-Cov-2. A third approach, which has been deliberately adopted in Sweden, is to let the virus run its course and spread through the population. This treats Covid-19 much like the influenza virus; until a vaccine becomes available or enough of the population is exposed that herd immunity develops, the virus will be unstoppable. But the cost of allowing the virus to spread through the population until it develops herd immunity is that many people will become ill or die as a result of catching Covid-19. And with no confirmation on how long immunity would even last, this approach offers no certainty about whether people could become reinfected after a couple of months or years – leading to a second wave of infections. My own view is that we can avoid a second wave if governments aggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it’s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination. Think of this as a series of constantly emerging small fires that need to be extinguished quickly before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. South Korea and Germany have effectively run with this approach, rolling out mass testing and tracing strategies, isolating carriers of the virus and implementing monitoring systems to map its spread. But the focus on deaths from a second wave may miss the real toll of the virus: the long-term damage it can cause to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and even blood vessels among those who recover. This is emerging as one of the horrors of Covid-19. It is often forgotten that Covid-19 is a new virus, completely different to the flu, and that it might have longer-term health impacts that will only be identified in months or years. If coronavirus is our generation’s polio, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific. New Zealand has eliminated coronavirus, and Australia is inching closer to this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and people can safely see relatives. The successes of New Zealand and Australia might force other countries to rethink their own strategies, and the feasibility of eliminating the virus within their borders. Instead of living with a constant threat of Covid-19, people might start asking their own governments – why not try to get rid of it altogether? • Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Topics Coronavirus outbreak Opinion Infectious diseases Medical research comment Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular The Guardian view Columnists Letters Opinion videos Cartoons News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Discount Codes Support The Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top © 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Your questions answered on what type of mask to wear to cut the risk of getting Covid-19 Coronavirus – latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Hannah Devlin Science correspondent @hannahdev Fri 19 Jun 2020 04.49 EDT Last modified on Fri 19 Jun 2020 04.58 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email A woman putting on a disposable face mask. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian Does it matter what sort of mask you wear? Yes. Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk. Interactive The evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests that face masks can contribute to reducing transmission of Covid-19. Analysis by the Royal Society said this included homemade cloth face masks. Are paper surgical single-use masks better or is a cloth mask OK? The evidence on any mask use, outside of surgical masks, is still emerging: there appears to be some benefit, but the exact parameters of which masks are the best and the extent to which they protect the wearer or those around them are still being figured out. A tighter fitting around the face is probably better, but the CDC suggests any covering, including a bandana, is better than none. One US study investigated which household materials best removed particles of 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter, the typical size of viruses and bacteria, and concluded that good options include vacuum cleaner bags, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton” or multiple layers of material. Scarves and bandana material were less effective, but still captured a fraction of particles. Interactive How do you take them on and off safely? Before putting on a mask, clean your hands well with soap and water. Cover the mouth and nose with your mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while using it and, if you do, wash your hands. Replace the mask when it is damp. To remove your mask, take it off using the elastic tags, without touching the front and discard immediately into a closed bin or, if the mask is reusable, directly into the washing machine. How often do you need to wash masks? They should be washed after each use. The US Centers for Disease Control suggests “routinely”. Interactive Is there an environmental concern? Many commercially available masks are made from layers of plastics and are designed to be single-use. According to an analysis by scientists at University College London, if every person in the UK used one single-use mask each day for a year, an extra 66,000 tonnes of contaminated plastic waste would be created. The use of reusable masks by the general population would significantly reduce plastic waste and the climate change impact of any policy requirements for the wearing of face masks, according to the UCL team, led by Prof Mark Miodownik. They say that according to the best evidence, reusable masks perform most of the tasks of single-use masks without the associated waste stream.

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA The draconian coronavirus lockdowns across the world have led to sharp drops in carbon emissions, but this will have “negligible” impact on the climate crisis, with global heating cut by just 0.01C by 2030, a study has found. But the analysis also shows that putting the huge sums of post-Covid-19 government funding into a green recovery and shunning fossil fuels will give the world a good chance of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5C. The scientists said we are now at a “make or break” moment in keeping under the limit – as compared with pre-industrial levels – agreed by the world’s governments to avoid the worst effects of global heating. The research is primarily based on newly available Google and Apple mobility data. This gives near-real-time information on travel and work patterns and therefore gives an idea of the level of emissions. The data covered 123 countries that together are responsible for 99% of fossil fuel emissions. The researchers found that global CO2 emissions dropped by more than 25% in April 2020, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 30%. Q&A Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? Show Hide China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. These falls show that rapid changes in people’s behaviour can make big differences to emissions in the short term, but the scientists said such lockdowns are impossible to maintain. Therefore, economy-wide changes are needed for a transformation to a zero-emissions economy, such as greening transport, buildings and industry with renewable energy, hydrogen or by capturing and burying CO2. “The direct effect of the pandemic-driven [lockdown] will be negligible,” said the researchers, whose analysis was led by Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds. “In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3C by 2050.” The global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1C above the long-term average and even with current emissions-cutting pledges a further rise of 0.6C is expected by 2050. “It is now make or break for the 1.5C target,” said Forster. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to really change the direction of society. We do not have to go back to where we were, because times of crisis are also the time to change.” Lockdowns trigger dramatic fall in global carbon emissions Read more Prof Keith Shine, at the University of Reading and not part of the study team, said: “It is deeply impressive to get such a near-real-time analysis of the climate impact [of the lockdowns].” Shine said a green recovery from the pandemic is essential to meet the Paris climate agreement target: “The study shows that, because CO2 is so persistent in the atmosphere, short-term emission reductions resulting directly from the pandemic lockdowns lead to undetectable reductions in warming. It is only via sustained and radical changes in the way we use fossil fuels that we can hope to meet the Paris [climate agreement] target.” The analysis, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used mobility data from Google and Apple that tracks the location of individuals. This was used to assess changes in levels of transport and office and factory working, and then the emissions of 10 different greenhouse gases and air pollutants. These estimates matched the measurements available for some gases, such as nitrogen oxides, pollutants mostly emitted by diesel vehicles. The team assumed that significant restrictions on activity caused by Covid-19 remained in place until the end of 2021. However, using computer models, the team showed this would only produce a tiny reduction in long-term global heating. The scientists also examined recovery scenarios. If the recovery mirrors the investments made after the 2008 financial crisis – which included major support for fossil fuels – the global temperature will rise by more than 1.5C by 2050, which scientists say will cause widespread damage across the world. However, a strong green recovery that invests 1.2% of global GDP in low-carbon technologies – more than $1tn (£760bn) – and does not support bailouts for fossil fuel companies is likely to cut warming by 0.3C, the scientists found. Forster said the recovery investments being made today are backing both green technologies and fossil fuels. “It is still going both ways. But every bit of warming is important to try to avoid, so if we don’t keep the rise to 1.5C, it is still worth getting to zero carbon as fast as possible.” Dr Jaise Kuriakose, at the University of Manchester and not involved in the study, said people’s activities had changed in previously unthinkable ways, with a stop to flying and a shift to virtual meetings. “These suggest there is a public willingness for behavioural changes to a more sustainable and low-carbon lifestyle,” he said. “[But] to take advantage of this, structural changes and new policies are essential. Without a green recovery, it is even challenging to meet the UK government’s legislated net-zero target by 2050, let alone the ambitious Paris agreement.” Topics Climate change Climate countdown Coronavirus outbreak Greenhouse gas emissions Global economy Paris climate agreement news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular Environment Climate change Wildlife Energy Pollution News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Discount Codes Support The Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top © 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Think like a Norwegian Self and wellbeing Psychology Dreading a dark winter lockdown? Think like a Norwegian Studies show people living in the Arctic Circle are armed with a mindset that helps combat the long ‘polar night’. It might come in handy for us all… David Robson Sat 26 Sep 2020 12.00 EDT Last modified on Mon 28 Sep 2020 09.24 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Stunning views in Hordaland, Norway Photograph: Alexey Karamanov/Getty Images/Tetra images RF When Kari Leibowitz first arrived in the Norwegian city of Tromsø, she was both intrigued by, and fearful of, the approaching winter. Two hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, the city does not see the sun from mid-November to mid-January. It was a far cry from the state of New Jersey, where she had grown up, or Stanford, California, where she had been studying before travelling to Norway. As a health psychologist, Leibowitz’s aim was to understand the ways that Tromsø’s citizens coped with the long “polar night”. In many countries, the short days of winter are thought to cause lethargy and low mood, resulting in “seasonal affective disorder” (SAD). This is sometimes assumed to have a purely biological basis – levels of mood-regulating neurotransmitters such as serotonin are generally lower in winter than in summer, and last week a study suggested that people with more neurotic personalities are particularly susceptible to low winter moods. SAD is often treated using standard antidepressant drugs, as well as psychotherapies. During the darkest periods of the polar night, Tromsø only receives two to three hours of indirect sunlight, shining into the sky from below the horizon. Yet its inhabitants do not show the kind of wintertime depression you might expect of a city cast in darkness. One study by May Trude Johnsen at the University of Tromsø found that the citizens’ wellbeing barely changed across the year. Their sleep was a bit more disturbed without the daily rhythm of the rising and setting sun, but they reported no increase in mental distress during the winter. So what’s their secret? Of the many potential explanations, Leibowitz’s work suggests that one vital component may be a particular “mindset” that arms the citizens against the stresses of the long polar night. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tromso at night. Photograph: RelaxFoto.de/Getty Images These lessons could not be more timely. We may not live in the far north, but many of us in Europe and the US find winter to be the cruellest of all seasons – and that’s without the shadow of a global pandemic. Last week the Observer reported that as we face the daunting prospect of a second lockdown in cold dark conditions Brits have been stocking up on patio heaters and fire pits but, consumerism aside, what might we learn from the Norwegians’ psychological resilience? Leibowitz’s findings build on decades of previous research showing that the mental framing of stressful events can powerfully influence the ways we are affected by them. People who see stressful events as “challenges”, with an opportunity to learn and adapt, tend to cope much better than those who focus more on the threatening aspects – like the possibility of failure, embarrassment or illness. These differences in mindset not only influence people’s mood, but also their physiological responses, such as changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and how quickly they recover after the event. And the impact can be long-lasting, even during major transitions: one Israeli study found that immigrants’ stress appraisals can predict how well they adjust to their new country. They also seem to determine how well police officers in Australia cope with the stresses of their work. Needless to say, our appraisal of whether an event feels like a threat, or an opportunity, will depend on our circumstances and our resources to handle the problems we encounter. But it is sometimes possible to change our appraisal of a situation consciously. In one memorable experiment, Alison Wood Brooks, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, asked participants to face their fears of public speaking. Brooks found that simply asking the participants to repeat the phrase “I am excited” helped to reduce their anxious feelings and led to a better overall performance, since it encouraged them to view the situation as a new challenge rather than a threat. Many psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy, have also been found to increase our resilience by helping us to reframe stressful events in more constructive ways. To test whether a difference in outlook could also explain the resilience of Tromsø’s residents, Leibowitz designed the “wintertime mindset scale”, which asked participants to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with statements such as There are many things to enjoy about the winter I love the cosiness of the winter months Winter brings many wonderful seasonal changes And Winter is boring Winter is a limiting time of year There are many things to dislike about winter Sure enough, she found that participants’ answers predicted their wellbeing over the coming months; the more they saw the winter as an exciting opportunity to enjoy a glacial climate, the better they fared, with high levels of life satisfaction and overall mental health. Amazingly, Leibowitz found that these attitudes actually increase with latitude, in the regions where the winters will be even harsher. People in Svalbard (at 78 deg north) had a more positive mindset than the people in Tromsø (69 deg north), who took a more optimistic view than people in Oslo (60 deg north). In other words, the positive wintertime mindset is most common where it’s most needed. Most people don’t realise their beliefs about winter are subjective. They feel there’s nothing they can do about it Kari Leibowitz These positive attitudes were apparent in Leibowitz’s casual conversations; indeed, she says that many of her friends struggled to understand why you would not enjoy winter. They embraced the possibility of skiing or hiking in the mountains, and savoured the chance to practice koselig – a Norwegian version of Denmark’s hygge – which might involve snuggling under blankets with a warm drink in the candlelight. Far from dwindling in the dark, Tromsø’s community flourished in the long polar night. “There is this interaction between the culture that you’re part of, and the mentality or mindset that grows out of it,” says Prof Joar Vittersø, Leibowitz’s collaborator at the Arctic University of Tromsø. Surrounded by Norwegian positivity, Leibowitz soon found her own mindset shifting; she learned to love long walks with a headlamp to guide her path. And rather than yearning for sunlight, she came to appreciate the “soft, peaceful” appearance of the city in the darkness. “When it was snowing, I would always try to go out and enjoy the fresh snowfall.” She suspects that many other people could follow suit, once they find out about this research. “Most people don’t realise that their beliefs about winter are subjective,” says Leibowitz, whose research is currently under peer review. “They feel like they’re just someone who hates the winter and there’s nothing they can do about it… But once you put it in people’s heads that mindsets exist, and that you have control over your mindset – I think that that’s tremendously powerful.” Fjord focus: is Norway's friluftsliv the answer to surviving a second lockdown? Read more Leibowitz conducted her initial studies long before the new coronavirus left Wuhan – and she is realistic about the challenges of trying to see the positive in the pandemic. “A change in mindset is not a cure-all for everything,” she emphasises. It can’t simply eliminate our anxieties about the job insecurity or the fear of losing a loved one, and we should not attempt to suppress those emotions. Even so, she suspects that adopting the positive wintertime mindset could make a second lockdown a little less daunting for those who worry about keeping their mood buoyed in the bad weather. We might recognise, for instance, that it’s a time for baking comfort food or cosy evenings curled up under a blanket in front of a box set – practising a little bit of the Norwegian koselig. And if we normally exercise on a running machine, we might try to find value in a bracing jog in the elements. Since the risk of contagion is much lower outside, we might also adapt to the Scandinavian way of outdoor socialising (lockdown regulations permitting). Tromsø, for example, has an open-air cinema, so residents can enjoy atmospheric film screenings in the eerie Arctic darkness. As the Norwegians say: “There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes.” This time, we do at least have the advantage of knowing what did and didn’t work during the first lockdown, so we can be more realistic in our expectations of what we can and can’t achieve, focusing our efforts on the small actions that bring the most comfort, rather than aiming to write a bestselling novel, say. A recent study by Prof Hannes Zacher, a psychologist at Leipzig University, shows that our personal framing of the pandemic has already had a small but significant effect on our responses during the crisis so far. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The more people saw the winter as an exciting opportunity, the better their wellbeing.’ Photograph: DieterMeyrl/Getty Images The survey, which was set up before the crisis, ran from December 2019 to May this year – and as you might expect, there was a significant drop in life satisfaction and positive mood after the pandemic hit Europe. But certain psychological characteristics and coping strategies seemed to protect some people from the worst effects. This included “active coping” – such as setting up a proper office at home, scheduling home-schooling times for the children, and making sure to eat well, sleep well, and exercise, Zacher says. As the previous research predicted, the most resilient participants also managed to recognise the potential opportunities in the crisis – such as “learning something from the experience, or trying to grow as a person as a result from the experience,” Zacher explains. Like Leibowitz, Zacher emphasises that the aim is not to sugar-coat the situation or to deny the difficulties that we will face; we can’t hide from the shadow cast by the pandemic, any more than the citizens of Tromsø can pretend that the sun is still rising. By recognising our own capacity to control our responses to the lockdown and the changing seasons, however, we may all find some hidden reserves of strength and resilience to see us through the days ahead. • David Robson is a science writer and author of The Intelligence Trap: Revolutionise Your Thinking and Make Wiser Decisions (Hodder & Stoughton £9.99).

Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters The long read Inside the airline industry's meltdown Passenger planes grounded in Birmingham, Alabama, in March. Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Coronavirus has hit few sectors harder than air travel, wiping out tens of thousands of jobs and uncountable billions in revenue. While most fleets were grounded, the industry was forced to reimagine its future by Samanth Subramanian Tue 29 Sep 2020 01.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 30 Sep 2020 05.09 EDT When an airline no longer wants a plane, it is sent away to a boneyard, a storage facility where it sits outdoors on a paved lot, wingtip to wingtip with other unwanted planes. From the air, the planes look like the bleached remains of some long-forgotten skeleton. Europe’s biggest boneyard is built on the site of a late-30s airfield in Teruel, in eastern Spain, where the dry climate is kind to metallic airframes. Many planes are here for short-term storage, biding their time while they change owners or undergo maintenance. If their future is less clear, they enter long-term storage. Sometimes a plane’s limbo ends when it is taken apart, its body rendered efficiently down into spare parts and recycled metal. In February, Patrick Lecer, the CEO of Tarmac Aerosave, the company that owns the Teruel boneyard and three others in France, had one eye cocked towards China. Lecer has been in aviation long enough to remember flights being grounded during the Sars epidemic in 2003. This year, when the coronavirus spread beyond Asia, he knew what was coming. “We started making space in our sites, playing Tetris with the aircraft to free up two or three or four more spaces in each,” he told me. By late March, after the US shut its skies to Europe, planes began streaming into Tarmac Aerosave’s boneyards. No one knew if they were going into short-term residency or long-term storage. On one day alone, 3 April, the Teruel boneyard received five Boeing 747s and two Boeing 777s. Throughout the next few weeks, planes arrived from Lufthansa, Air France, Etihad and British Airways. Before the pandemic, there were 78 aircraft at Teruel. By June, there were 114, running near the full capacity of 120-130. Patrick Lecer’s other three boneyards were also “close to saturation”, he told me in July. He sounded grave. He had just spent two hours on the phone with an airline that wanted him to house another 30 planes. “I’ve been in this business almost 40 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this. The mood is bad. It feels like a tragedy.” Among all the industries hit by Covid-19, aviation suffered in two distinct ways. Most obviously, there was the fear of contagion. No other business depends on putting you into knee-by-thigh proximity with strangers for hours, while whisking potentially diseased humans from one continent to another. Less directly, there was the tumbling economy. It is an axiom in aviation that air travel correlates to GDP. When people have more money, they fly more. But in the midst of this historic downturn, no one was buying plane tickets. In the past, airlines have only been stung by one or the other of these factors. During Sars, travel was unsafe, but the global economy didn’t flatline. During the 2008 financial crash, money was tight, but flying was not a health risk. In the 110 years since the dawn of commercial flight, these blows had never been dealt in tandem, until this year. Planes grounded by coronavirus pandemic sit idle at airports around the world – in pictures Read more To customers, investors and airlines, an earthbound existence was unimaginable before the coronavirus. For commercial aviation, the past two decades have been a period of superheated growth. In 1998, airlines sold 1.46bn tickets for one kind of flight or another. By 2019, that number had shot up to 4.54bn. This year has undone it all. Early in March, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) published two potential scenarios. The more extreme one forecast a global loss of revenue of $113bn. By mid-April, about 14,400 passenger planes around the world – 65% of the global fleet – had been placed into storage, according to the aviation research firm Cirium. Companies that have been brought to the brink, or in some cases collapsed entirely, include Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic, Flybe in the UK, South African Airways, LATAM and Avianca in South America, Compass and Trans States in the US. Airlines for America, a trade group, calculated that the last time the US averaged fewer than 100,000 daily passengers was in 1954. Emirates became so desperate for passengers that it promised to shell out $1,765 for a funeral if anyone died of Covid-19 after flying with them. By June, Iata had to issue a revision: Revenues will fall by $419bn this year, precisely half of what airlines earned in 2019. These numbers are scarcely credible, even to industry veterans. Boet Kreiken, the executive vice-president for customer experience at the Dutch carrier KLM, recalled a meeting early in the pandemic, in KLM’s offices near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. His colleagues had brought in the latest figures for new bookings and the dismal projections for the summer ahead. “I’ve seen some crises in my time – the Iraq war, 9/11, Sars, the Icelandic volcano eruption,” Kreiken said. “I know in the gut what that feels like. But this was something else. I was staring at the chart and got so involved in thinking about the consequences that the others had to tell me twice: ‘Boet, start the meeting!’” JFK airport in New York in April. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Prior to the pandemic, airlines had been wrestling with a different motivation against flying. Aviation accounts for 12% of all carbon dioxide emissions from transport, and flying is so cheap and easy that we can add unthinkingly to that gush of carbon in the seconds it takes to book a ticket on an app. London to New York and back creates 1,972kg of carbon dioxide – more than the average person in Madagascar or Colombia generates in a year. Last year, KLM unveiled an initiative that sounded like a plea for less business. “Do you always need to meet face to face? Could you take the train instead?” a voiceover in an advert asked. “We all have to fly every now and then. But next time, think about flying responsibly.” (“There was a little bit of bravery in that,” a KLM executive told me. “It had to be pitched to the board three times before they approved it.”) The ad, bold as it was, also fit a broader pattern. As ever, individuals are being requested to tame their habits of consumption, even while governments and large corporations do far less than they might to curb their expenditure of carbon. At the same time, we’re assured by airline companies that our self-restraint has to be only temporary, and that some technological salvation – a plane running on batteries or hydrogen – will let us return to our habits very soon. This year, as the industry’s fortunes tumbled, and as executives attempted to run their airlines even while most of their planes stayed on the ground, a different kind of technological salvationalism emerged. The future of flight now appears to be pinned on the discovery of a successful Covid-19 vaccine. The important problem of how much we ought to be flying gave way to the even more basic uncertainty of when and in what fashion we will ever fly regularly again at all. KLM calls itself the world’s oldest commercial airline, by which it means it’s the oldest airline still operating under its original name. Last October, KLM turned 100, and Pieter Elbers, its CEO, was feeling cheerful. Elbers joined the airline in 1992, when he was 22, and worked all over the world before reaching the top in 2014. He told me that KLM’s profit margin for that year was a slender 2%. “From that, we moved to 8% last year, so there was a really positive, upbeat atmosphere.” By December 2019, he’d flown to so many KLM offices around the world to celebrate the centenary that he decided to spend New Year’s Eve at home in Amsterdam. A couple of weeks later, when KLM’s partner airlines in China began suspending operations, Elbers heard the first murmurs about a strange new virus. Figuring that China would soon contain the disease, Elbers and his team cut down the frequency of KLM’s flights to China, reallocating those planes to US routes instead. By February, though, the pandemic had spread to Europe; by March, the Netherlands had locked down. At the KLM offices, only Elbers and half a dozen executives continued to come in to work, to wrestle with the crisis. Elbers left home at 6.30am every day and drove half an hour on vacant roads. “Everyone sat in my office, since it’s spacious enough to still be able to keep a good distance from each other.” Sometimes he would wander over to Schiphol and gaze at the slumbering planes and the desolate terminal. The airline industry’s metabolism is ordinarily slow – planes ordered years in advance, routes plotted and pilots trained with measured care. During the pandemic, though, decisions had to be made with uncommon speed. Late in March, for instance, a KLM flight somewhere above Novosibirsk, bearing towards Shanghai, was told that every incoming flight crew now had to quarantine for 14 days in a Chinese state hospital. This rule was so new that it hadn’t existed when the plane left Amsterdam; circumstances had changed mid flight. Executives scrambled to get an approved exemption from Dutch and Chinese authorities so that the crew could stay aboard the plane in Shanghai and bring it home 18 hours later. KLM planes grounded at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, March 2020. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock The same month, Elbers retired three Boeing 747s – huge, fuel-guzzling craft that were on the verge of being put out to pasture anyway. Mere weeks later, they had to be hastily pulled out of storage and pressed into service to ferry medical equipment and PPE from China to the Netherlands. There were complicated repatriation flights to be flown. Two thousand Dutch travellers had to be retrieved from Australia. The first repatriation flight to Sydney had to leave with 48 hours’ notice, but it had been 20 years since KLM had flown there – so long that the routes and permits had to be plotted afresh and reloaded into flight computers. Usually, airline representatives convene at “slot conferences” twice a year, to divvy up landing and takeoff slots in airports around the world for the season ahead, said Vincent van Hooff, who oversees KLM’s flight operations. “We are not in the ad-hoc business. But now it was a totally new game. Would we still be flying to London tomorrow? Would we need more slots for repatriation flights? It was almost as if we had suddenly become a charter company.” Amid this mayhem, the pandemic’s effects upon aviation seemed sudden and tectonic. Richard Aboulafia has an alternate view: “Nothing new is happening. It’s just happening faster.” Aboulafia is the vice-president of analysis at Teal Group, an aviation market research firm, and every month he sends out a chatty newsletter that is widely read in the industry. “Dear Fellow Dark Cloud Dwellers,” he wrote in May, peering ahead at the contours of a post-Covid industry. Airlines will hoard cash, he predicted. They will choose smaller, more efficient planes. They will fly more point-to-point routes, leaving behind the old hub-and-spoke networks – the kind that require us to fly from one town to another in a minimum of two legs, via a “hub” airport in a major metropolis. But these changes were under way even last year, he argued. The coronavirus has only made them seem more practical still. One way to understand these trends, Aboulafia told me, is through the industry’s most beloved metric: the seat mile. If a plane with 300 available seats flies 1,000 miles, that flight clocks up 300,000 seat miles. Airlines are constantly comparing revenue per available seat mile, or Rasm, with cost per available seat mile, or Casm. Aboulafia, pronouncing these terms as “razzum” and “cazzum”, said: “As long as razzum is a nose above cazzum, you’re happy.” In the 70s and the 80s, barring a couple of price spikes, aviation fuel – Jet A-1, as the industry calls it – was cheap. As a result, the industry’s ideas for keeping razzum above cazzum didn’t need to dwell too heavily on the cost of fuel. Instead, airlines pursued their beloved hub-and-spoke model – their elaborate networks that offered journeys only in multiple legs. To cultivate an airport as a hub, an airline booked out most of its landing and takeoff slots, so that it could corner the market on flights serving the surrounding area. After Delta developed the Atlanta airport as a hub, for instance, a customer found it more expensive to fly into the region on any other carrier. In the hub-and-spoke model, passengers flowed thickly from one hub to another, before dispersing in thinner streams to their eventual destinations. To make these hub-to-hub flights, airlines ordered wide-body planes such as the 747, intending to stuff them with up to 500 passengers each. These planes consumed enormous quantities of fuel, and airlines then burned more still by shuttling their passengers from hubs to smaller airports. But the cost of Jet A-1 was so low that it almost didn’t matter. Besides, no matter which plane you flew, the takeoff phase always burned through Jet A-1 the quickest. The most fuel-efficient stage of flight came at cruising altitude, tens of thousands of feet in the air. It seemed to make sense, then, to put as many people as possible into a single takeoff and to then keep them up in the air for as long as possible. The hitch was, though, that airlines couldn’t always pack these massive aircraft to capacity, and they engaged in such ruinous price wars to fill their seats that Rasm suffered. A 2007 book by Adam Pilarski, once the chief economist for the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell-Douglas, carried the plaintive title Why Can’t We Make Money in Aviation? Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/Shutterstock Beginning in the 90s, and continuing well into this century, the price of fuel rose steadily, forcing airlines to re-examine their extravagance with Jet A-1. In 1989, a barrel of oil had cost $10, but in 2008, the price hit $147. In the uncertain years after 9/11, many airlines watched their passenger volumes flag, even as they kept having to pay for the new planes they had ordered years earlier. Ordinarily, airlines might have responded by raising ticket prices – except that, as the industry was fast deregulating everywhere, low-cost carriers emerged as fierce competition. These carriers shrank the cost of flying by doing away with frills such as meals and legroom. “That revolution was brutal,” Aboulafia said. “You couldn’t conduct business as usual.” The hub-and-spoke model appeared to be fading as well. Every city was building itself a decent airport, and people didn’t want to waste their time with layovers and connecting flights. Keeping Casm lower than Rasm needed a fresh approach. Chief among these was to blow less money on Jet A-1. Airlines typically enhance their fuel efficiency by 1%-2% a year, and often these gains are won by tinkering around the edges: lighter seats, less water in the bathroom tanks. In 2017, when United Airlines reduced the weight of its paper in its inflight magazine, it saved nearly 770,000 litres of fuel a year – or $290,000 in costs. Aboulafia told me that, a decade or so ago, many airlines adopted power-washing, which reduces the drag on a plane by stripping it of greater quantities of oil, grime and bug corpses than an ordinary lather could ever do. Separately, several airlines started playing the futures market in fuel, to hedge against sharp price hikes. Delta bought a whole oil refinery near Philadelphia. But the true leaps in efficiency were achieved by new craft, which airlines began to request from manufacturers in the early 00s. The Boeing 787, for example, claims to burn 20% less fuel than its older sibling, the 767. Van Hooff recalled how, when KLM inducted its first 787 into its fleet in 2015, a pilot accustomed to the 747 was appointed to fly it to Dubai. “The 747 is beautiful, but it burns around 11,000 kilos of fuel per hour on a trip like this, so he was used to seeing around 100,000 kilos on his storage gauge when he got into the cockpit,” Van Hooff said. “This time, he saw 50,000. He put in a call to dispatch to ask: ‘Are you really sure this is enough?’ Of course, he knew it was. But he couldn’t get past his gut feeling that he needed more fuel.” Airlines put the 787 and other new planes on to point-to-point routes, slicing the hub out of the hub-and-spoke networks. More and more, Aboulafia said, carriers are buying smaller, single-aisle planes for these direct flights, and shedding their old, large craft. Even before the pandemic, Emirates had already decided not to buy any more Airbus A380s, a plane that costs $500m and can carry up to 868 people – a plane so big that airports have to redo their tarmac and their gates to accommodate it. In July, British Airways decided to retire the 31 Boeing 747s left in its fleet. Airbus A380 planes in storage in Victorville, California in August. Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock Tickets stayed cheap, though, and not just because of the competition from low-cost airlines. Peter Morris, who was once Iata’s chief economist, told me that back in 1995, 25% of the cost of a ticket actually went into producing and selling it: courting travel agents, paying out commissions, printing tickets securely. The internet did away with that, replacing it with attritional algorithm battles. Automated web crawlers alert an airline many times a day if a rival drops its price on a route, so that analysts can decide if their airline can afford to do the same. Boet Kreiken, who once worked for the Dutch Air Force, called the price game “mutually assured destruction”. This is among the reasons, people in the industry kept claiming, that airlines hardly make any money. Morris has no time for these “weepy stories with violin accompaniment that airlines tell”. “The truth is, over the last few years, the airline industry has never been so profitable.” Carriers have pruned their expenses so much, and convinced so many people to fly so often that, despite low prices, Rasm has steadily surpassed Casm. As of last December, the global airline industry had been in the black for 11 straight years. Cheap ticket prices, in fact, are central to an illusion fostered by the airline industry over the past 20 years. The illusion is that the money we pay for a ticket covers the cost of flight in a deeper sense – the cost of transporting us through the air, but also the cost exacted from the environment – and that the booking of a £42 return flight for a stag weekend in Bratislava isn’t worth more than a casual thought. The irony about KLM’s advertisement last year to “Fly Responsibly” is that it came after years of the industry exhorting us to fly irresponsibly. “Do you always need to meet face to face?” the ad chided us gently, as if airlines hadn’t worked to plant in us the belief that face time – to pitch a client, or to lunch with colleagues – was both optimum and trivially inexpensive. Then the coronavirus arrived, the prospect of face-to-face meetings evaporated, and for the first time in decades, flying became a luxury once again. In the depths of the flying freeze, in late April, 166 of KLM’s 204 planes were grounded. Instead of taking them to boneyards, KLM decided to keep them all at Schiphol – pulled up to the departure gates, or parked wing-to-wing in a zigzag pattern on one runway, after steel plates had been laid down so that the combined weight of the aircraft didn’t damage the tarmac. Airplane storage is a funny, delicate affair. The saying “time is money” is so emphatically true in aviation that even planes in long-term storage must be kept as close to airworthy as possible, so that they can bolt into the air to continue earning back their massive price tags. On a video call one August morning, Ton Dortmans, KLM’s head of engineering and maintenance, explained what his team had to do to bed their planes down through the spring and summer. Fuel tanks were emptied, although not entirely: “You still need some weight in the plane, for the bursting wind we get here in Amsterdam.” For the same reason, the blades of the engine fans were locked into place with straps, so that, on gusty days, they didn’t whirl around endlessly and wear their parts out. The water tanks were drained. Engineers 3D-printed covers to place over the small holes on the plane’s surface, which conceal sensors that measure air pressure and altitude. The covers protected them from moisture and insects. Every seven days, someone would climb into the plane and run the engines for 15 minutes to keep them functional. The air conditioning was switched on to keep the humidity at bay. “And the tyres – well, it’s the same as a car. If you keep a car parked for more than a month, you get flat tires,” Dortmans said. So a tug pulled the plane forward and back every month, to keep the wheels and axles in shape. Still, there were some surprises. In the absence of the roar of jets, birds began to appear around Schiphol again, and one day, a ground engineer told Dortmans that he’d found a bird starting to nest in a cavity in the auxiliary power unit. “I’m hearing all these birds and now I find this,” he told Dortmans. “It feels like I’m out in the woods.” Grounded planes in storage in Frankfurt in July 2020. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters Pilots couldn’t be put away in storage in quite the same way. KLM has 3,000 of them, all of whom must fly a minimum number of hours and perform three takeoffs and three landings every 90 days to stay “current” – to still be allowed to pilot a plane. During the lockdown, the pilots on the ground had to retain their currency by rotating through KLM’s nine simulators. From the outside, these simulators look like motorcycle helmets for giants, and a pilot, having climbed into one and closed the hatch, can be put through a pretty immersive rehearsal for flight. The summer slipped by. At some point, a number of pilots had spent six months without going up. Van Hooff resolved that whenever they flew next, they had to do so alongside a trained flight instructor. Flying was its own challenge, because all manner of routine vanished. Week to week, pilots saw their routes and aircraft change, and they touched down into an ever-shifting matrix of rules and norms. US regulations were so inconsistent – which states demanded masks, which states permitted crew members to leave the hotel, which states required them to keep to their rooms – that van Hooff put a team to work just to update these restrictions multiple times a day, and to feed the information up to the planes vaulting over the Atlantic. A source at another European airline, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that after one flight to New York at the peak of its cycle of infection, the plane’s crew felt uncomfortable heading to a city hotel for the night. Instead, they slept in the business-class cabin. A tide of cancellations rolled in. Passenger numbers dropped by 95%, from 9 million in the first quarter of the year to 500,000 in the second. To field complaints and to issue vouchers and consolations, KLM put 800 of its employees on temporary customer-care duties, which they performed from their bedrooms or living rooms. In Manila and in Santiago, call centres were vacated during lockdowns. The staff took their computers home and responded to calls from there. “It was double trouble, triple trouble,” Boet Kreiken, the customer-experience chief at KLM, said. Late in July, Elbers announced that KLM had lost a record €800m in the first half of the year. The airline received a bailout from the Dutch state: €1bn in direct loans, and another €2.4bn in bank loans guaranteed by the government, all with firm strings attached. Costs had to be cut; new environmental conditions had to be met; the airline had to be restructured. Elbers sent around a note to his employees, in which he admitted that these conditions were “difficult” and “raw”. By the end of the summer, the KLM group had announced 4,500-5,000 upcoming job cuts, out of its staff of 33,000 – a combination of layoffs, voluntary retirements, and terminations of temporary contracts. The scenario recurred across the industry. American Airlines plans to slash 40,000 jobs from its workforce. British Airways: 12,000 jobs. Qantas: 6,000. Ryanair: 3,250. The industry will incur losses of $84.3bn this year, Iata estimates – and that’s if there’s no fresh spurt of disease. “It’s going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Elbers keeps warning his colleagues. In his July note to his staff, he offered just one word as KLM’s primary priority: “Survive.” As yet, there has been no comprehensive reckoning of how many tonnes of aviation emissions the pandemic has averted – in part, of course, because the pandemic is still around, and many planes are still grounded. One rough analysis found that the cancellation of 1m flights in March wiped out the equivalent of a month of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions. In March, I met Andreas Schäfer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London’s Energy Institute. Schäfer thinks about aviation and emissions all day long, and had been planning on giving me a lot of data, but his laptop was lethargic that afternoon. He would make an observation and then have to talk around it, marking time while a PowerPoint or a pdf loaded and supplied him with the necessary numbers. Between 1980 and 2015, Schäfer said, aviation emissions increased by 2.2% annually. This isn’t surprising, he noted, because the boosts in fuel efficiency in recent years notwithstanding, there are just more people flying. How many more? He summoned another document and, five minutes later, said: “Ah, here we go!” In those same 35 years, even as planes were using 2% or 3% less fuel every year, the demand for air transportation grew by 5.4% annually. In that difference lies aviation’s contribution to the climate crisis. “Not only airlines, but even plane manufacturers are nervous about the CO2 issue, and about people’s perception of them,” Schäfer said. In 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations body that lays down standards for airlines, set new requirements for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. Three years later, the ICAO adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Corsia, as it’s known, aims to reduce international aviation emissions to half their 2005 levels. Airlines also pledged to purchase carbon offsets to atone for any excess growth in emissions beyond 2020. Grounded planes in Teruel, Spain in May. Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images The incremental rewards of a better engine or a leaner seat will not get airlines to these targets, and they know this. Esmée van Veen, a sustainability manager at KLM, said that the airline had begun a climate action plan in 2008 that relies upon fuel efficiency, biofuels and a voluntary carbon-offset programme, which funnels passengers’ offset payments into a reforestation project in Panama. “We’ve stabilised our carbon emissions, and now we’re ready to decrease it,” she said. In 2011, KLM flew its first commercial flight with biokerosene, made from used cooking oil, added into its fuel mix. “It isn’t much. Right now, it’s about 0.2% of all the fuel we use,” she admitted. Van Veen can outline stages of progress that might eventually turn flying into a zero-carbon enterprise, but she’s careful to note that this is an extrapolation – that it depends on new technologies bearing fruit. By 2030, KLM’s planes taking off from the Netherlands will use a fuel mix that’s 14% biofuel and “synthetic” kerosene, reducing both the need to drill for fresh oil and the emissions that the oil industry spews in the process. Synthetic kerosene – fuel concocted in a refinery – is expected to be made partly from carbon dioxide drawn out of the air, so its overall emissions will be up to 80% less than those from Jet A-1, Van Veen said. Over shorter distances, some planes might be hybrids, powered by batteries as well as fuel. And subsequently, by the middle of the next decade, she said, “we expect there will be a hydrogen-propelled aircraft launched in Europe”. The hydrogen plane is the industry’s recurrent dream, its equivalent of cold fusion or the driverless car. But I also spoke to several people who were sceptical, both of Corsia and of all this nascent green tech. Schäfer thinks Corsia’s targets are timid – that they’ve been set in a way that won’t pinch the industry much. Corsia’s spine is a carbon-offset programme, and offsets are cheap. Brandon Graver, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation, has seen that most of the money from offsets goes into administrative costs, not into actual projects. It’s even doubtful if these projects result in a permanent reduction of carbon, he said. “You hear, ‘Tree planting, tree planting, tree planting’, but only a certain percentage of these trees end up living past a year.” He called offsets “modern-day indulgences”. We pay for our sins to be forgiven, but also for the licence to sin again. The trouble is that the technologies that might usher us into an age of cleaner flight aren’t at hand yet. The volume of biofuel and other alternatives being manufactured is vanishingly small. Graver’s team calculated in 2017 that all the world’s supply would keep the world’s planes in the air for a total of 10 minutes. (Environmental experts worry that biofuels, made out of products such as palm oil, will do more damage than they promise to repair.) If synthetic fuel becomes viable, it will cost more than $3 a gallon at first, Schäfer told me. “Oil is now around $1 a gallon. So why would airlines buy the synthetic stuff?” The battery that’s both small and powerful enough to take a plane across the Atlantic, or from Paris to Perth, is not even on the horizon. In the near term – a timescale that matters enormously to climate change – the only way to decarbonise aviation is to fly less. As an option, that seemed plumb absurd until this year, when we were forced to learn how to live without planes. In the coming years, airlines will be wrenched in two different directions. Their revenues will stay low and wobbly; Iata predicts that passenger numbers will return to pre-pandemic levels only by 2023, but others in the industry grimly cite 2024 or 2025. Simultaneously, many carriers will have to invest in climate change plans, buying offsets or funding research. Already, they’ve had to convince the ICAO to relax some Corsia obligations. In Europe, governments have imposed environmental reforms among the terms for airline bailouts. In return for €7bn, for instance, Air France has committed to halving domestic flight emissions by 2024 and to restricting short-haul flights where trains run instead. In the US, too, the government organised a $25bn aviation bailout, even though the four biggest airlines blew through nearly $40bn in cash over the last five years simply to buy back shares and prop up their stock prices. Here, there were no climate change riders. “Sustainability in the US is marginally more important than keeping enough toner in the fax machine,” Aboulafia told me.

In both the US and Europe, where growth was already slowing, the prompt and full return of customers isn’t at all a sure thing. This is especially true of business flyers. “Covid gives companies a reason to rethink travel expenses,” said Jeff Pelletier, who runs Airline Data, an analysis firm based in Dallas. Business travellers make up 12%-15% of a plane’s passengers, but they sit up front, so they contribute as much as 75% of a flight’s profits on some routes. “Not every company will cut back,” Pelletier said. “But some will. They’ll figure they’d rather spend a couple of bucks on a Zoom meeting instead.” In Asian countries including China and India – markets that have been growing faster than most others, as flights became increasingly affordable – Dennis Lau expects a quicker rebound. Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Cirium, told me that “climate change is not a part of the industry’s conversation here”. Corsia is, for many governments in the region, one more instance of western nations promoting environmental standards that they have violated for decades, and that will curb the economic development of Asian countries. China, India and Russia have agreed to participate in Corsia only from 2027 onwards. And there’s still considerable doubt about how thoroughly Corsia can be enforced, Lau said. “What will you do if countries just refuse to report their emissions?” During my reporting, I kept being told that eventually the pandemic’s effects would fade – that the world’s economy, having been opened wide by affordable flights, couldn’t be zipped shut again, and that people will get back on planes the second they believe it’s safe to fly again. But in the interim, a period of consolidation is in the offing. More airlines might go out of business, and others will be bought by bigger carriers. Airlines will have smaller fleets, Aboulafia wrote in a newsletter. More planes will be smaller, single-aisle jets flying point to point, because while the coronavirus still lurks, no one wants to spend a longer time than necessary in connecting flights or layover airports. Flying will feel both more austere, in these aseptic and functional flights, and more luxurious, since there will be less of it. The end of tourism? Read more In June, KLM’s engineers started to rouse some planes out of their hibernation. They replaced leaking toilet taps, fixed faulty rubber rings and tested the emergency lights. “The second-last thing we do is to check the fire extinguishing systems and the flight controls,” Ton Dortmans, KLM’s engineering chief, told me. “And then the last thing is: we run the engines and put all the systems on again to see if they work – air conditioning, navigation, all of it.” For a brief spell of time, uninhibited travel looked possible again, but then fresh bouts of disease appeared all over the continent. The week I was scheduled to visit KLM in Amsterdam, in mid-August, the UK government announced self-isolation rules for any traveller returning from the Netherlands, so my trip fell through. “You should have been here, to see what we were doing,” Dortmans lamented on our video call. He had been coming up with a fallback scenario for the winter. “It’s a question we have to answer now. If it’s a snowy, hard winter, maybe we have to rethink how our planes are parked here. You have to think about the water and the fuel in the planes, and how they react to freezing temperatures.” If his planes had to be parked for more than 180 days through the winter, Dortmans said, he would think about sending some away. Perhaps to Teruel, or perhaps to the boneyard in California’s Mojave desert, where they will be warmer and drier, and where they can wait to find out if they will be needed again. • This article was amended on 30 September 2020 to correct the fact that Airline Data is based in Dallas, not Houston, as previously stated, and the size of Air France’s bailout from €15bn to €7bn.

As we move away from the traditional 9 to 5, the boundaries between office and home are increasingly blurred. Meet the bosses trying to get it right Rebecca Seal @RebeccaSeal Sat 12 Sep 2020 04.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 23 Sep 2020 10.43 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Photograph: Lol Keegan/The Guardian I am 20 minutes into my scheduled 30-minute call with Shivani Maitra when I start to freeze. Maitra, a partner at global consultancy firm Deloitte, is leading the firm’s post-Covid-19 research into the future of work, and is giving me a seamless analysis of what business is about to look like: more autonomy, more remote work, happier workers, more accessible leadership – all facilitated by technology. But I can’t get Skype for Business to function. It’s a hot day and the connection comes and goes, leaving me contorted and sweating over my laptop. Maitra is not necessarily wrong, but as my kids (aged three and five) thunder into the room, I can’t help but think we have some way to go. Los Angeles-based tech company PORTL Inc has promised that, in five years’ time, we will all be able to beam life-sized, talking holograms of our colleagues into our homes; right now, I think an impenetrable forcefield around my desk would be more useful. “Technology is going to be key to how we work in the future,” Maitra concedes. “But it’s going to be an enabler – it’s not going to be an answer.” It is too early to know exactly what Covid-19 will do to office-based work (you can’t “WFH” – work from home – on a factory line, or as a surgeon, obviously). But many businesses are predicting that whatever happens next – even if there is a vaccine – this moment could represent the end of the nine-to-five as we know it, and in particular the end of vast corporate offices with banks of identikit desks. According to a recent study by Morgan Stanley, only 34% of UK workers who could go back to the office have actually done so, and many businesses have publicly stated that they will extend the option to WFH indefinitely. Facebook has said that 50% of its jobs will be remote within 10 years; Twitter is letting almost all its global workforce WFH forever, if they like; global law firm Slater and Gordon has given up its London office; fund manager Schroders says staff can continue to work flexibly for an indefinite period, as have investment bank JP Morgan and legal firm Linklaters. Work that would previously have been considered impossible to do remotely moved online within a matter of weeks of the UK going into lockdown. But this doesn’t mean all business districts are going to remain ghost towns. Organisations can’t just tear up their leases, and many are wary of going completely remote. They want to keep a space to bring teams together, if only occasionally. How to do this safely, without encasing everyone in Perspex or turning office blocks into hundreds of self-contained pods is the critical question. (Multimillionaire Xu Weiping plans to release prototype cube offices this autumn, as he redevelops part of London’s Royal Albert Dock.) Darren Comber is chief executive of Scott Brownrigg, an international design practice specialising in the built environment, which not only shifted to remote working at the beginning of the pandemic, but also shifted the focus of its 300 staff to looking at ways of minimising contagion. We've been through the biggest work-life experiment in decades. We can say to people: what do workspaces need to be? “One of the biggest things that has to happen is access to fresh air,” he says. “At the moment, only 10% of the air, typically, in an air-conditioned building is fresh, and 90% is recirculating. We’re going to see that flip around completely, because people want cleaner, healthier environments, and are less tolerant of somebody getting a cold at one end of an air-conditioned space, and then everyone getting it. That technology already exists. It’s more expensive, but what’s the human cost? Your staff will simply say, ‘I’m not going to go in.’” Instead, Comber is looking at the introduction of hydroxyl radicals into indoor air. “These occur naturally outside, and are one reason your chances of catching something outdoors are less. UV lighting is making a massive difference, too.” He is keen on giving buildings, including offices, health badges, “in the same way that you have a hygiene rating system for restaurants”. Other tech solutions include contactless facial recognition to gain access to a building; voice-activated doors, windows and blinds; app-controlled vending machines; and smart wearables that detect signs of illness, or alert you whenever someone strays into your personal space. (Raising the question of how much personal data we might be prepared to hand over to our bosses, just to get back to the daily grind.) “We have all just been through the biggest work-life experiment in decades,” says Emma Morley, office designer and founder of trifle* creative, who has worked with companies including online stationers moo.com, Coco de Mer and Soho House. Despite having had to radically alter her latest project, a 40,000 sq ft, 500-person, 25-meeting room office building, she is excited about what this year might offer. (Social distancing means that, where there would have been six desks, there is now only room for two, with wider corridors, and far more circulation space.) “Rather than feeling hindered, let’s turn that around and say we’ve got the greatest opportunity to create a workspace design revolution. We can say to people: what do workspaces really need to be? Because if we don’t need all those desks, happy days. Desks take up 70-80% of space – and if we’ve all got a desk or table at home that we can work on, then when we go into the office it’s about collaboration, socialisation and sharing ideas. I’ve been talking about this for 15 years – about the importance of having different types of space to work, about not filling spaces with desks, because desks are not the best places to come up with ideas. And, now, all of a sudden, it’s here.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Lol Keegan/The Guardian Morley has chosen a hybrid setup for her own team, which she plans to phase in this month, as long as it seems safe to do so. “We will be together two days a week, and three days a week from home,” she says. “As humans, we need to be together. Collaboration does not happen very easily over Zoom.” Even before the pandemic, the senior team at Awin, a global affiliate marketing agency with staff in 20 countries, was planning a major shift away from the office, having already experimented with remote working among its UK staff. When the crisis hit in early March, they were ready. “We didn’t want to take any risks – we shut everything down almost overnight,” says Adam Ross, COO, who was happy to take a breather after six years of constant travel between the UK and Berlin offices. “All 1,200 staff: one day they were in the offices and the next day they weren’t, and everything worked perfectly.” After a virtual workshop in which the board planned for a fully remote 2023, they realised that most of what they wanted to achieve in three years could be done now. When the staff were surveyed and found to be in favour, the board decided not only to move to an entirely remote workforce, but also to a flexible four-day working week (with no salary reduction), which they hope to introduce early next year. “We realised everyone needed more time, whether for home schooling, or younger kids and the nightmare of that. Or if you don’t have family, you need time for you – so we gave everybody Friday afternoons off. It was incredibly well-received, and it didn’t reduce productivity. So we thought, ‘How can we go one better?’” In order to implement a four-day week, “we are looking at automation, easing some of that grunt work. We believe this is the way forward,” Ross says. They intend to shrink their offices, keeping some space for collaboration, but with few or no desks. “We are going to actively discourage coming into the office every day,” Ross says. “We’re very conscious of the pitfalls that might come from having a hybrid situation, because you end up with a weird halfway house and nobody knows where they stand.” A 2019 study published in the academic journal Organization Science showed that remote employees have to do more than their in-house counterparts to get their achievements noticed, often making more personal sacrifices to do so. Although it’s too soon to have data on this, it seems likely that this will apply most to younger or newer remote employees. If you give people trust, and you respect that they need a work-life balance, then they give it back to you in spades “Our younger staff, when we surveyed them, did report that they loved [office] culture,” Ross says. “We had a vibrant atmosphere and a beautiful space. But [the results] were still overwhelmingly in favour of more flexibility, depending on the age group – older staff were less keen on coming in at all, and younger people wanted to come in one or two days a week.” An Awin taskforce is now researching a package to help people work wherever they choose, potentially also contributing to home broadband or utility bills. “If you give people trust, and you respect that they need a work-life balance, then they give it back to you in spades,” Ross explains. At the award-winning architectural firm Selencky Parsons, most of the team are already – safely – back in their London office, with newly spaced-out desks all facing away from each other. “Most of our employees are young, and they don’t have massive homes to work in,” says co-founder David Parsons. The business managed lockdown by instituting virtual morning meetings and Friday beers (they got a local brewery to deliver to everyone’s home), along with Zoom quizzes. “And that was fine for about 10 weeks, but what started to worry me was a lack of enthusiasm in the team.” He also worried that some staff were very lonely. Although there was plenty of work coming in, productivity seemed to drop. “It wasn’t that people weren’t working as hard. It was that they weren’t getting to the answers as quickly – not feeling like they could call and ask any question, at any time, as they would if they were physically next to us.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Lol Keegan/The Guardian His concern was that his younger team members were missing out on both formal and informal incidental learning. “The amount you learn from just listening to other people’s conversations is huge. To be completely isolated from all that, I think, is a big problem,” he says. This year’s abrupt shift to remote work has better suited more experienced workers, who are less in need of on-the-job training and career development, and who are more likely to live somewhere with room for a desk. A woman in her early 30s who works for a large organisation (and asked to be anonymous) told me, “It’s quite a shock, as when all this started we were told to expect a phased return in September, and then maybe not till next year. But now it’s pretty much: ‘Expect this indefinitely, with the odd day in.’ I am still coming to terms with it. I’m single, so it really is just me, all day long. Working from home suits middle-class families who have enough space and a garden. I worry about my future and meeting new people organically.” Another woman told me about a flatshare in which the living room had been repurposed as a bedroom, to lower the rent; as a consequence, four people were all working full-time in the kitchen. Untold numbers are perched at worktops, on their beds or, in the case of my friend Jo, an ironing board. Remote work may be very hard for some (it is also tough on carers of all kinds), but in the longer run, the tilt away from five days in the office may mean more choice about where to live. If you’re only visiting the office once or twice a week, you can live farther from it, perhaps somewhere more affordable. If you rarely visit at all, you can, in theory, live almost anywhere. And, as Maitra points out, this could create a more diverse workforce: “The most far-reaching effect is going to be [organisations saying]: ‘You can live anywhere you want to, but you could still come and work for me.’ People then don’t have to live in expensive city flats.” Will workforces move away from cities in general, and from overpriced London and the south-east in particular? The book publisher Hachette recently surveyed its staff about which UK cities they would like to live in, and is now hunting for regional hub offices in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester, Sheffield and Bristol to match the results. The pandemic has opened up a home-buying rush in the countryside: inquiries from city dwellers across the UK who want to move to a village are up 125%, according to Rightmove – and one reason is the disappearance of the commute. The boundary between on and off is very blurred. We’re all vying to show how productive we are Some of the downsides to remote working will take longer to reveal themselves. While people working from home may currently appear highly productive, pre-Covid research by Cardiff University, carried out in 2017, showed that they are also prone to longer hours, and struggle to set boundaries between work and home life. Even before the pandemic, remote workers reported comparatively high stress levels, according to a 2017 UN report (41% of remote workers compared with 25% of office workers). For every Awin, which has 70 volunteers working in five taskforces (known as Wherever/Whenever; Office Redesign; Four-Day Week; Change in Mindset and Culture; Ease Workloads), there is another organisation whose employees feel abandoned. “My company has decided to go fully remote and I am despairing about it,” says Paul, an IT developer. “I used to be notorious for how fast I worked, but it was because I’d give myself incentives – lunch with a colleague, or getting out on time for a drink. Now I mostly feel like I’m wading through treacle.” Some employees are working at an unsustainable speed because they don’t want to be forced back into an office, or because they are afraid they will lose their jobs. Juliet, who works in exhibitions, tells me: “Everybody is up for the chop. I’m trying to be as indispensable as I can. I find myself logging on at all times. The boundary between on and off is very blurred. We’re all vying to show how productive we are.” Laura, a manager who works in the energy industry, also struggles with virtual presenteeism. “Leading a team, I feel pressure to be available and online through extended hours. I need to believe it’s OK to close the laptop and switch off.” Lucy, who works in marketing and has small children, tells me she is at breaking point: “Every moment is interrupted or interruptible. My husband and I both work every weekday evening to keep up, despite not having a commute to eat into our time. There are no real breaks.” This autumn marks a critical moment in our work culture: could it be the tipping point where office work changes unrecognisably, and for the better? Or will less enlightened organisations see it as a chance to lower their overheads, encouraging staff to work remotely and then failing to support or nurture them? For now, a hybrid model, blending the best of both worlds, looks the best bet. If you eliminate the office completely, Emma Morley argues, you eliminate “the culture and community that a business creates, and the opportunities for human beings to thrive and grow”. Whatever they choose to do, employers need to embrace the fact that this has been a year of unimaginably rapid change for their staff. Getting work wrong could lead to an epidemic of burnout. But getting it right could have huge dividends, for everyone. All employee names have been changed. • Solo: How To Work Alone (And Not Lose Your Mind), by Rebecca Seal, is published by Profile Books on 17 September at £14.99.

It might come in handy for us all… David Robson Sat 26 Sep 2020 12.00 EDT Last modified on Mon 28 Sep 2020 09.24 EDT When Kari Leibowitz first arrived in the Norwegian city of Tromsø, she was both intrigued by, and fearful of, the approaching winter. Two hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, the city does not see the sun from mid-November to mid-January. It was a far cry from the state of New Jersey, where she had grown up, or Stanford, California, where she had been studying before travelling to Norway. As a health psychologist, Leibowitz’s aim was to understand the ways that Tromsø’s citizens coped with the long “polar night”. In many countries, the short days of winter are thought to cause lethargy and low mood, resulting in “seasonal affective disorder” (SAD). This is sometimes assumed to have a purely biological basis – levels of mood-regulating neurotransmitters such as serotonin are generally lower in winter than in summer, and last week a study suggested that people with more neurotic personalities are particularly susceptible to low winter moods. SAD is often treated using standard antidepressant drugs, as well as psychotherapies. During the darkest periods of the polar night, Tromsø only receives two to three hours of indirect sunlight, shining into the sky from below the horizon. Yet its inhabitants do not show the kind of wintertime depression you might expect of a city cast in darkness. One study by May Trude Johnsen at the University of Tromsø found that the citizens’ wellbeing barely changed across the year. Their sleep was a bit more disturbed without the daily rhythm of the rising and setting sun, but they reported no increase in mental distress during the winter. So what’s their secret? Of the many potential explanations, Leibowitz’s work suggests that one vital component may be a particular “mindset” that arms the citizens against the stresses of the long polar night. Tromso at night. Photograph: RelaxFoto.de/Getty Images These lessons could not be more timely. We may not live in the far north, but many of us in Europe and the US find winter to be the cruellest of all seasons – and that’s without the shadow of a global pandemic. Last week the Observer reported that as we face the daunting prospect of a second lockdown in cold dark conditions Brits have been stocking up on patio heaters and fire pits but, consumerism aside, what might we learn from the Norwegians’ psychological resilience? Leibowitz’s findings build on decades of previous research showing that the mental framing of stressful events can powerfully influence the ways we are affected by them. People who see stressful events as “challenges”, with an opportunity to learn and adapt, tend to cope much better than those who focus more on the threatening aspects – like the possibility of failure, embarrassment or illness. These differences in mindset not only influence people’s mood, but also their physiological responses, such as changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and how quickly they recover after the event. And the impact can be long-lasting, even during major transitions: one Israeli study found that immigrants’ stress appraisals can predict how well they adjust to their new country. They also seem to determine how well police officers in Australia cope with the stresses of their work. Needless to say, our appraisal of whether an event feels like a threat, or an opportunity, will depend on our circumstances and our resources to handle the problems we encounter. But it is sometimes possible to change our appraisal of a situation consciously. In one memorable experiment, Alison Wood Brooks, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, asked participants to face their fears of public speaking. Brooks found that simply asking the participants to repeat the phrase “I am excited” helped to reduce their anxious feelings and led to a better overall performance, since it encouraged them to view the situation as a new challenge rather than a threat. Many psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy, have also been found to increase our resilience by helping us to reframe stressful events in more constructive ways. To test whether a difference in outlook could also explain the resilience of Tromsø’s residents, Leibowitz designed the “wintertime mindset scale”, which asked participants to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with statements such as There are many things to enjoy about the winter I love the cosiness of the winter months Winter brings many wonderful seasonal changes And Winter is boring Winter is a limiting time of year There are many things to dislike about winter Sure enough, she found that participants’ answers predicted their wellbeing over the coming months; the more they saw the winter as an exciting opportunity to enjoy a glacial climate, the better they fared, with high levels of life satisfaction and overall mental health. Amazingly, Leibowitz found that these attitudes actually increase with latitude, in the regions where the winters will be even harsher. People in Svalbard (at 78 deg north) had a more positive mindset than the people in Tromsø (69 deg north), who took a more optimistic view than people in Oslo (60 deg north). In other words, the positive wintertime mindset is most common where it’s most needed. Most people don’t realise their beliefs about winter are subjective. They feel there’s nothing they can do about it Kari Leibowitz These positive attitudes were apparent in Leibowitz’s casual conversations; indeed, she says that many of her friends struggled to understand why you would not enjoy winter. They embraced the possibility of skiing or hiking in the mountains, and savoured the chance to practice koselig – a Norwegian version of Denmark’s hygge – which might involve snuggling under blankets with a warm drink in the candlelight. Far from dwindling in the dark, Tromsø’s community flourished in the long polar night. “There is this interaction between the culture that you’re part of, and the mentality or mindset that grows out of it,” says Prof Joar Vittersø, Leibowitz’s collaborator at the Arctic University of Tromsø. Surrounded by Norwegian positivity, Leibowitz soon found her own mindset shifting; she learned to love long walks with a headlamp to guide her path. And rather than yearning for sunlight, she came to appreciate the “soft, peaceful” appearance of the city in the darkness. “When it was snowing, I would always try to go out and enjoy the fresh snowfall.” She suspects that many other people could follow suit, once they find out about this research. “Most people don’t realise that their beliefs about winter are subjective,” says Leibowitz, whose research is currently under peer review. “They feel like they’re just someone who hates the winter and there’s nothing they can do about it… But once you put it in people’s heads that mindsets exist, and that you have control over your mindset – I think that that’s tremendously powerful.” Fjord focus: is Norway's friluftsliv the answer to surviving a second lockdown? Read more Leibowitz conducted her initial studies long before the new coronavirus left Wuhan – and she is realistic about the challenges of trying to see the positive in the pandemic. “A change in mindset is not a cure-all for everything,” she emphasises. It can’t simply eliminate our anxieties about the job insecurity or the fear of losing a loved one, and we should not attempt to suppress those emotions. Even so, she suspects that adopting the positive wintertime mindset could make a second lockdown a little less daunting for those who worry about keeping their mood buoyed in the bad weather. We might recognise, for instance, that it’s a time for baking comfort food or cosy evenings curled up under a blanket in front of a box set – practising a little bit of the Norwegian koselig. And if we normally exercise on a running machine, we might try to find value in a bracing jog in the elements. Since the risk of contagion is much lower outside, we might also adapt to the Scandinavian way of outdoor socialising (lockdown regulations permitting). Tromsø, for example, has an open-air cinema, so residents can enjoy atmospheric film screenings in the eerie Arctic darkness. As the Norwegians say: “There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes.” This time, we do at least have the advantage of knowing what did and didn’t work during the first lockdown, so we can be more realistic in our expectations of what we can and can’t achieve, focusing our efforts on the small actions that bring the most comfort, rather than aiming to write a bestselling novel, say. A recent study by Prof Hannes Zacher, a psychologist at Leipzig University, shows that our personal framing of the pandemic has already had a small but significant effect on our responses during the crisis so far. ‘The more people saw the winter as an exciting opportunity, the better their wellbeing.’ Photograph: DieterMeyrl/Getty Images The survey, which was set up before the crisis, ran from December 2019 to May this year – and as you might expect, there was a significant drop in life satisfaction and positive mood after the pandemic hit Europe. But certain psychological characteristics and coping strategies seemed to protect some people from the worst effects. This included “active coping” – such as setting up a proper office at home, scheduling home-schooling times for the children, and making sure to eat well, sleep well, and exercise, Zacher says. As the previous research predicted, the most resilient participants also managed to recognise the potential opportunities in the crisis – such as “learning something from the experience, or trying to grow as a person as a result from the experience,” Zacher explains. Like Leibowitz, Zacher emphasises that the aim is not to sugar-coat the situation or to deny the difficulties that we will face; we can’t hide from the shadow cast by the pandemic, any more than the citizens of Tromsø can pretend that the sun is still rising. By recognising our own capacity to control our responses to the lockdown and the changing seasons, however, we may all find some hidden reserves of strength and resilience to see us through the days ahead. • David Robson is a science writer and author of The Intelligence Trap: Revolutionise Your Thinking and Make Wiser Decisions (Hodder & Stoughton £9.99).

Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters The long read Inside the airline industry's meltdown Passenger planes grounded in Birmingham, Alabama, in March. Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Coronavirus has hit few sectors harder than air travel, wiping out tens of thousands of jobs and uncountable billions in revenue. While most fleets were grounded, the industry was forced to reimagine its future by Samanth Subramanian Tue 29 Sep 2020 01.00 EDT Last modified on Tue 6 Oct 2020 11.21 EDT When an airline no longer wants a plane, it is sent away to a boneyard, a storage facility where it sits outdoors on a paved lot, wingtip to wingtip with other unwanted planes. From the air, the planes look like the bleached remains of some long-forgotten skeleton. Europe’s biggest boneyard is built on the site of a late-30s airfield in Teruel, in eastern Spain, where the dry climate is kind to metallic airframes. Many planes are here for short-term storage, biding their time while they change owners or undergo maintenance. If their future is less clear, they enter long-term storage. Sometimes a plane’s limbo ends when it is taken apart, its body rendered efficiently down into spare parts and recycled metal. In February, Patrick Lecer, the CEO of Tarmac Aerosave, the company that owns the Teruel boneyard and three others in France, had one eye cocked towards China. Lecer has been in aviation long enough to remember flights being grounded during the Sars epidemic in 2003. This year, when the coronavirus spread beyond Asia, he knew what was coming. “We started making space in our sites, playing Tetris with the aircraft to free up two or three or four more spaces in each,” he told me. By late March, after the US shut its skies to Europe, planes began streaming into Tarmac Aerosave’s boneyards. No one knew if they were going into short-term residency or long-term storage. On one day alone, 3 April, the Teruel boneyard received five Boeing 747s and two Boeing 777s. Throughout the next few weeks, planes arrived from Lufthansa, Air France, Etihad and British Airways. Before the pandemic, there were 78 aircraft at Teruel. By June, there were 114, running near the full capacity of 120-130. Patrick Lecer’s other three boneyards were also “close to saturation”, he told me in July. He sounded grave. He had just spent two hours on the phone with an airline that wanted him to house another 30 planes. “I’ve been in this business almost 40 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this. The mood is bad. It feels like a tragedy.” Among all the industries hit by Covid-19, aviation suffered in two distinct ways. Most obviously, there was the fear of contagion. No other business depends on putting you into knee-by-thigh proximity with strangers for hours, while whisking potentially diseased humans from one continent to another. Less directly, there was the tumbling economy. It is an axiom in aviation that air travel correlates to GDP. When people have more money, they fly more. But in the midst of this historic downturn, no one was buying plane tickets. In the past, airlines have only been stung by one or the other of these factors. During Sars, travel was unsafe, but the global economy didn’t flatline. During the 2008 financial crash, money was tight, but flying was not a health risk. In the 110 years since the dawn of commercial flight, these blows had never been dealt in tandem, until this year. Planes grounded by coronavirus pandemic sit idle at airports around the world – in pictures Read more To customers, investors and airlines, an earthbound existence was unimaginable before the coronavirus. For commercial aviation, the past two decades have been a period of superheated growth. In 1998, airlines sold 1.46bn tickets for one kind of flight or another. By 2019, that number had shot up to 4.54bn. This year has undone it all. Early in March, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) published two potential scenarios. The more extreme one forecast a global loss of revenue of $113bn. By mid-April, about 14,400 passenger planes around the world – 65% of the global fleet – had been placed into storage, according to the aviation research firm Cirium. Companies that have been brought to the brink, or in some cases collapsed entirely, include Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic, Flybe in the UK, South African Airways, LATAM and Avianca in South America, Compass and Trans States in the US. Airlines for America, a trade group, calculated that the last time the US averaged fewer than 100,000 daily passengers was in 1954. Emirates became so desperate for passengers that it promised to shell out $1,765 for a funeral if anyone died of Covid-19 after flying with them. By June, Iata had to issue a revision: Revenues will fall by $419bn this year, precisely half of what airlines earned in 2019. These numbers are scarcely credible, even to industry veterans. Boet Kreiken, the executive vice-president for customer experience at the Dutch carrier KLM, recalled a meeting early in the pandemic, in KLM’s offices near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. His colleagues had brought in the latest figures for new bookings and the dismal projections for the summer ahead. “I’ve seen some crises in my time – the Iraq war, 9/11, Sars, the Icelandic volcano eruption,” Kreiken said. “I know in the gut what that feels like. But this was something else. I was staring at the chart and got so involved in thinking about the consequences that the others had to tell me twice: ‘Boet, start the meeting!’” JFK airport in New York in April. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Prior to the pandemic, airlines had been wrestling with a different motivation against flying. Aviation accounts for 12% of all carbon dioxide emissions from transport, and flying is so cheap and easy that we can add unthinkingly to that gush of carbon in the seconds it takes to book a ticket on an app. London to New York and back creates 986kg of carbon dioxide – more than the average person in Madagascar or Nicaragua generates in a year. Last year, KLM unveiled an initiative that sounded like a plea for less business. “Do you always need to meet face to face? Could you take the train instead?” a voiceover in an advert asked. “We all have to fly every now and then. But next time, think about flying responsibly.” (“There was a little bit of bravery in that,” a KLM executive told me. “It had to be pitched to the board three times before they approved it.”) The ad, bold as it was, also fit a broader pattern. As ever, individuals are being requested to tame their habits of consumption, even while governments and large corporations do far less than they might to curb their expenditure of carbon. At the same time, we’re assured by airline companies that our self-restraint has to be only temporary, and that some technological salvation – a plane running on batteries or hydrogen – will let us return to our habits very soon. This year, as the industry’s fortunes tumbled, and as executives attempted to run their airlines even while most of their planes stayed on the ground, a different kind of technological salvationalism emerged. The future of flight now appears to be pinned on the discovery of a successful Covid-19 vaccine. The important problem of how much we ought to be flying gave way to the even more basic uncertainty of when and in what fashion we will ever fly regularly again at all. KLM calls itself the world’s oldest commercial airline, by which it means it’s the oldest airline still operating under its original name. Last October, KLM turned 100, and Pieter Elbers, its CEO, was feeling cheerful. Elbers joined the airline in 1992, when he was 22, and worked all over the world before reaching the top in 2014. He told me that KLM’s profit margin for that year was a slender 2%. “From that, we moved to 8% last year, so there was a really positive, upbeat atmosphere.” By December 2019, he’d flown to so many KLM offices around the world to celebrate the centenary that he decided to spend New Year’s Eve at home in Amsterdam. A couple of weeks later, when KLM’s partner airlines in China began suspending operations, Elbers heard the first murmurs about a strange new virus. Figuring that China would soon contain the disease, Elbers and his team cut down the frequency of KLM’s flights to China, reallocating those planes to US routes instead. By February, though, the pandemic had spread to Europe; by March, the Netherlands had locked down. At the KLM offices, only Elbers and half a dozen executives continued to come in to work, to wrestle with the crisis. Elbers left home at 6.30am every day and drove half an hour on vacant roads. “Everyone sat in my office, since it’s spacious enough to still be able to keep a good distance from each other.” Sometimes he would wander over to Schiphol and gaze at the slumbering planes and the desolate terminal. The airline industry’s metabolism is ordinarily slow – planes ordered years in advance, routes plotted and pilots trained with measured care. During the pandemic, though, decisions had to be made with uncommon speed. Late in March, for instance, a KLM flight somewhere above Novosibirsk, bearing towards Shanghai, was told that every incoming flight crew now had to quarantine for 14 days in a Chinese state hospital. This rule was so new that it hadn’t existed when the plane left Amsterdam; circumstances had changed mid flight. Executives scrambled to get an approved exemption from Dutch and Chinese authorities so that the crew could stay aboard the plane in Shanghai and bring it home 18 hours later. KLM planes grounded at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, March 2020. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock The same month, Elbers retired three Boeing 747s – huge, fuel-guzzling craft that were on the verge of being put out to pasture anyway. Mere weeks later, they had to be hastily pulled out of storage and pressed into service to ferry medical equipment and PPE from China to the Netherlands. There were complicated repatriation flights to be flown. Two thousand Dutch travellers had to be retrieved from Australia. The first repatriation flight to Sydney had to leave with 48 hours’ notice, but it had been 20 years since KLM had flown there – so long that the routes and permits had to be plotted afresh and reloaded into flight computers. Usually, airline representatives convene at “slot conferences” twice a year, to divvy up landing and takeoff slots in airports around the world for the season ahead, said Vincent van Hooff, who oversees KLM’s flight operations. “We are not in the ad-hoc business. But now it was a totally new game. Would we still be flying to London tomorrow? Would we need more slots for repatriation flights? It was almost as if we had suddenly become a charter company.” Amid this mayhem, the pandemic’s effects upon aviation seemed sudden and tectonic. Richard Aboulafia has an alternate view: “Nothing new is happening. It’s just happening faster.” Aboulafia is the vice-president of analysis at Teal Group, an aviation market research firm, and every month he sends out a chatty newsletter that is widely read in the industry. “Dear Fellow Dark Cloud Dwellers,” he wrote in May, peering ahead at the contours of a post-Covid industry. Airlines will hoard cash, he predicted. They will choose smaller, more efficient planes. They will fly more point-to-point routes, leaving behind the old hub-and-spoke networks – the kind that require us to fly from one town to another in a minimum of two legs, via a “hub” airport in a major metropolis. But these changes were under way even last year, he argued. The coronavirus has only made them seem more practical still. One way to understand these trends, Aboulafia told me, is through the industry’s most beloved metric: the seat mile. If a plane with 300 available seats flies 1,000 miles, that flight clocks up 300,000 seat miles. Airlines are constantly comparing revenue per available seat mile, or Rasm, with cost per available seat mile, or Casm. Aboulafia, pronouncing these terms as “razzum” and “cazzum”, said: “As long as razzum is a nose above cazzum, you’re happy.” In the 70s and the 80s, barring a couple of price spikes, aviation fuel – Jet A-1, as the industry calls it – was cheap. As a result, the industry’s ideas for keeping razzum above cazzum didn’t need to dwell too heavily on the cost of fuel. Instead, airlines pursued their beloved hub-and-spoke model – their elaborate networks that offered journeys only in multiple legs. To cultivate an airport as a hub, an airline booked out most of its landing and takeoff slots, so that it could corner the market on flights serving the surrounding area. After Delta developed the Atlanta airport as a hub, for instance, a customer found it more expensive to fly into the region on any other carrier. In the hub-and-spoke model, passengers flowed thickly from one hub to another, before dispersing in thinner streams to their eventual destinations. To make these hub-to-hub flights, airlines ordered wide-body planes such as the 747, intending to stuff them with up to 500 passengers each. These planes consumed enormous quantities of fuel, and airlines then burned more still by shuttling their passengers from hubs to smaller airports. But the cost of Jet A-1 was so low that it almost didn’t matter. Besides, no matter which plane you flew, the takeoff phase always burned through Jet A-1 the quickest. The most fuel-efficient stage of flight came at cruising altitude, tens of thousands of feet in the air. It seemed to make sense, then, to put as many people as possible into a single takeoff and to then keep them up in the air for as long as possible. The hitch was, though, that airlines couldn’t always pack these massive aircraft to capacity, and they engaged in such ruinous price wars to fill their seats that Rasm suffered. A 2007 book by Adam Pilarski, once the chief economist for the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell-Douglas, carried the plaintive title Why Can’t We Make Money in Aviation? Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/Shutterstock Beginning in the 90s, and continuing well into this century, the price of fuel rose steadily, forcing airlines to re-examine their extravagance with Jet A-1. In 1989, a barrel of oil had cost $10, but in 2008, the price hit $147. In the uncertain years after 9/11, many airlines watched their passenger volumes flag, even as they kept having to pay for the new planes they had ordered years earlier. Ordinarily, airlines might have responded by raising ticket prices – except that, as the industry was fast deregulating everywhere, low-cost carriers emerged as fierce competition. These carriers shrank the cost of flying by doing away with frills such as meals and legroom. “That revolution was brutal,” Aboulafia said. “You couldn’t conduct business as usual.” The hub-and-spoke model appeared to be fading as well. Every city was building itself a decent airport, and people didn’t want to waste their time with layovers and connecting flights. Keeping Casm lower than Rasm needed a fresh approach. Chief among these was to blow less money on Jet A-1. Airlines typically enhance their fuel efficiency by 1%-2% a year, and often these gains are won by tinkering around the edges: lighter seats, less water in the bathroom tanks. In 2017, when United Airlines reduced the weight of its paper in its inflight magazine, it saved nearly 770,000 litres of fuel a year – or $290,000 in costs. Aboulafia told me that, a decade or so ago, many airlines adopted power-washing, which reduces the drag on a plane by stripping it of greater quantities of oil, grime and bug corpses than an ordinary lather could ever do. Separately, several airlines started playing the futures market in fuel, to hedge against sharp price hikes. Delta bought a whole oil refinery near Philadelphia. But the true leaps in efficiency were achieved by new craft, which airlines began to request from manufacturers in the early 00s. The Boeing 787, for example, claims to burn 20% less fuel than its older sibling, the 767. Van Hooff recalled how, when KLM inducted its first 787 into its fleet in 2015, a pilot accustomed to the 747 was appointed to fly it to Dubai. “The 747 is beautiful, but it burns around 11,000 kilos of fuel per hour on a trip like this, so he was used to seeing around 100,000 kilos on his storage gauge when he got into the cockpit,” Van Hooff said. “This time, he saw 50,000. He put in a call to dispatch to ask: ‘Are you really sure this is enough?’ Of course, he knew it was. But he couldn’t get past his gut feeling that he needed more fuel.” Airlines put the 787 and other new planes on to point-to-point routes, slicing the hub out of the hub-and-spoke networks. More and more, Aboulafia said, carriers are buying smaller, single-aisle planes for these direct flights, and shedding their old, large craft. Even before the pandemic, Emirates had already decided not to buy any more Airbus A380s, a plane that costs $500m and can carry up to 868 people – a plane so big that airports have to redo their tarmac and their gates to accommodate it. In July, British Airways decided to retire the 31 Boeing 747s left in its fleet. Airbus A380 planes in storage in Victorville, California in August. Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock Tickets stayed cheap, though, and not just because of the competition from low-cost airlines. Peter Morris, who was once Iata’s chief economist, told me that back in 1995, 25% of the cost of a ticket actually went into producing and selling it: courting travel agents, paying out commissions, printing tickets securely. The internet did away with that, replacing it with attritional algorithm battles. Automated web crawlers alert an airline many times a day if a rival drops its price on a route, so that analysts can decide if their airline can afford to do the same. Boet Kreiken, who once worked for the Dutch Air Force, called the price game “mutually assured destruction”. This is among the reasons, people in the industry kept claiming, that airlines hardly make any money. Morris has no time for these “weepy stories with violin accompaniment that airlines tell”. “The truth is, over the last few years, the airline industry has never been so profitable.” Carriers have pruned their expenses so much, and convinced so many people to fly so often that, despite low prices, Rasm has steadily surpassed Casm. As of last December, the global airline industry had been in the black for 11 straight years. Cheap ticket prices, in fact, are central to an illusion fostered by the airline industry over the past 20 years. The illusion is that the money we pay for a ticket covers the cost of flight in a deeper sense – the cost of transporting us through the air, but also the cost exacted from the environment – and that the booking of a £42 return flight for a stag weekend in Bratislava isn’t worth more than a casual thought. The irony about KLM’s advertisement last year to “Fly Responsibly” is that it came after years of the industry exhorting us to fly irresponsibly. “Do you always need to meet face to face?” the ad chided us gently, as if airlines hadn’t worked to plant in us the belief that face time – to pitch a client, or to lunch with colleagues – was both optimum and trivially inexpensive. Then the coronavirus arrived, the prospect of face-to-face meetings evaporated, and for the first time in decades, flying became a luxury once again. In the depths of the flying freeze, in late April, 166 of KLM’s 204 planes were grounded. Instead of taking them to boneyards, KLM decided to keep them all at Schiphol – pulled up to the departure gates, or parked wing-to-wing in a zigzag pattern on one runway, after steel plates had been laid down so that the combined weight of the aircraft didn’t damage the tarmac. Airplane storage is a funny, delicate affair. The saying “time is money” is so emphatically true in aviation that even planes in long-term storage must be kept as close to airworthy as possible, so that they can bolt into the air to continue earning back their massive price tags. On a video call one August morning, Ton Dortmans, KLM’s head of engineering and maintenance, explained what his team had to do to bed their planes down through the spring and summer. Fuel tanks were emptied, although not entirely: “You still need some weight in the plane, for the bursting wind we get here in Amsterdam.” For the same reason, the blades of the engine fans were locked into place with straps, so that, on gusty days, they didn’t whirl around endlessly and wear their parts out. The water tanks were drained. Engineers 3D-printed covers to place over the small holes on the plane’s surface, which conceal sensors that measure air pressure and altitude. The covers protected them from moisture and insects. Every seven days, someone would climb into the plane and run the engines for 15 minutes to keep them functional. The air conditioning was switched on to keep the humidity at bay. “And the tyres – well, it’s the same as a car. If you keep a car parked for more than a month, you get flat tires,” Dortmans said. So a tug pulled the plane forward and back every month, to keep the wheels and axles in shape. Still, there were some surprises. In the absence of the roar of jets, birds began to appear around Schiphol again, and one day, a ground engineer told Dortmans that he’d found a bird starting to nest in a cavity in the auxiliary power unit. “I’m hearing all these birds and now I find this,” he told Dortmans. “It feels like I’m out in the woods.” Grounded planes in storage in Frankfurt in July 2020. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters Pilots couldn’t be put away in storage in quite the same way. KLM has 3,000 of them, all of whom must fly a minimum number of hours and perform three takeoffs and three landings every 90 days to stay “current” – to still be allowed to pilot a plane. During the lockdown, the pilots on the ground had to retain their currency by rotating through KLM’s nine simulators. From the outside, these simulators look like motorcycle helmets for giants, and a pilot, having climbed into one and closed the hatch, can be put through a pretty immersive rehearsal for flight. The summer slipped by. At some point, a number of pilots had spent six months without going up. Van Hooff resolved that whenever they flew next, they had to do so alongside a trained flight instructor. Flying was its own challenge, because all manner of routine vanished. Week to week, pilots saw their routes and aircraft change, and they touched down into an ever-shifting matrix of rules and norms. US regulations were so inconsistent – which states demanded masks, which states permitted crew members to leave the hotel, which states required them to keep to their rooms – that van Hooff put a team to work just to update these restrictions multiple times a day, and to feed the information up to the planes vaulting over the Atlantic. A source at another European airline, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that after one flight to New York at the peak of its cycle of infection, the plane’s crew felt uncomfortable heading to a city hotel for the night. Instead, they slept in the business-class cabin. A tide of cancellations rolled in. Passenger numbers dropped by 95%, from 9 million in the first quarter of the year to 500,000 in the second. To field complaints and to issue vouchers and consolations, KLM put 800 of its employees on temporary customer-care duties, which they performed from their bedrooms or living rooms. In Manila and in Santiago, call centres were vacated during lockdowns. The staff took their computers home and responded to calls from there. “It was double trouble, triple trouble,” Boet Kreiken, the customer-experience chief at KLM, said. Late in July, Elbers announced that KLM had lost a record €800m in the first half of the year. The airline received a bailout from the Dutch state: €1bn in direct loans, and another €2.4bn in bank loans guaranteed by the government, all with firm strings attached. Costs had to be cut; new environmental conditions had to be met; the airline had to be restructured. Elbers sent around a note to his employees, in which he admitted that these conditions were “difficult” and “raw”. By the end of the summer, the KLM group had announced 4,500-5,000 upcoming job cuts, out of its staff of 33,000 – a combination of layoffs, voluntary retirements, and terminations of temporary contracts. The scenario recurred across the industry. American Airlines plans to slash 40,000 jobs from its workforce. British Airways: 12,000 jobs. Qantas: 6,000. Ryanair: 3,250. The industry will incur losses of $84.3bn this year, Iata estimates – and that’s if there’s no fresh spurt of disease. “It’s going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Elbers keeps warning his colleagues. In his July note to his staff, he offered just one word as KLM’s primary priority: “Survive.” As yet, there has been no comprehensive reckoning of how many tonnes of aviation emissions the pandemic has averted – in part, of course, because the pandemic is still around, and many planes are still grounded. One rough analysis found that the cancellation of 1m flights in March wiped out the equivalent of a month of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions. In March, I met Andreas Schäfer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London’s Energy Institute. Schäfer thinks about aviation and emissions all day long, and had been planning on giving me a lot of data, but his laptop was lethargic that afternoon. He would make an observation and then have to talk around it, marking time while a PowerPoint or a pdf loaded and supplied him with the necessary numbers. Between 1980 and 2015, Schäfer said, aviation emissions increased by 2.2% annually. This isn’t surprising, he noted, because the boosts in fuel efficiency in recent years notwithstanding, there are just more people flying. How many more? He summoned another document and, five minutes later, said: “Ah, here we go!” In those same 35 years, even as planes were using 2% or 3% less fuel every year, the demand for air transportation grew by 5.4% annually. In that difference lies aviation’s contribution to the climate crisis. “Not only airlines, but even plane manufacturers are nervous about the CO2 issue, and about people’s perception of them,” Schäfer said. In 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations body that lays down standards for airlines, set new requirements for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. Three years later, the ICAO adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Corsia, as it’s known, aims to reduce international aviation emissions to half their 2005 levels. Airlines also pledged to purchase carbon offsets to atone for any excess growth in emissions beyond 2020. Grounded planes in Teruel, Spain in May. Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images The incremental rewards of a better engine or a leaner seat will not get airlines to these targets, and they know this. Esmée van Veen, a sustainability manager at KLM, said that the airline had begun a climate action plan in 2008 that relies upon fuel efficiency, biofuels and a voluntary carbon-offset programme, which funnels passengers’ offset payments into a reforestation project in Panama. “We’ve stabilised our carbon emissions, and now we’re ready to decrease it,” she said. In 2011, KLM flew its first commercial flight with biokerosene, made from used cooking oil, added into its fuel mix. “It isn’t much. Right now, it’s about 0.2% of all the fuel we use,” she admitted. Van Veen can outline stages of progress that might eventually turn flying into a zero-carbon enterprise, but she’s careful to note that this is an extrapolation – that it depends on new technologies bearing fruit. By 2030, KLM’s planes taking off from the Netherlands will use a fuel mix that’s 14% biofuel and “synthetic” kerosene, reducing both the need to drill for fresh oil and the emissions that the oil industry spews in the process. Synthetic kerosene – fuel concocted in a refinery – is expected to be made partly from carbon dioxide drawn out of the air, so its overall emissions will be up to 80% less than those from Jet A-1, Van Veen said. Over shorter distances, some planes might be hybrids, powered by batteries as well as fuel. And subsequently, by the middle of the next decade, she said, “we expect there will be a hydrogen-propelled aircraft launched in Europe”. The hydrogen plane is the industry’s recurrent dream, its equivalent of cold fusion or the driverless car. But I also spoke to several people who were sceptical, both of Corsia and of all this nascent green tech. Schäfer thinks Corsia’s targets are timid – that they’ve been set in a way that won’t pinch the industry much. Corsia’s spine is a carbon-offset programme, and offsets are cheap. Brandon Graver, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation, has seen that most of the money from offsets goes into administrative costs, not into actual projects. It’s even doubtful if these projects result in a permanent reduction of carbon, he said. “You hear, ‘Tree planting, tree planting, tree planting’, but only a certain percentage of these trees end up living past a year.” He called offsets “modern-day indulgences”. We pay for our sins to be forgiven, but also for the licence to sin again. The trouble is that the technologies that might usher us into an age of cleaner flight aren’t at hand yet. The volume of biofuel and other alternatives being manufactured is vanishingly small. Graver’s team calculated in 2017 that all the world’s supply would keep the world’s planes in the air for a total of 10 minutes. (Environmental experts worry that biofuels, made out of products such as palm oil, will do more damage than they promise to repair.) If synthetic fuel becomes viable, it will cost more than $3 a gallon at first, Schäfer told me. “Oil is now around $1 a gallon. So why would airlines buy the synthetic stuff?” The battery that’s both small and powerful enough to take a plane across the Atlantic, or from Paris to Perth, is not even on the horizon. In the near term – a timescale that matters enormously to climate change – the only way to decarbonise aviation is to fly less. As an option, that seemed plumb absurd until this year, when we were forced to learn how to live without planes. In the coming years, airlines will be wrenched in two different directions. Their revenues will stay low and wobbly; Iata predicts that passenger numbers will return to pre-pandemic levels only by 2023, but others in the industry grimly cite 2024 or 2025. Simultaneously, many carriers will have to invest in climate change plans, buying offsets or funding research. Already, they’ve had to convince the ICAO to relax some Corsia obligations. In Europe, governments have imposed environmental reforms among the terms for airline bailouts. In return for €7bn, for instance, Air France has committed to halving domestic flight emissions by 2024 and to restricting short-haul flights where trains run instead. In the US, too, the government organised a $25bn aviation bailout, even though the four biggest airlines blew through nearly $40bn in cash over the last five years simply to buy back shares and prop up their stock prices. Here, there were no climate change riders. “Sustainability in the US is marginally more important than keeping enough toner in the fax machine,” Aboulafia told me. A Virgin Atlantic plane in flight in early 2020. Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA But airlines need passengers if they are to repay bailout loans, or mop up their emissions. In both the US and Europe, where growth was already slowing, the prompt and full return of customers isn’t at all a sure thing. This is especially true of business flyers. “Covid gives companies a reason to rethink travel expenses,” said Jeff Pelletier, who runs Airline Data, an analysis firm based in Dallas. Business travellers make up 12%-15% of a plane’s passengers, but they sit up front, so they contribute as much as 75% of a flight’s profits on some routes. “Not every company will cut back,” Pelletier said. “But some will. They’ll figure they’d rather spend a couple of bucks on a Zoom meeting instead.” In Asian countries including China and India – markets that have been growing faster than most others, as flights became increasingly affordable – Dennis Lau expects a quicker rebound. Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Cirium, told me that “climate change is not a part of the industry’s conversation here”. Corsia is, for many governments in the region, one more instance of western nations promoting environmental standards that they have violated for decades, and that will curb the economic development of Asian countries. China, India and Russia have agreed to participate in Corsia only from 2027 onwards. And there’s still considerable doubt about how thoroughly Corsia can be enforced, Lau said. “What will you do if countries just refuse to report their emissions?” During my reporting, I kept being told that eventually the pandemic’s effects would fade – that the world’s economy, having been opened wide by affordable flights, couldn’t be zipped shut again, and that people will get back on planes the second they believe it’s safe to fly again. But in the interim, a period of consolidation is in the offing. More airlines might go out of business, and others will be bought by bigger carriers. Airlines will have smaller fleets, Aboulafia wrote in a newsletter. More planes will be smaller, single-aisle jets flying point to point, because while the coronavirus still lurks, no one wants to spend a longer time than necessary in connecting flights or layover airports. Flying will feel both more austere, in these aseptic and functional flights, and more luxurious, since there will be less of it. The end of tourism? Read more In June, KLM’s engineers started to rouse some planes out of their hibernation. They replaced leaking toilet taps, fixed faulty rubber rings and tested the emergency lights. “The second-last thing we do is to check the fire extinguishing systems and the flight controls,” Ton Dortmans, KLM’s engineering chief, told me. “And then the last thing is: we run the engines and put all the systems on again to see if they work – air conditioning, navigation, all of it.” For a brief spell of time, uninhibited travel looked possible again, but then fresh bouts of disease appeared all over the continent. The week I was scheduled to visit KLM in Amsterdam, in mid-August, the UK government announced self-isolation rules for any traveller returning from the Netherlands, so my trip fell through. “You should have been here, to see what we were doing,” Dortmans lamented on our video call. He had been coming up with a fallback scenario for the winter. “It’s a question we have to answer now. If it’s a snowy, hard winter, maybe we have to rethink how our planes are parked here. You have to think about the water and the fuel in the planes, and how they react to freezing temperatures.” If his planes had to be parked for more than 180 days through the winter, Dortmans said, he would think about sending some away. Perhaps to Teruel, or perhaps to the boneyard in California’s Mojave desert, where they will be warmer and drier, and where they can wait to find out if they will be needed again. • This article was amended on 30 September 2020 and 6 October 2020.

They can help provide a new perspective to age-old problems. But maps are not necessarily fixed – they often need renewing. As Albert Einstein said, “You can’t use old maps to explore a new world.” While there are reasons to be uneasy about the future, maps can also inspire optimism. They not only reveal incredible progress, but also signal how a combination of political leadership, smart incentives and regulatory pressure can improve our human condition. Map-making is an ancient impulse. For tens of thousands of years, Homo sapiens has etched the nearest water source, herd of deer or unfriendly neighbours on cave walls, boulders and parchment. The oldest known world map, Imago Mundi, was drafted more than 2,500 years ago in Babylon (in present day Iraq). An even more influential global map was Geographia, produced by the Greek astronomer, geographer and mathematician Ptolemy in 150AD. While incomplete and inaccurate, such maps helped people start making sense of their surroundings. For much of human existence, most of the world was considered to be unknown and dangerous. This started to change after the Flemish cosmographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator developed a new mapping technique in the mid-1500s. Geographers such as James Gall in 1855 and Arno Peters in 1970 introduced modifications that fixed distortions (known as the Galls-Peters projection), but Mercator’s maps still adorn classrooms virtually everywhere.

Now another cartographical revolution is under way, with the advent of satellite imagery and our ability to superimpose data on to this two-dimensional view of the world. Now more than ever, maps can offer deeper insights, sudden revelations, clear signs of progress, or even potential answers to some of the gravest threats we face. Power play The climate crisis is the biggest challenge to our collective survival. Progress can be hard to glean – until you consider the quiet but inexorable rise of renewable energy. This map shows its rapid proliferation across the US over the past 35 years. It is possible that all 50 US states could move to 100% renewable grid energy by 2050. maps US energy transition – 1984-2020 Bridging digital divides Maps show how digital divides are shrinking. But they also reveal how some parts of the world are still digitally disconnected. In wealthy countries, more than 85% of the population has access to the internet, whereas the average for developing countries is 43%. Still, the growth in connectivity over the past generation has been remarkable and transformative. An estimated 75bn devices will be linked to every person, place and company by 2025. Getting connected is now an essential driver of economic growth. maps Share of population using the internet – 1990-2020 More educated than ever While Covid-19 is profoundly disrupting elementary, secondary and tertiary schooling around the world, humanity has come an extraordinarily long way in a very short period of time. As the map shows, most people living outside North America and western Europe had fewer than four years of education in 1950. maps Mean years of schooling – 1950-2020 Roughly 70 years later, the average duration of schooling has doubled. The number of children and adolescents out of school has also plummeted in recent decades. In the 1970, roughly 27% of primary-aged schoolchildren were out of school: today, it is closer to 8%. Just as impressive is the fact that most parts of the world are closing in on gender parity at the primary school level. These extraordinary gains have powered development and even helped democracies to flourish. Of course, not everyone is benefiting equally from the education revolution. At least 120m million children are still out of school. Another 250 million young people have yet to acquire basic skills in literacy and numeracy. There are still at least 750 million young people and adults who can not read or write. Children living longer Children aren’t just better educated – they are more likely to survive childhood than ever before. For most of our existence, newborns had even odds that they would live to five years of age. Human remains gathered from hunter-gatherer societies show mortality rates as high as 70%. As recently as the middle of the 19th century, one in two children died before they turned five. Today, a child dying before it reaches school age is a comparatively rare event – around 1 in 27 globally, compared with 1 in 11 in 1990. maps Child mortality under-5 – 1950-2020 While this is still unacceptably high, it is a remarkable improvement on the past. Life extensions Notwithstanding the many threats and challenges on the horizon, more people are living longer and healthier lives than at any time in history. Depending on where her parents live, a child born in 2000 can expect to live for at least 100 years. A wave of new research into gene editing and regenerative medicine is raising the possibility that human life could be extended by an order of magnitude longer. Of course, the principal reason people are living longer is because human health has improved. Better health is a result of remarkable advances in everything from medicine and lifestyles to quality of nutrition and care. One of the clearest indicators of improving human health is global life expectancy at birth. For most of the past 200,000 years, life was short, often brutally so. Most people did not live more than 25 years, and child mortality was off the chart. Then something extraordinary happened. Global life expectancy shot up in the 19th century and then doubled in the 20th century, the blink of the eye in evolutionary terms. Not everywhere has improved at the same pace: in Japan, people live on average to 85, while in the Central African Republic life expectancy is closer to 53. While these disparities are unacceptable, the prolongation of life is one of humanity’s greatest achievements. maps Life expectancy by country – 1960 and 2020 When confronted with these formidable problems, there is a danger that we succumb to pessimism and paralysis. That would be precisely the wrong thing to do. Maps can help remind us that solutions are to be found not by retreating from difficult challenges, but in closer collaboration to overcome our shared trials.

Early results from phase 3 trial look promising but there are still many questions to be answered Coronavirus – latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Nicola Davis Science correspondent @NicolaKSDavis Tue 10 Nov 2020 03.23 EST First published on Mon 9 Nov 2020 11.22 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Play Video 4:43 Is the new Covid vaccine our way back to normality? - video explainer What’s happened – is this a breakthrough? Pfizer and the German biotech company BioNTech said on Monday that they had had encouraging early results from a phase 3 clinical trial of their coronavirus vaccine. The trial is assessing how well the vaccine works in preventing humans from becoming infected. Although details are scant, the news is positive. What are the new results? Pfizer and BioNTech say they looked at 94 cases of coronavirus that occurred among participants after they had received two shots of either the vaccine or the placebo, and found that the vaccine was more than 90% effective at seven days after the second dose. As the two doses are spaced by three weeks, the team behind the vaccine say their results suggest protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination. Graphic They also found no signs of safety concerns, and stressed that the participants were from diverse backgrounds – an important consideration given that black and ethnic minority groups appear to be at greater risk from the virus. Regulators have previously said they would give the green light to a vaccine that has at least a 50% effectiveness rate, a bar this vaccine looks on course to exceed. How does this vaccine work? The vaccine in question is based on genetic material called mRNA that enables the production of the “spike proteins” that sit on the outside of the coronavirus. The vaccine introduces this mRNA to the human body, triggering human cells to produce the spike protein. In response to these proteins, the body produces antibodies, and other immune pathways are activated, guarding against infection. How excited should we be? Most experts agree that the results are exciting and excellent news, but the optimism should come with a note of caution: the results are preliminary, have been shared only by press release, and the trials are not yet complete. Covid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Read more So far, 38,955 people have received two doses of the vaccine, and the team plan a further analysis of the results once a total of 164 confirmed Covid-19 cases have occurred among the participants. They will also follow participants for two years post-vaccination to explore long-term safety and whether it continues to provide protection. There are certainly still many questions that need to be answered, including how long protection via the vaccine might last, whether it protects those who have previously had coronavirus, and whether it prevents people from catching the virus and passing it on or simply reduces the severity of symptoms. There are also logistical challenges, not least as the vaccine needs to be stored at -80C, meaning that even in developed countries there could be difficulties in distributing the jab. However, the results so far are very encouraging. What’s more, if successful, the vaccine would be the first licensed jab to be based on mRNA, a development that could fuel the emergence of new vaccines for other diseases. It would also set a record for the shortest time taken to develop an effective vaccine from scratch. How soon could it be available in the UK and globally? There is some way to go before the vaccine will be available, as it must be approved by licensing authorities. Pfizer has said it plans to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency approval as soon as safety data allows, possibly as soon as the third week of November. In the UK, Boris Johnson’s spokesman has said the UK has secured 40m doses of the vaccine, 10m of which are due to be available before the end of the year assuming no snags. But the logistical requirements mentioned above, such as cold storage, mean there could be problems rolling out the vaccine in countries with poorer health infrastructure or where electricity supply is unreliable, or in some rural areas. In addition, while demand has been anticipated, a huge level of production will be required, and then there is the matter of who gets the vaccine first and how mass vaccination would be rolled out. And what about the other vaccines – is Oxford far behind? There are more than 170 vaccines in development, 11 of which are in phase 3 efficacy trials – including an mRNA vaccine from the US company Moderna, and the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. The latter uses a different strategy to the Pfizer/BioNTech approach, delivering the gene for the spike protein to human cells via a chimpanzee cold virus that has been changed so it cannot grow and cause an infection. The results from this vaccine trial are expected in a matter of weeks.

Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters More than 1 billion people could be immunised against coronavirus by the end of next year with shots from the first two companies to reveal positive results, after the latest vaccine was shown in trials to have an efficacy of nearly 95% . With the US’s top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, hailing “the light at the end of the tunnel”, the US biotech firm Moderna announced impressive results for its mRNA vaccine on Monday, a week after interim results for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed 90% efficacy. The inclusion of high-risk and elderly people in the Moderna trial suggested the vaccine would protect those most vulnerable to the disease, said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, who described the results as “tremendously exciting”. Though it is more expensive, Moderna’s vaccine could potentially provide a major advantage over Pfizer’s, which requires ultracold freezing between -70C (-94F) and -80C from production facility to patient. Moderna said it had improved the shelf life and stability, meaning its vaccine can be stored for six months at -20C for shipping and long-term storage, and at standard refrigeration temperatures of 2C to 8C for 30 days. Moderna said it could potentially manufacture 1bn doses by the end of 2021, adding to a further 1.3bn from Pfizer/BioNTech in the same timeframe. Both vaccines require two doses and are due to be assessed by regulators in coming weeks. Speaking at a press briefing, Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which co-developed the vaccine, lauded the Moderna jab and others still in trials. He urged people to continue to observe guidelines to combat the disease. “We should not let the accomplishment of an effective vaccine have us feel we can let our guard down … In fact, it should be an incentive to double down as we then ultimately have the synergy between a vaccine and a public health measure which will get us out of the very difficult situation.” Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said: “This has been incredible teamwork. I think none of us probably thought that we could get to this place in the last 10 months.” Moderna’s interim analysis, based on the first 95 patients with confirmed Covid infections, found the candidate vaccine had an efficacy of 94.5%. The company said it planned to apply to the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for emergency use authorisation in the coming weeks. In the analysis, 90 of the patients had received the placebo with the remaining five getting the vaccine. Here are the major hurdles ahead for Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the US Read more Though provisional, the results are particularly exciting because the trial included a large proportion of people at high risk of severe Covid-19 and these appear to have been well protected. The Moderna vaccine, which is being trialled in more than 30,000 volunteers, is not expected to be available outside the US until next year. The biotech company said it would have 20m doses ready to ship in the US before the end of 2020 and hoped to manufacture 500m to 1bn doses globally next year. Guardian graphic Moderna has agreed to provide the US with 100m doses, with an option to buy 400m more. Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and Israel have also signed agreements, and the European commission has a “potential purchase agreement” for 80m-160m doses. The vaccine, which is based on similar mRNA technology to BioNTech’s, is expected to be assessed by the FDA on a final analysis of 151 Covid cases among trial participants who will be followed on average for more than two months. Doses At £38 to £45 for a course of two shots, Moderna’s vaccine is more expensive than the other frontrunners. AstraZeneca and Oxford University are aiming to sell their vaccine at about £3 a dose, while vaccines in trial with Johnson & Johnson and a collaboration between Sanofi and GSK are both expected to cost about £8 a dose. Pfizer is charging the US about £30 for a two-shot course. Moderna’s two-shot vaccine injects genetic material called mRNA into the body, which cells then use to churn out the spike protein the virus uses to invade cells. The spike protein covers the surface of the virus and is one of the main targets of the body’s immune response to wipe out the infection. Covid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Read more There is some statistical uncertainty over the 94.5% figure but Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that based on the numbers released, the efficacy was still likely to be better than 85%. A question mark remains over whether the Pfizer vaccine prevents serious illness. The Moderna results, released by an independent data safety monitoring board, are encouraging on this point. Of 11 participants who developed severe Covid while on the trial, all were in the placebo group. The results also suggest the vaccine is effective in older people and those from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Moderna said about 42% of participants were at risk of severe Covid-19 if infected, as they were older or had co-morbidities such as diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure. Moderna’s interim analysis found no significant safety concerns, with most reactions being mild to moderate and short lived. Among the side-effects reported were injection site pain in 2.7% of trial volunteers after the first jab. After the second, the most significant side-effects included fatigue in 9.7%, muscle pain in 9% and joint pain in 5%. Others had headaches, other pains, or redness at the injection site. • This article was amended on 17 November 2020 to clarify that results of vaccine trials at this stage refer to “efficacy” – the performance of an intervention under ideal and controlled circumstances – not “effectiveness”, which describes performance under real-world conditions.

Photograph: Iván Alvarado/Reuters The race is on to find a steady source of lithium, a key component in rechargeable electric car batteries. But while the EU focuses on emissions, the lithium gold rush threatens environmental damage on an industrial scale by Oliver Balch Main image: Brine pools and processing areas of the Rockwood lithium plant on the Atacama salt flat, Chile. Photograph: Iván Alvarado/Reuters Tue 8 Dec 2020 01.00 EST Last modified on Wed 9 Dec 2020 05.52 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Even before the new mine became the main topic of village conversation, João Cassote, a 44-year-old livestock farmer, was thinking about making a change. Living off the land in his mountainous part of northern Portugal was a grind. Of his close childhood friends, he was the only one who hadn’t gone overseas in search of work. So, in 2017, when he heard of a British company prospecting for lithium in the region of Trás-os-Montes, Cassote called his bank and asked for a €200,000 loan. He bought a John Deere tractor, an earthmover and a portable water-storage tank. The exploration team of the UK-based mining company Savannah Resources had spent months poring over geological maps and surveys of the hills that ripple out from Cassote’s farm. Initial calculations indicated that they could contain more than 280,000 tonnes of lithium, a silver-white alkali metal – enough for 10 years’ production. Cassote got in touch with Savannah’s local office, and the mining firm duly contracted him to supply water to their test drilling site. The return on his investment was swift. After less than 12 months on the company’s books, Cassote had made what he would usually earn in five or six years on the farm. Savannah is just one of several mining companies with an eye on the rich lithium deposits of central and northern Portugal. The sudden excitement surrounding petróleo branco (“white oil”) derives from an invention rarely seen in these parts: the electric car. Lithium is a key active material in the rechargeable batteries that run electric cars. It is found in rock and clay deposits as a solid mineral, as well as dissolved in brine. It is popular with battery manufacturers because, as the least dense metal, it stores a lot of energy for its weight. Electrifying transport has become a top priority in the move to a lower-carbon future. In Europe, car travel accounts for around 12% of all the continent’s carbon emissions. To keep in line with the Paris agreement, emissions from cars and vans will need to drop by more than a third (37.5%) by 2030. The EU has set an ambitious goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the same date. To that end, Brussels and individual member states are pouring millions of euros into incentivising car owners to switch to electric. Some countries are going even further, proposing to ban sales of diesel and petrol vehicles in the near future (as early as 2025 in the case of Norway). If all goes to plan, European electric vehicle ownership could jump from around 2m today to 40m by 2030. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It is predicted that there will be 40m electric cars in Europe by 2030. Photograph: Ben Margot/AP Lithium is key to this energy transition. Lithium-ion batteries are used to power electric cars, as well as to store grid-scale electricity. (They are also used in smartphones and laptops.) But Europe has a problem. At present, almost every ounce of battery-grade lithium is imported. More than half (55%) of global lithium production last year originated in just one country: Australia. Other principal suppliers, such as Chile (23%), China (10%) and Argentina (8%), are equally far-flung. Lithium deposits have been discovered in Austria, Serbia and Finland, but it is in Portugal that Europe’s largest lithium hopes lie. The Portuguese government is preparing to offer licences for lithium mining to international companies in a bid to exploit its “white oil” reserves. Sourcing lithium in its own back yard not only offers Europe simpler logistics and lower prices, but fewer transport-related emissions. It also promises Europe security of supply – an issue given greater urgency by the coronavirus pandemic’s disruption of global trade. Even before the pandemic, alarm was mounting about sourcing lithium. Dr Thea Riofrancos, a political economist at Providence College in Rhode Island, pointed to growing trade protectionism and the recent US-China trade spat. (And that was before the trade row between China and Australia.) Whatever worries EU policymakers might have had before the pandemic, she said, “now they must be a million times higher”. The urgency in getting a lithium supply has unleashed a mining boom, and the race for “white oil” threatens to cause damage to the natural environment wherever it is found. But because they are helping to drive down emissions, the mining companies have EU environmental policy on their side. “There’s a fundamental question behind all this about the model of consumption and production that we now have, which is simply not sustainable,” said Riofrancos. “Everyone having an electric vehicle means an enormous amount of mining, refining and all the polluting activities that come with it.” In the tiny hamlet of Muro in Trás-os-Montes, Cassote has concerns of his own. The prospecting phase ended earlier this year, and his expensive new machinery is standing idle in his farmyard. Savannah is waiting for the final green light from the Portuguese government for its lithium mine. If approved, the company is promising to invest $109m in the project. It will also create a quarry like an open wound in the mountainside. Cassote doesn’t mind. He just wants to be back on his earthmover. Not everyone shares Cassote’s enthusiasm for lithium mining. After three decades living in Amsterdam, Mario Inacio, a 50-year-old professional dancer, recently returned to his home in Portugal with plans to build a yoga retreat deep in the countryside – somewhere bucolic and isolated where guests could wake to the sound of birdsong. Inacio and his partner, Milko Prinsze, had identified the perfect spot, an abandoned farmstead set in 47 acres of grassy wilderness in central Portugal. The main house would require considerable renovation, but the rest was exactly as they had imagined. Driving down the sinuous, bumpy driveway for the first time, Inacio dreamed of the changes they could make – extending the house off to the side, converting the outhouses into private living quarters, carving out a natural pool in the rocks. He pinpointed the spot for the yoga studio: a small rise with expansive views over the grounds and out to the hills beyond. Six years after the couple first set eyes on the place, Quinta Da Lua Nova is now ready to open its doors to paying guests. The global pandemic is creating a shortage of international clients and making it difficult to fill the nine rooms, but a much greater worry hangs over the business in which Inacio has invested his life savings. Moving to one of the large ground-floor windows of his new home, he pointed to the lush expanse of open country outside. “Any of this could be exploited for lithium soon. Possible exploration orders hang over all of it.” In the past few years, small groups of anxious residents have come together across Portugal, concerned about the government’s lithium plans. With few facts in the public domain, these groups started making inquiries to local planning departments and town halls. In Inacio’s case, he said that he was told his requests would be “passed on”. He never heard any more. At the same time, early-stage exploration works, led by the likes of Savannah and the Portugal-based Lusorecursos, were reportedly sighted across the country. An objector unearthed a technical assessment of Portugal’s lithium resources commissioned by the energy ministry in 2016. Eventually, a government spokesperson confirmed that discussions were under way with various mining companies, but said no firm decisions had yet been made. Facebook Twitter Pinterest João Cassote near the site of a proposed lithium mine in northern Portugal. Photograph: Oliver Balch Then, in January 2020, a map began circulating among the various WhatsApp and Facebook groups set up by concerned residents like Inacio. The map, put together by a local software developer specialising in cartography, appeared to confirm their worst fears. A tapestry of geometric shapes spread across the country’s interior, abutting designated nature reserves. A series of local and national protests, including a march in Lisbon last year, sought to raise awareness about the impacts of modern mining on the natural environment, including potential industrial-scale habitat destruction, chemical contamination and noise pollution, as well as high levels of water consumption. They also raised concerns about the impact on tourism – an economic mainstay for the country’s interior, with an annual turnover of €18.4bn in 2019. All these concerns appear in a “national manifesto” recently published by a coalition of civic movements. Despite vociferous local media coverage, they have made little impact so far. In part, this reflects the relative weakness of the national environmental movement. Portugal is one of the few countries in Europe not to have a Greenpeace affiliate, for instance, and according to an EU survey, of all European consumers, the Portuguese are the least likely to pay more for eco-branded products. For Maria Carmo, a 43-year-old university lecturer from the village of Barco, in the central district of Castelo Branco, such lack of engagement reveals the alienation that most urban or coastal-dwelling Portuguese feel towards the country’s rural heartlands. The trend in the past 50 years or so has been one of continued rural depopulation. Hundreds of thousands of people have left Portugal’s poor and already under-populated interior for new lives abroad or in the country’s coastal cities. Few of them return. If a mining licence is granted in their region, Inacio and a small core of diehard supporters are prepared to fight it in the courts. Carmo is less sure. Her campaign group in Castelo Branco has already split, with half its members now open to the possibility of an open-pit lithium mine above her village. It will happen anyway, they say, so why not negotiate some guarantees? Barco used to have a tin mine, the villagers argue, and it wasn’t so bad. But Carmo feels it’s a mistake to compare the two operations. Her own father and grandfather both worked in the Argemela tin mine outside the village before it closed in the early 1960s. Back then, mining was small-scale and subterranean. A new mine, in contrast, could see half the hill disappear, potentially damaging the remains of a bronze-age settlement on its peak. Villagers also fear that chemical runoff will pollute the nearby Zêzere river, which they depend on for their crops. After a three-year struggle, Carmo is exhausted and ready to give in. She feels the government is deaf, and that her fellow citizens aren’t interested. “So much destruction,” she said. “And for what? So eco-minded urbanites in Paris and Berlin can feel good about driving around in zero-emission cars.” Advocates of Portugal’s hoped-for lithium boom argue that local disruption is a small price to pay for tackling the climate crisis. They point out that innovations such as windfarms, solar energy parks and hydroelectric plants, while contributing to lowering CO2 emissions in the long term, all have some impact on local populations. In a note to investors, Savannah observes that its proposed mine (which boasts projected revenues of US$1.55bn over its initial 11-year lifespan) will contribute to enough battery packs to prevent the emission of 100m tonnes of carbon dioxide. Savannah’s chief executive, David Archer, goes even further. Speaking from his London office, he pitched his firm’s multimillion-dollar investment as advancing the overall “quality of the global commons”. The equation he offers is simple: lithium equals batteries, which equals electric cars, which equals an end to transport emissions, which equals a world less vulnerable to today’s climate emergency. He adds the prospect of new jobs in the local area (up to 800 in Trás-os-Montes), higher tax revenues and a €437m boost to Portugal’s economy. From a development perspective, he said, it’s a “no-brainer”. The Portuguese government concurs. In a promotional video targeted at foreign investors, the secretary of state for the environment named his country “one of the world’s leaders in energy transition”. The short film stresses the current government’s “strong commitment” to a policy of eco-innovation. Objectors say that where there is profit to be made, local environmental impacts are almost always overlooked. The same dilemma has set back international climate talks for decades, said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead for the campaign group ActionAid. The global north wants stricter emissions targets; the global south wants economic development now, and reasonably feels that the burden of tackling the climate crisis should fall on the post-industrial societies primarily responsible for causing it. “Green technologies are essential for the transition to renewable energy,” Singh said, “but they are not without negative impacts [and] we need to ensure these don’t always fall on the poorest and most marginalised communities.” Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning In Chile, the battle over the impact of mining has been going on for years. Born and brought up in the copper-producing region of O’Higgins in central Chile, community activist Ramón Balcázar, now 36, became aware of the potential damage of large-scale mining at an early age. Long-running disputes – over land use, water rights and chemical contamination – provided the background to his youth in the 90s. Then, six years ago, he moved to the northern outpost of San Pedro de Atacama. On the lip of the country’s famed Andean salt flats, the town looks out to a coarse, sun-baked carpet of crystalline whites and smudgy grey. There, under this huge, cloudless desert sky, Balcázar finally felt able to breathe freely. He did not know it, but he had walked into another battle zone. San Pedro lies on the westernmost point of a mining area that spreads north across the Atacama desert to Bolivia and west into Argentina. Fifty times drier than California’s Death valley, the area’s parched surface conceals an underworld rich in minerals. Historically, mining companies have exploited its lucrative deposits of copper and, to a lesser extent, iodine and nitrates. By some estimates, it also contains as much as half the world’s lithium reserves. In the early to mid-2010s, when talk of lithium-ion batteries began circulating in every mining town, a raft of new licences were requested, investments made, and extraction facilities expanded. The area became known as the “lithium triangle”. The mining companies insist their operations are sustainable. Balcázar, speaking from Mexico City, where he is studying for a graduate research degree, said they have no evidence for this claim. No one knows what effects lithium extraction on such a large scale will have on the Atacama’s fragile natural ecosystem. Unlike in Portugal, lithium here is found in brine, so the mining operations use no dynamite and no earthmovers, and threaten to leave no unsightly craters. Instead, they consist of a series of large, neatly segregated evaporation pools filled with millions of litres of brine that have been pumped from below the surface and left to evaporate in the sun. The fears of residents like Balcázar are focused on the area’s cavernous, subterranean aquifers, from where the brine is pumped. Here, they maintain, a disaster is unfolding. There is a risk that the reserves of clean water, which are found in a separate layer above the brine deposits, may become contaminated. Balcázar has been working with the Plurinational Observatory of Andean Salt Flats, a network of expert scientists and concerned citizens, to chart changes to the local ecology. The weight of their evidence – shrinking pasturelands, failing crops, disappearing flora and fauna – all point towards a process of desertification which they believe is exacerbated by lithium extraction. The impact of disturbing a “huge, complex hydrological system” is not visible from one day to the next, said Balcázar. “But the two are interlinked, without any doubt.” Plans by lithium mining firm SQM to expand its operations were recently blocked by a Chilean court on environmental grounds, but almost every other effort to get the backing of the authorities has failed. In Chile, Balcázar said, certain territories and natural environments have always been “sacrificeable” in the name of progress. While mining firms scour the world’s deserts and countryside for lithium concentrate, a parallel search is on to find ways of producing battery-grade lithium without sending in the diggers. On an industrial estate surrounded by fields in rural Saxony, Christian Hanisch set out to discover a solution in recycling. “What if, instead of extracting virgin lithium from the ground, we use what we already have?” he said. Half a million tonnes of lithium has been extracted and refined in the past decade, much of which now sits in discarded mobile phones and laptops approaching obsolescence. In his modest first-floor office at Duesenfeld, the company he co-founded while working on his PhD at Braunschweig University of Technology, Hanisch, 37, admitted that the logistics are challenging. The lithium-ion batteries in everyday devices are typically small and fiddly, so to make his venture viable, Hanisch decided to start big, with used electric car batteries (which each contain about 8kg of reusable lithium). He pointed out of the window, where several recently delivered samples were piled up on the tarmac outside the factory next door, each the size of a chunky mattress. Removing the battery’s heavy plastic casing is easy enough; the challenge is how to access the lithium inside the battery cell itself. Currently, two main options exist: either heat the components to about 300C to evaporate the lithium, or apply acids and other reducing agents to leach it. Both approaches are complicated by lithium’s extreme volatility (it is prone to exploding) and its amalgamation with other metals (which are added in for better conductivity). With market analysts predicting a potential 12-fold increase in the value of the global lithium recycling industry over next decade, to more than $18bn by 2030, competition among recycling innovators is hotting up. In Germany alone, Duesenfeld faces competition from at least three other early-stage lithium recyclers. Across the border in Belgium, a former smelting firm turned urban waste recycler, Umicore, is developing its own technology, but releasing no details. Another significant European player is Snam, in France. Hanisch is confident that his procedure has an edge. Rather than smelting (which is highly energy intensive) or leaching (extremely toxic), Duesenfeld’s approach is based on mechanical separation. This method involves physically breaking the battery down into its component parts and then extracting the residual lithium via a combination of magnetisation and distillation. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A lithium ion battery from a Mercedes S-Class hybrid. Photograph: Alamy In the company’s factory, amid a cacophony of whirring and clanking, a submarine-like cylindrical contraption (“that’s the crusher”, shouted Hanisch through the ear protectors clamped to my head) occupies the back wall. Filling the space between is a jungle of pipes, funnels and conveyor belts punctuated by worktops. Quite where the production line begins or ends is unclear. Hanisch regarded his invention with a blissful expression. “It’s noisy,” he conceded, “But it’s the greenest way of recycling lithium there is.” Hanisch was brought up in a farming family in rural Lower Saxony, a background that inspired his environmental ambitions. Earlier this year he launched a consultancy venture, No Canary, advising on low-carbon methods for producing not just a battery, but an entire electric vehicle, from the materials stage through to final disposal. “Greta [Thunberg] was right”, he told listeners to his inaugural webinar. “We aren’t moving nearly fast enough on decarbonisation.” Shifting away from petrol and diesel is not the only concern. Manufacturing any car, electric or otherwise, causes carbon emissions, be it from the coal used to smelt the steel for its body work or the diesel oil burned when shipping its electronic components across oceans. The extra materials and energy involved in manufacturing a lithium-ion battery mean that, at present, the carbon emissions associated with producing an electric car are higher than those for a vehicle running on petrol or diesel – by as much as 38%, according to some calculations. Until the electricity in national grids is entirely renewable, recharging the battery will involve a degree of dependence on coal or gas-fired power stations. Lithium accounts for a small part of the battery’s cost, which means there is less incentive for manufacturers to find an alternative. As it is, recycling lithium costs more than digging it out of the ground. For Hanisch, one of the chief costs comes at the end of the process: converting the recovered lithium from its recycled state (lithium sulphate) into a battery-ready form (lithium carbonate). Without the resources to build his own chemical plant, Duesenfeld sends his end product – a grainy composite of precious metals known as “black mass” – to a hydrometallurgical facility for final processing. For existing recycling plants, lithium is not where the money lies, said Linda Gaines, an expert in battery recycling systems at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. As she said: “The main purpose is to recover the cobalt, as well as nickel and copper. The lithium doesn’t add much.” As with wind turbines and solar panels, the price of recycled lithium will very likely come down as battery manufacturers scale up. Supposing this proves true, there’s a huge supply-demand imbalance to get over. Before the pandemic, total sales of electric vehicles were projected to more than quadruple in the next five years, to more than 11m units. Demand for lithium will rise accordingly, with one industry estimate suggesting annual consumption could easily reach 700,000 tonnes by the middle of this decade. So, even if Duesenfeld and its competitors were able to recycle every last ounce of lithium produced in the last decade, come 2025, it would only be enough to power new electric vehicle batteries for nine months. As it turns out, the recession caused by the pandemic may have granted campaigners a reprieve, halting the immediate need to open new lithium mines. With the world facing a prolonged crisis, new cars – even eco-friendly ones – are not at the top of most people’s priorities. As manufacture has slowed down, a glut of lithium on global markets has dampened the white oil boom, if only temporarily. But investors remain bullish about lithium’s long-term prospects. With a change of regime in the White House, there is hope for renewed support for measures to tackle the climate crisis. In the fortnight after the US election, the stock price of Chile-based lithium mine company Albermarle rose by more than 20%. In the UK, Boris Johnson’s announcement about bringing forward a ban on new diesel and petrol cars to 2030 gave the market a boost. The European commission still wants a lithium industry to call its own. In September, the Slovak diplomat and a commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič publicly endorsed Portugal’s plans as “necessary” for the automotive sector. What’s more, the European Investment Bank would be on hand to help, he promised. His comment chimed with the launch of a new EU strategy on raw materials, which, among other goals, seeks to increase Europe’s lithium supply 18-fold by 2030, while reducing Europe’s dependence on third-party countries. This is discouraging for the opponents of lithium mines in Portugal, but Šefčovič offered them a crumb of comfort. The decision to mine has to be taken in dialogue “with local communities”, he asserted, adding that “we need to assure these communities that these projects are not only of the greatest importance, but will also benefit the region and the country”. The modern corporate responsibility movement is built on such logic. First, it does not promise to eliminate all negative industrial impacts. Instead, it pledges to “manage” them, and then to balance out any damage with compensatory “benefits”, to use Šefčovič’s phrase. In the case of Savannah’s mine in northern Portugal, the company concedes there will be local environmental impact, but argues that it will be outweighed by the upsides (inward investment, jobs, community projects). Facebook Twitter Pinterest A sample of lithium carbonate processed from the Rockwood mine in Chile. Photograph: Ivan Alvarado/Reuters Godofredo Pereira, a Portuguese environmental architect based at the Royal College of Art in London, is sceptical. His first-hand observations of the exploitation of Chile’s salt flats suggest that offers of dialogue can be superficial. Even in Atacama, where international accords give indigenous groups the right to “free, prior, informed consent”, detractors such as Balcázar struggle to be heard. Instead, the view of pro-mining community groups is taken as universal. If necessary, the obligation to gain consent can be weakened simply by defining lithium as a mineral of “strategic” or “critical” national value – which is easy enough, given lithium’s contribution to slowing global heating and cleaner air. Nor, very often, do the promised trade-offs turn out to be quite what they initially seem, according to Pereira. The voluntary nature of corporate responsibility means mining firms can backtrack if it suits them. Even when local groups succeed in negotiating a fixed royalty (3.5% of sales, in the case of one major extractor in Atacama), communities frequently split in the subsequent fight for the spoils. Digging up Portugal’s mountains in the name of green technology may still be avoidable. An alternative, less controversial technology could break on to the scene. Green hydrogen, for instance, could help offset up to 10% of Europe’s emissions. A more immediate solution would be to rethink how we get around. As Thea Riofrancos at Providence College pointed out, if everyone were to adopt “rational forms of transport” – such as trains, trams, e-buses, cycling and car-sharing – then demand for passenger vehicles of all kinds would shrink overnight. For Portugal’s anti-mining groups, however, the clock is ticking. Godofredo argued that citizens must demand a dialogue, in order to “get a conversation going about what model of development we want”. If people were better informed, he reasoned, it’s just possible that public opinion could swing to their side, and the country’s lithium mining plans could get shelved. In this regard, recent demands by Portugal’s Green party for a national impact evaluation of mining policy is promising. Portugal’s protesters can see that blocking green growth won’t get them far. These interior regions need investment. Hence the banner hanging from the playground fence in João Cassote’s neighbouring village, which reads “Sim à Vida” (Yes to life) beside “Não à Mina” (No to the Mine). “Life” for opponents of the mine, including Mario Inacio and Maria Carmo, is eco-tourism, regenerative farming, local supply chains, and other tenets of low-carbon living. For Cassote, it means a decent wage for a decent day’s work. For a green future, it’s going to be vital to accommodate both visions. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.

Photograph: Denis Lovrović/AFP via Getty Images Sun 31 Jan 2021 01.00 EST Last modified on Sun 31 Jan 2021 05.44 EST The European commission’s U-turn over its reckless plan to effectively blockade the Ireland-Northern Ireland border is the latest humiliation suffered by Brussels amid an escalating firestorm sparked by Covid-19 vaccine supply shortages across Europe. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has made a series of mistakes and misjudgments in handling the pandemic over the past year. This latest blunder will intensify doubts about her leadership. It is extraordinary that Von der Leyen and senior colleagues did not appear to appreciate how unwise, and potentially dangerous for the Belfast-Good Friday agreement, was their move to impose back-door vaccine import controls on the UK using Brexit’s Northern Ireland protocol. This had to be personally spelled out to her by Boris Johnson and the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin. Both expressed “deep unhappiness” – code for utter fury and amazement. The shambles in Brussels did not begin with this row, nor is Von der Leyen the only culprit. A palpable sense of panic has gripped EU leaders in recent days as public anger has understandably grown over Europe-wide vaccine shortfalls. In France, Spain and elsewhere, vaccination schedules are in turmoil. People in the most vulnerable groups are being turned away. As demands for an explanation rise, political blame-shifting has reached a new level. AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, has emerged as the scapegoat of choice for European politicians and bureaucrats anxious to avoid taking responsibility. Its outstanding success, sparked by a brilliant team of scientists and researchers at Oxford University, in producing a highly effective, easily administered, at-cost vaccine seems too much to stomach for the likes of Emmanuel Macron, France’s president. In remarkably ill-informed comments, Macron regurgitated erroneous German claims France has, sadly, failed to produce its own vaccine. Last week, the celebrated Pasteur Institute abandoned its main vaccine project, while the French pharma group, Sanofi, also admitted temporary defeat. French leaders have taken this hard. “It’s a sign of the decline of the country,” said Macron ally François Bayrou. He blamed the United States for a French “brain drain”. Macron took aim elsewhere. In remarkably ill-informed comments on Friday, he regurgitated erroneous German claims that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in use in the UK was “ineffective” among people aged over 65. He also suggested, again without evidence, that the company, and the UK government, had engaged in “questionable behaviour”. It’s no surprise that a French leader, down in the polls ahead of elections next year and feeling the heat, should unfairly pick on Britain. Less expected have been unhelpful interventions by other European politicians, notably German health minister, Jens Spahn. While Spahn amplified doubts about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, others were complaining, perversely, about supply cuts – all as the European regulator dithered over approving its use, which it finally did on Friday. Low-quality European leadership has been a problem since the start of the pandemic. The commission belatedly realised last spring that it was in a global vaccine race, not least with Donald Trump. It allowed four countries – Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands – to lead negotiations with possible suppliers. Then in June, Von der Leyen and her equally unimpressive health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, fatefully changed their minds. For political, not scientific reasons, the commission opted to involve all 27 members in vaccine acquisition For political, not scientific or practical reasons, they opted to involve all 27 member states in vaccine acquisition decision-making, with the commission in overall charge – in order to demonstrate EU “solidarity” and the power of the single market. This led to an EU contract with AstraZeneca, ready for signature in June, being delayed until August. Other vaccine pre-orders were also held up. The US company Moderna warned in November that this approach would inevitably slow vaccine delivery across the EU. The EU claim that AstraZeneca failed to honour its contractual obligations – the issue that has led it, against World Health Organization (WHO) advice, to introduce blanket controls on vaccine exports – must be seen in this context: panicky leadership in Brussels, national blame-games, bureaucratic and regulatory tardiness, post-Brexit anti-British animus and no-fault production problems, such as those experienced by Pfizer as well as AstraZeneca’s Belgian and Dutch plants. The WHO warns that Europe’s vaccine controls will prolong the global pandemic. The vaccine crisis has shown the EU at its worst. By contrast, it has shown Britain at its best. Early government purchasing decisions were crucial. The rollout, overseen by Kate Bingham’s taskforce, has been efficiently managed so far by a grand coalition of NHS workers, GPs’ surgeries, pharmacies and volunteers. Now comes new data suggesting vaccinations are having a real impact in reducing infections and slowing the pandemic. Immunity is said to continue to build a month after a single dose is administered. As of Friday, more than 11% of the UK population had been vaccinated compared with 2.3% in Germany and 1.8% in France. These figures give a stark measure of relative EU incapacity. At the end of a week that saw a grim milestone of 100,000 Covid deaths in Britain, the UK’s vaccine success story is a bright star in a gloomy firmament. Incompetence in Brussels must by no means be allowed to obstruct this encouraging progress. As for the EU, it should get its house in order – quickly.

Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP Lauren Aratani Sat 27 Feb 2021 03.00 EST Last modified on Sat 27 Feb 2021 03.03 EST It’s not just the value of bitcoin that has soared in the last year – so has the huge amount of energy it consumes. The cryptocurrency’s value has dipped recently after passing a high of $50,000 but the energy used to create it has continued to soar during its epic rise, climbing to the equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use. Recent interest from major Wall Street institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs probably culminated in the currency’s rise in value and an endorsement by Tesla’s Elon Musk helped drive its recent high as investors bet the cryptocurrency will become more widely embraced in the near future. interactive While the recent fall has dented Musk’s fortune, bitcoin also poses a threat to the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future” and poses serious questions for governments and corporations looking to curb their own carbon footprints. Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process. “Mining” bitcoin involves solving complex math problems in order to create new bitcoins. Miners are rewarded in bitcoin. Earlier in bitcoin’s relatively short history – the currency was created in 2009 – one could mine bitcoin on an average computer. But the way bitcoin mining has been set up by its creator (or creators – no one really knows for sure who created it) is that there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined: 21m. The more bitcoin that is mined, the harder the algorithms that must be solved to get a bitcoin become. Now that over 18.5m bitcoin have been mined, the average computer can no longer mine bitcoins. Instead, mining now requires special computer equipment that can handle the intense processing power needed to get bitcoin today. And, of course, these special computers need a lot of electricity to run. The amount of electricity used to mine bitcoin “has historically been more than [electricity used by] entire countries, like Ireland”, said Benjamin Jones, a professor of economics at the University of New Mexico who has researched bitcoin’s environmental impact. “We’re talking about multiple terawatts, dozens of terawatts a year of electricity being used just for bitcoin … That’s a lot of electricity.” Proponents of bitcoin say that mining is increasingly being done with electricity from renewable sources as that type of energy becomes cheaper, and the energy used is far lower than that of other, more wasteful, uses of power. The energy wasted by plugged-in but inactive home devices in the US alone could power bitcoin mining for 1.8 years, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. But environmentalists say that mining is still a cause for concern particularly because miners will go wherever electricity is cheapest and that may mean places that use coal. According to Cambridge, China has the most bitcoin mining of any country by far. While the country has been slowly moving toward renewable energy, about two-thirds of its electricity comes from coal. Since there is no government body or organization that officially tracks where bitcoin is being mined and what type of electricity miners are using, there is no way of knowing whether miners are using electricity that is fueled by renewable energy or fossil fuels. Mining rigs can move from place to place depending on where energy is cheapest, which makes mining particularly hard to track. “The places where you mine [bitcoin] can be moved around and, in some cases, you don’t even know where they are,” said Camilo Mora, a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii. Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finances estimates that bitcoin’s annualised electricity consumption hovers just above 115 terawatt-hours (TWh) while Digiconomist’s closely tracked index puts it closer to 80 TWh. A single transaction of bitcoin has the same carbon footprint as 680,000 Visa transactions or 51,210 hours of watching YouTube, according to the site. A paper from 2018 from the Oak Ridge Institute in Ohio found that one dollar’s worth of bitcoin took 17 megajoules of energy, more than double the amount of energy it took to mine one dollar’s worth of copper, gold and platinum. Another study from the UK published last year said that computer power required to mine Bitcoin quadrupled in 2019 compared with the year before, and that mining has had an influence in prices in some power and utility markets. Bitcoin’s advocates have made it clear that they believe any environmental costs that come with mining bitcoin are worth the broader impacts it could have on society. 05:59 Why Bitcoin is so bad for the planet – video explainer “Bitcoin would not be able to fulfill its role as a secure, global value transfer and storage system without being costly to maintain,” reads a defense against bitcoin criticism from Ria Bhutoria, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets. “Computers and smartphones have much larger carbon footprints than typewriters and telegraphs. Sometimes a technology is so revolutionary and important for humanity that society accepts the tradeoffs,” wrote investor Tyler Winklevoss on Twitter. Some have pointed out that there does not have to be a tradeoff between cryptocurrency and the environment. The creators of ethereum, considered the second most popular type of cryptocurrency after bitcoin, have promised to change the currency’s algorithm to make its mining more environmentally friendly. Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist who invited ethereum, told IEEE Spectrum that mining cryptocurrency can be “a huge waste of resources, even if you don’t believe that pollution and carbon dioxide are an issue”, Buterin said. “There are real consumers – real people – whose need for electricity is being displaced by this stuff.” Currently, ethereum’s mining works similarly to bitcoin where the most powerful computers have an edge in getting the most bitcoin as computers compete to complete a transaction first. Ethereum’s developers are working on changing that system so that miners enter a pool and are randomly selected to complete the transaction and receive an ether in return. This method, called “proof-of-stake”, guarantees that less electricity will be used to mine the currency. But with bitcoin still reigning as the top cryptocurrency and, with endorsements from established companies and investment banks, the currency’s environmental impact is only likely to grow. When it comes to electricity, “the computer doesn’t care. The computer is just getting the electricity to run, but where its electricity comes from makes a huge difference [for the environment],” said Mora.

Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Bitcoin hit $50,547 on Tuesday but there are still many sceptics. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Phillip Inman @phillipinman Tue 16 Feb 2021 23.53 EST First published on Tue 16 Feb 2021 09.07 EST Bitcoin soared through the key $50,000 level on Tuesday for the first time as the growing acceptance of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency among large banks and investment funds continued to draw in mainstream investors. After a meteoric rise in which its value increased by 75% since the start of the year, the currency hit $50,547.70 (£36,320) per coin in European trading at around 12.35 GMT. The price surge means Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla has piled up a virtual profit of $420m in the week since the entrepreneur said the business had bought bitcoins then worth $1.5bn. At the time of the announcement, on 8 February, bitcoin was trading at $39,406. Only last March, bitcoin was trading at below $6,000 and in 2016 a single coin was worth less than $400. Analysts said the increase was a combination of endorsements from prominent business people, including Musk, and several investment banks that have said they would buy the currency. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said bitcoin’s longer-term prospects depended on whether more people embraced the cryptocurrency. “The more people that adapt it and use it as money, the greater the chances of it perhaps being taken on board as a mainstream currency,” he said. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, reckons some investors will be taking profits, as the $50k milestone had been seen as a key target. Once the profit taking is over, it could soar towards $55,000. “Bitcoin remains fundamentally supported because of growing demand as major companies warm towards cryptocurrencies. So, we may not see the repeat of the late 2017-style sell-off,” he added. PayPal users in the US can buy and sell a selection of cryptocurrencies, while Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, recently said he and the rapper Jay-Z would buy 500 bitcoin – now worth £25m – to start an endowment fund for Africa and India. Morgan Stanley has said its $150bn investment fund is looking closely at a large purchase of bitcoins, while it is understood that Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, which have been wary of cryptocurrencies, are soon to announce investments. Is bitcoin a scam? – podcast Read more As the price of bitcoin rocketed in late 2017, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the currency a fraud that would not end well, saying he would “fire in a second” any JP Morgan staff member trading bitcoin, because it was against the bank’s rules and was “stupid”. More recently, however, Dimon’s views have changed, and he conceded at the end of last year that a number of “very smart people” were buying the cryptocurrency, although he said it was “not my cup of tea”. Critics have accused bitcoin miners who search for “hidden” coins of burning through terawatts of energy on their computers and of creating an unregulated market vulnerable to sophisticated fraudsters. There are also many sceptics who say the price boom cannot last. Last month the Bank of America Securities’ chief investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, said the recent surge in price may be “the mother of all bubbles”. Sign up to the daily Business Today email European Central Bank governing council member Gabriel Makhlouf said he would not buy bitcoin. He also compared investment in the cryptocurrency to the 17th-century Netherlands tulip craze, which ended in collapse and widespread personal bankruptcies. Bitcoin investors should be prepared to “lose all their money”, he said, repeating a warning from last month, though he added that he is not advising people whether or not to invest in the digital currency. “Personally, I wouldn’t put my money into it, but clearly, some people think it’s a good bet,” said Makhlouf, who is also governor of Ireland’s central bank. “Three hundred years ago, people put money into tulips because they thought it was an investment.” Bitcoin fell back below $50,000 at the start of the Asian trading session on Wednesday and was fetching $49,322 at 5am GMT.

The price surge means Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla has piled up a virtual profit of $420m in the week since the entrepreneur said the business had bought bitcoins then worth $1.5bn. At the time of the announcement, on 8 February, bitcoin was trading at $39,406. Only last March, bitcoin was trading at below $6,000 and in 2016 a single coin was worth less than $400. Analysts said the increase was a combination of endorsements from prominent business people, including Musk, and several investment banks that have said they would buy the currency. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said bitcoin’s longer-term prospects depended on whether more people embraced the cryptocurrency. “The more people that adapt it and use it as money, the greater the chances of it perhaps being taken on board as a mainstream currency,” he said. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, reckons some investors will be taking profits, as the $50k milestone had been seen as a key target. Once the profit taking is over, it could soar towards $55,000. “Bitcoin remains fundamentally supported because of growing demand as major companies warm towards cryptocurrencies. So, we may not see the repeat of the late 2017-style sell-off,” he added. PayPal users in the US can buy and sell a selection of cryptocurrencies, while Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, recently said he and the rapper Jay-Z would buy 500 bitcoin – now worth £25m – to start an endowment fund for Africa and India. Morgan Stanley has said its $150bn investment fund is looking closely at a large purchase of bitcoins, while it is understood that Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, which have been wary of cryptocurrencies, are soon to announce investments. Is bitcoin a scam? – podcast Read more As the price of bitcoin rocketed in late 2017, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the currency a fraud that would not end well, saying he would “fire in a second” any JP Morgan staff member trading bitcoin, because it was against the bank’s rules and was “stupid”. More recently, however, Dimon’s views have changed, and he conceded at the end of last year that a number of “very smart people” were buying the cryptocurrency, although he said it was “not my cup of tea”. Critics have accused bitcoin miners who search for “hidden” coins of burning through terawatts of energy on their computers and of creating an unregulated market vulnerable to sophisticated fraudsters. There are also many sceptics who say the price boom cannot last. Last month the Bank of America Securities’ chief investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, said the recent surge in price may be “the mother of all bubbles”. Sign up to the daily Business Today email European Central Bank governing council member Gabriel Makhlouf said he would not buy bitcoin. He also compared investment in the cryptocurrency to the 17th-century Netherlands tulip craze, which ended in collapse and widespread personal bankruptcies. Bitcoin investors should be prepared to “lose all their money”, he said, repeating a warning from last month, though he added that he is not advising people whether or not to invest in the digital currency. “Personally, I wouldn’t put my money into it, but clearly, some people think it’s a good bet,” said Makhlouf, who is also governor of Ireland’s central bank. “Three hundred years ago, people put money into tulips because they thought it was an investment.” Bitcoin fell back below $50,000 at the start of the Asian trading session on Wednesday and was fetching $49,322 at 5am GMT.

Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images Prince Philip was the longest-serving consort of a British monarch, described by the Queen as her ‘strength and stay’ by Stephen Bates Fri 9 Apr 2021 12.08 EDT First published on Fri 9 Apr 2021 08.23 EDT Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who has died aged 99, was the Queen’s husband for 73 years. He was the longest-serving royal consort in British history, the family’s patriarch and a well-known figure in public life for two-thirds of a century until his final disappearance into seclusion in 2019. This was a marathon stint on which he had originally embarked with resignation, in the belief that a life of walking several steps behind his wife, curbing his opinions – though not always his tongue – and being an appendage to the institution, without even being able to pass on his surname to his children, would turn him into “nothing but a bloody amoeba”. Things did not work out that badly. He brought a relaxed, mostly affable, peppery, outspoken – and occasionally brusque – style to a ceremonial monarchy that would have been more hidebound, introverted, insipid and decidedly stuffy without him. He introduced badly needed fresh air into the royal family but, while his longevity ensured that he became an integral part of the family firm, he clearly never forgot his initial, impecunious, foreign and outsider status within the institution. His dutiful support for his wife and his engagement in public visits, ceremonial occasions and foreign trips continued well into old age. In 2011, he said in a television interview that he was winding down, but it was not until 2017 that he completed his final public engagement and it was only in January 2019, when he gave up driving after causing a car crash near the Sandringham estate, that he disappeared from view. He became the focus of attention again in February 2021, when he went into King Edward VII’s hospital in central London after an infection. Although he came to loathe the media for their intrusiveness, he played a considerable part in dragging the monarchy into the modern age. The pioneering 1969 television documentary Royal Family, scripted by Antony Jay, which charted the royal family’s year, showing them in off-duty, admittedly somewhat stilted moments, had received his support in the face of the disapproval of palace courtiers and advisers. The film was reportedly seen by two-thirds of the population, and was blamed by some commentators for a breakdown in deference towards the royal family.

Photograph: PA If his tally of accomplishments was modest, this was at least partly because the role to which he was confined had been diminished. Although Philip was intelligent, with physical presence, energy and a clipped, ironic way of speaking, he took care to conceal his intellectual interests, which included poetry and theology, behind his bluff exterior. He had a fine private art collection, painted a little himself and had a well-thumbed personal library of more than 11,000 books, with perhaps surprising inclusions such as the works of TS Eliot. “Don’t tell anyone,” he would say. Clerics visiting Balmoral or Sandringham to preach Sunday sermons could be disconcerted by his beady-eyed scrutiny from the front pew and his close questioning over lunch afterwards. Though frustrated, particularly in the early years of the reign, by his lack of personal scope, he made the most of the role that was open to him. He was a loyal and closely engaged patron of a wide range of organisations and causes, ranging from the postwar national playing fields movement to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, of which he was patron for 55 years. He was the first UK president of the World Wildlife Fund, from 1961 to 1982, and international president from 1981 to 1996. After giving up polo in his late 40s, he took up carriage driving, and was instrumental in formalising it as a competitive sport. His book Thirty Years On and Off the Box Seat was published in 2004, and he continued to drive into his 90s. In 1967, he helped set up the Maritime Trust, concerned with the conservation of historic vessels, and as patron of the National Maritime Museum, in Greenwich, he was involved in the work to save the tea clipper Cutty Sark from being dismantled. 02:58 The life of Prince Philip, the Queen’s ‘strength and stay’ – video obituary Most enduring and significant was his commitment to the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme, which he founded in 1956 with the German educationist Kurt Hahn, to create a “do-it-yourself kit in the art of civilised living”. The programme, operating in more than 140 countries, encourages young people to volunteer for community service and stretch themselves in teamwork and outdoor activities. Since the scheme’s beginnings, more than 4 million teenagers have participated, and the duke continued to present gold awards to the highest achievers into his 90s.

Photograph: Reginald Davis/Rex/Shutterstock At first he had been resistant: “It would never have started but for Hahn, certainly not. I said, ‘Well, I’m not going to stick my neck out and do anything as stupid as that, and everybody saying “Ah! Silly ass,” you know?’” And Philip was perhaps right to think of popular reaction, because he is likely to be remembered most for what the media reported as his public gaffes: sayings, some spoken with naval quarterdeck briskness, some delighting in situational humour, some just – as he himself would have phrased it – “bloody rude”, though these latter were generally directed at members of the officer class rather than ratings. Quite often they were embellished, even invented, in the telling, and often the outrage they were said to cause was largely synthetic. Usually the barked questions and brusque comments were the ironic if ill-judged remarks of a bored man seeking to spark a conversation, or just elicit a response, beyond the usual anodyne exchanges of a royal visit.

He was understandably irked when it was reported that he had told some deaf children standing near a steel band, “Of course you’re deaf if you stand there,” pointing out that he was hardly likely to have said it, as a patron of the RNID whose mother had been deaf. But he did not complain. Philip’s 1971 biographer, Basil Boothroyd, claimed that he inherited an “undisguised contempt for ignorance, stupidity, inefficiency or deviousness in others” from his father, Prince Andrew of Greece, although he could occasionally display negative traits himself when bored or impatient. More likely though, considering how absent his father was for most of his life, they were a carapace to cover the insecurities of childhood. One of his nicknames was “Phil the Greek”, based on his birth on Corfu into Greece’s royal family, yet he had no Greek blood. He was a sprig of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburgs, the peripatetic and frequently exiled Danish royal family that the Greeks imported after winning independence from Turkey in the 1820s. His ancestry lay in the interconnected 19th-century royal families of Europe. His paternal grandfather was Danish, his grandmother Russian: the couple’s seven children spoke in Greek to each other but in English to their parents, whose own private conversations were in German. Philip’s accent was that of a bluff upper-class Englishman, but he was also fluent in German and French and had some Greek. His grandfather Prince William of Denmark – whose sister Alexandra married the British king Edward VII – was invited by the government in Athens to become king of Greece in 1863 when he was 17. William was a disposable younger son, so his family said yes. He married the Grand Duchess Olga, a granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I. Yet one of their daughters wrote: “He always drilled into us that we were Greek and nothing else.” One of their disposable younger sons, Andrew, was to become Prince Philip’s father. Andrew trained as a soldier, speaking Greek as his first language. He married Princess Alice of Battenberg, sister of Lord Louis Mountbatten, later Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Christened Philippos, Philip was his parents’ only son, after four daughters. By then his grandfather, who ruled Greece as George I, had been assassinated by a Greek in 1913, and his successor, Philip’s uncle Constantine, had been deposed four years later for failing to support the allied powers, including Britain and France, in the first world war. After the three-year reign of his second son, Alexander, Constantine was reinstated by referendum in 1920. Two years later he was again overthrown, in a military upheaval. George V of Britain, son of great-aunt Alexandra, sent a naval cruiser to rescue Andrew, who was facing trial for treason, and his young family. The year-old Philip was placed in an orange box and rowed out to the ship with the rest of the family. Prince Philip of Greece in traditional costume, c1930. Photograph: AP Permanent exile was to be the first experience of Philip’s life. He was brought up in St Cloud, on the edge of Paris. His family lived on the charity of relatives: his elder sisters dressed in hand-me-down clothes. Their father, bereft of military command, had no occupation and abandoned the family, retreating to gamble in the casinos of Monte Carlo. Their mother, Princess Alice, who was deaf, suffered from schizophrenia and was confined to an asylum for much of Philip’s childhood, though she recovered, becoming a nun and setting up an Orthodox nursing order. She would eventually go to live at Buckingham Palace, where she died in 1969 at the age of 84. Philip grew versed in keeping up appearances while “skint”, one of his favourite words, being shuffled between boarding schools, first in Paris, then Germany and latterly Scotland, and spending his holidays with relatives, including his sisters, two of whom had married into the German aristocracy and whose husbands became Nazis. Once asked about his childhood home in an interview, he replied: “What do you mean, ‘home’? You get on with it. You do. One does.” From early childhood he was taken often to Britain to visit his maternal grandmother, the Marchioness of Milford Haven; her husband (and cousin), Prince Louis of Battenberg, a former first sea lord, had been created marquess in 1917 after anglicising his surname to Mountbatten. When Philip was asked to tea at Buckingham Palace, Queen Mary found him “a nice little boy with very blue eyes”. He grew up a male tearaway in a female-dominated family. A report from his first school in Paris found him rugged, boisterous, full of energy, polite. After an English preparatory school, Cheam, he went to a secondary school founded in Germany by Hahn. In 1934, he was transferred to Gordonstoun, the Scottish boarding school Hahn established after his exile as a Jew from Germany. It was the nearest thing to an unchanging home for Philip and he was strongly influenced by its values. Prince Philip of Greece, seated, in costume for a school production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun, 1935. Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images Hahn’s vision was to “build up the imagination of the boy of decision and the willpower of the dreamer … so that in future, wise men will have the nerve to lead the way that they have shown and men of action will have the vision to imagine the consequences of their decisions”. Hahn also spoke of “training soldiers who at the same time are lovers of peace”. He sought to instil a commitment to public service, self-reliance and self-control in his pupils – only 30 of them in Philip’s day. Hahn’s influence can be seen in the duke’s award scheme, in Philip’s interest in outdoor activities and in his choice of Gordonstoun for his sons’ education. Philip had loved the school – he said it brought him intense happiness and excitement. Philip stayed with English relatives, family friends and sometimes with the bursar of Gordonstoun. All of them found him cheerfully adaptable, with no aristocratic conceit. His cousin Alexandra, Queen of Yugoslavia, remembered him, on holiday with her family in Venice, as “a huge, hungry dog, perhaps a friendly collie who never had a basket of his own”. His liking for women also stood out. “Blondes, brunettes, red-headed charmers, Philip gallantly and quite impartially squired them all,” according to Alexandra. He entered the Royal Navy aged 17. His uncle Louis Mountbatten, who had taken over his upbringing and was ever anxious to act as royal fixer-in-chief, claimed this was due to his influence, but Philip disliked being thought of as dependent on him. Philip came 16th out of 34 successful candidates in the navy’s Dartmouth exams after studying at a crammer. While his spelling was atrocious, he got almost full marks in the examination interview. He took care to stress that he had been following his father’s and grandfather’s, rather than his uncle’s, example. Philip said: “I suspect [Mountbatten] tried too hard to make a son of me.” He was first introduced to the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth during a royal visit to the college. Maybe she was more smitten with the handsome, blond, blue-eyed youth, five years older than her, than he was with the adolescent princess. Nothing in his copious later utterances hinted at a romantic nature, and the Dartmouth meeting turned out to have been engineered by Mountbatten.

Photograph: Popperfoto Philip won two awards at Dartmouth as best cadet and was enlisted as a midshipman on the eve of the second world war. Kept away from naval action until Greece entered the war, he had his first taste of gunfire off Libya and Sicily, and became one of the navy’s youngest first lieutenants. As second-in-command of HMS Wallace during the allied landings in Sicily in July 1943, he helped save many lives by launching a wooden raft to burn, give off smoke and act as a decoy to a German bomber. He spent much of the war patrolling for U-boats in the North Sea. In 1942, he saw Elizabeth again, at a dance at the Duke of Kent’s home. Within two years he had become a virtual orphan following his father’s death in occupied France in 1944. He was bequeathed little money but was occasionally asked to stay at Windsor Castle while on leave, where he watched Elizabeth act, tap-dance and sing in a family pantomime. The princess might have been besotted, but the courtiers were not, and the footmen noted gleefully when they unpacked his weekend valise that it contained no spare shoes – his only pair was holed – pyjamas or slippers. He was thought to be no gentleman and, in immediate postwar days, to be little better than a German: the diplomat Harold Nicolson wrote of him that he was “rough, ill-mannered, uneducated and … probably not faithful”. The impoverished young serviceman’s name was not in the first XI of the Queen’s list of acceptable suitors, but by 1946 he was being invited to Balmoral, where he became engaged to Elizabeth. “It was sort of fixed up,” he said. “After all, if you spend 10 minutes thinking about it – and a lot of these people spent a great deal more time thinking about it – how many obviously eligible young men, other than people living in this country, were available?” The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth at Broadlands, Hampshire, during their honeymoon, November 1947. Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images The engagement had to be kept secret, but leaked. The palace denied it. In a newspaper poll, 40% disapproved of him because of his foreign background and Germanic relatives. Philip acquired British citizenship, rejecting the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg surname in favour of Mountbatten. In July 1947, the engagement was finally announced. The couple married the following November in the first big public spectacle during postwar austerity. The clothing ration had to be relaxed to provide a wedding dress. Elizabeth took her corgi Susan on the honeymoon. Philip caught a cold. King George wrote to Elizabeth: “I can see you are sublimely happy with Philip, which is right, but don’t forget us.” Honours unprecedented in his family were showered on him: a seat in the Lords, £10,000 a year – a handsome sum in those days – from public funds, the freedom of London, the dukedom and freedom of Edinburgh and a desk job at the Admiralty. Prince Charles was born a year after the wedding, Princess Anne in 1950. In 1949, Philip went to sea again, based in Malta, where Elizabeth joined him – perhaps the only time in their marriage when they could lead relatively normal lives as a young service couple. It was anyway a period that they remembered as so idyllic that they returned to the island in 2007 after their 60th wedding anniversary. They had expected their semi-private life to last for a good 20 years. But George VI fell ill in 1949, and in February 1952 died of lung cancer at the age of 56. Philip and Elizabeth were on tour in Kenya, at the start of a lengthy overseas visit, when he broke the news to his young wife. “He looked as if you’d dropped half the world on him,” said his equerry, Mike Parker. There was some truth in this. Just when he and his wife had embarked on their young family-forming years, Philip, at 30, found himself consort to the Queen, head of an empire rapidly becoming the Commonwealth but still monarch of 16 countries. The Queen and Prince Philip taking tea during a state visit to Japan in 1975. Photograph: Reginald Davis/Rex Features His diminished status as the sovereign’s consort, pledging his allegiance to his wife at her coronation as her “liege man of life and limb and earthly worship”, without a career of his own, was irksome at first. He rationalised and sublimated the boredom as his duty – something well recognisable to men of his generation – primarily to his wife and then to the institution and the country. He always turned up at the right place and time, well-prepared and on top of his brief. At meetings of the organisations with which he was associated, he could be relied on to ask well-informed questions and not allow platitudes or sloppy thinking to prevail. The Queen remained devoted to him, calling him “my strength and my stay”. In the early years, he found a refuge and substitute for the naval wardroom in the Thursday Club, an all-male drinking and dining den dedicated to badinage and practical jokes. It met above a Soho restaurant. Members included the Conservative politician Iain Macleod, the film star David Niven, the mouth-organist Larry Adler and the osteopath Stephen Ward, who became a pivotal figure in the 1963 Profumo scandal. The Ward link inspired a famous Private Eye cartoon cover showing Philip’s coronation robe cast off in the bedroom of Ward’s friend, Christine Keeler. No evidence emerged to support such gossip, although Parker’s estranged wife claimed in a book in 1982 that Philip and Parker habitually slipped out of Buckingham Palace to carouse together under the noms de guerre Murgatroyd and Winterbotham. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the closing ceremony of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images Yet the struggle to define a role was earnest and honest. “I do not have a job,” Philip wrote to his 1991 biographer, Tim Heald. “I never set about planning my career. I had two general ideas. I felt that I could use my position to attract attention to certain aspects of life in this country, and that this might help to recognise the good things and expose the bad things. I also believed I might be able to start various initiatives. You might ask whether all this rushing about (on public duties) is to any purpose. Am I just doing it to look as if I’m earning my keep or has it any national value?” Although he was energetic, industrious and by far the best public speaker in the family, virtually no public discussion took place on how he could be useful. His wife was shy and constitutionally obliged to be non-partisan, which set limits on his public role if he was not to appear a publicity-hog or usurper. Early on, he was dogged by Lord Beaverbrook’s paranoid press campaign over his and his uncle’s German connections, a feud that was resolved between Mountbatten and Beaverbrook’s heir Sir Max Aitken in the 1970s. The equally mass-selling Mirror press under Hugh Cudlipp ran self-consciously “cheeky-chappie” protest editorials whenever he bumped into controversy. Later, the press would construct a highly partial picture of an insensitive and pugnacious figure, which took no account of his more genial and empathetic private relations. This reached its apogee in accusations after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales that he had harried and bullied her as her marriage broke down, whereas it became clear, as his letters to her were divulged during her belated inquest, that he had been concerned and understanding of her plight. The Duke of Edinburgh, left, with Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, 1997. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/AP At her funeral in 1997, it was Philip who reassured his grandson William, who was nervous about walking behind the coffin. “If you walk, I will walk with you,” he said. Philip wrote his own speeches, and many of his so-called outbursts had a knack of being prescient. Early in the 1950s, he told the Society of Motor Manufacturers that thanks to traffic congestion, “it will soon be quicker to go on foot”. In 1960, he advocated “forgiving one’s enemies” to the Anglo-German Association. He denounced “crude, industrial philosophies in agriculture” that would do immense social and demographic damage. In the early 70s, he said Britain was living beyond its means: “Anyone who believes North Sea oil alone is going to get us out of trouble would also believe that social security is available at a pawnbroker’s shop.” In 1977, the year of his wife’s silver jubilee, he compared the British economy to dry rot in a house: “You don’t know when it starts, you don’t know when the crisis is, but gradually the place becomes uninhabitable.” But, in the absence of intelligent public debate, it grew too easy for those he attacked to dismiss him as a loose cannon. On a visit to Canada, the frustration boiled into his angriest, though still controlled, public remark: “It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarchy. It does not. It exists in the interests of the people, in the sense that we do not come here for the benefit of our health, so to speak. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves. Judging by some of the programme we are required to do – and how little we get out of it – you can assume that it is done in the interests of the Canadian people and not our own interest.” The Duke of Edinburgh and members of the royal family watch a fly-past from the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping of the Colour in 2012. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images His sense of resignation about his position was apparent. In 1999, he said in an interview: “What you wish to be remembered for has nothing to do with it. You can wish for all sorts of things. If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.” By the time of his 90th birthday, Philip acknowledged the need to step down from some of his public commitments: “It’s better to get out before you reach the sell-by date.” Reviewing the course of his life in television interviews held no fascination for him. As he explained to Fiona Bruce of the BBC, when he had first asked what he was to do, no one could tell him so he proceeded by trial and error. Six decades later, having been involved with more than 800 organisations, he still had a quite uncluttered view of the uses and limitations of being a figurehead. Barely concealing his impatience with Bruce’s questions and making little effort to charm, he did admit to a desire to slow down: “I reckon I’ve done my bit. I want to enjoy myself now with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say … The memory’s going … Yes, I am just sort of winding down.” Yet he scarcely did so. In 2011, he accompanied his wife on a potentially difficult state visit to Ireland and on an arduous tour of Australia. Although beginning to look more frail and slightly stooping, he remained ever-present and seemingly indestructible at the Queen’s side until the Christmas weekend, when he was rushed to hospital with chest pains for an emergency heart operation – the first significant, publicly acknowledged, illness of his life. A stent was inserted into his coronary artery and he was kept in for four days. Reports suggested he was chafing at the experience and, on his release, he headed straight for the shooting party at Sandringham. The day after standing with the Queen for four hours in pelting rain onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames pageant to mark her diamond jubilee in June 2012, he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection. The Queen had to attend a concert at Buckingham Palace and a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral on her own and cast a somewhat forlorn figure. When asked if he was feeling better as he left King Edward VII’s hospital five days later, he replied: “Well, I wouldn’t be coming out if I wasn’t.” The Duke of Edinburgh, second from left, with members of the royal family during the diamond jubilee pageant on the River Thames, June 2012. Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA The following summer he had abdominal surgery. It took until May 2017 for him to announce that he would be retiring, by not taking on new engagements from the following autumn. His wedding anniversary that year marked seven decades at his wife’s side. Beyond his public service and personal relationships, there was one organisation in which Philip had some clout as an executive – the monarchy itself. Among his first acts as consort was to free palace servants of the 18th-century obligation to powder their hair with flour and starch on state occasions, a “ridiculous and unmanly” rule, he called it. He part-modernised the economies of the royal estates, got rid of debutantes at court, was the first royal to master television and the first modern one to write books and articles. He insisted that his children, unlike their royal predecessors, went to school, and backed Prince Charles’s eagerness to go to university. At the end of it all, as Prince Albert wrote: “The position of a prince consort requires that a husband should entirely sink his own individual interests in that of his wife.” Philip, with a less assertive wife than Victoria but also a weak constitutional position, maintained a stubborn profile. And he ended by printing his own name as well as his own bloodline on some of the generations after him: Mountbatten-Windsor. For an exile who began with so few cards to play, it was no small accomplishment. He is survived by the Queen, their four children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

Photograph: Rex Features Robin McKie Sat 12 Mar 2011 19.05 EST It remains the one untarnished triumph of Soviet science. On 12 April 1961, a peasant farmer's son with a winsome smile crammed himself into a capsule eight feet in diameter and was blasted into space on top of a rocket 20 storeys high. One hundred and eight minutes later, after making a single orbit of our world, the young pilot parachuted back to Earth. In doing so, Yuri Gagarin became the first human being to journey into space. The flight of Vostok 1 – whose 50th anniversary will be celebrated next month – was a defining moment of the 20th century and opened up the prospect of interplanetary travel for our species. It also made Gagarin an international star while his mission was hailed as clear proof of the superiority of communist technology. The 27-year-old cosmonaut became a figurehead for the Soviet Union and toured the world. He lunched with the Queen; was kissed by Gina Lollobrigida; and holidayed with the privileged in Crimea. Gagarin also received more than a million letters from fans across the world, an astonishing outpouring of global admiration – for he was not obvious star material. He was short and slightly built. Yet Gagarin possessed a smile ""that lit up the darkness of the cold war"", as one writer put it, and had a natural grace that made him the best ambassador that the USSR ever had. Even his flaws seem oddly endearing by modern standards, his worst moment occurring when he gashed his head after leaping from a window to avoid his wife who had discovered a girl in his hotel room. To many Russians, Gagarin occupies the same emotional territory as John F Kennedy or Princess Diana. The trio even share the intense attention of conspiracy theorists with alien abduction, a CIA plot and suicide all being blamed for Gagarin's death in 1968. At the same time, his flight's anniversary will give Russians a chance to reflect on the former might of the Soviet empire. Ravaged by a war that had killed more than 26 million of its citizens, the USSR learned, within a generation, how to orbit satellites, aim probes at the moon and finally put a man into space. It was an extraordinary demonstration of the might of the Soviet people. At least, that is what was claimed at the time. In fact, Gagarin's flight was anything but a collective affair. In the years that have followed the USSR's disintegration, it has become clear that his mission was a highly individualistic business with one man dominating proceedings: Sergei Korolev, the chief designer – a shadowy figure who was only revealed to have masterminded the USSR's rocket wizardry after his death in 1966. The remarkable story of his genius, his survival in the Gulags; his transformation into one of the most powerful men in the Soviet Union – and his interaction with his favourite cosmonaut, his ""little eagle"" Yuri Gagarin, is the real story behind that flight on 12 April 1961. Gagarin became the face of Soviet space supremacy, while Korolev was its brains. The pair made a potent team and their success brought fame to one and immense power to the other. Neither lived long to enjoy those rewards, however. The man who would lead the world into the space age, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, was born on 12 January 1907, in Zhitomir, in modern-day Ukraine. His mother Maria left her husband Pavel while Sergei was young and remarried – though Korolev went on to have a good relationship with his stepfather. Like Gagarin, he was besotted with flying and aeronautics and studied in Moscow under Andrei Tupolev, the distinguished Soviet aircraft designer. Tupolev described his young student ""as a man with unlimited devotion to his job and his ideas"". Korolev qualified as a pilot and began designing gliders to which he added rocket engines. In 1933, he successfully launched the first liquid-fuelled rocket in the USSR. He prospered for he was hard-working and loyal to the Soviet system. It was not enough. On 27 June 1938, four secret service agents broke into his apartment and arrested him as a spy. Korolev was beaten. He asked for a glass of water and a jailer smashed the jug in his face. In the end, Korolev was forced to admit to crimes of treason and sabotage and was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour at the Kolyma gold mine, the most notorious of all Gulag prison camps. Korolev never found out why he had been picked out. He survived Kolyma but lost all his teeth, his jaw was broken and he may have suffered a heart attack. He was, as his biographer James Harford says, just another ""egregious example of the incredible stupidity, not to speak of callous cruelty, of the purges of Joseph Stalin"". More than five million Soviet men and women were arrested and either shot, jailed or sent to the Gulags during the Great Purge that was unleashed in the 30s. After five months, Korolev was released from Kolyma – probably because Tupolev intervened on his behalf – and he spent the next five years in jail in Moscow working, officially, on aircraft and rocket design with other imprisoned engineers. Then, in 1945, he was made a colonel in the Red Army and sent to Germany. It was a remarkable change in his fortunes and it occurred for a simple reason: the Russians had captured Nazi stores of V2 rocket components and wanted to use them to develop their own missile system. Korolev's credentials were ideal. The V2's guidance systems, turbo-pumps and engines were of startling sophistication, Korolev realised. However, the rocket's designer, Werner von Braun, and his team had defected to the Americans, with several complete V2s. This gave the US a huge advantage in the race to develop missiles from the Nazis' technology. But Korolev was a gifted engineer and designer – and an obsessive worker. ""I can never forget, on going home, if there is something wrong with a technique,"" he told a colleague. He slept for only a few hours a night, lived frugally and on 21 August 1957 launched the Soviet R-7 rocket, the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile, on a 4,000-mile journey from Baikonur cosmodrome, in modern-day Kazakhstan, to the Kamchatka peninsula. He had beaten the USA by 15 months. ""His ability to inspire large teams, as well as individuals, is proverbial,"" says Harford in Korolev: How One Man Masterminded the Soviet Drive to Beat America to the Moon. ""He had a roaring temper, was prone to shout and use expletives, but was quick to forgive and forget. His consuming passion was work, work, work for space exploration and for the defence of his country. One wonders how he maintained such an unswerving loyalty to a system that had treated him so cruelly."" Von Braun may have built the V2 and later the Saturn V rocket that took Armstrong and Aldrin to the moon, but his achievements were dwarfed by those of Korolev. The chief designer – he was never named in state communiqués because of official disapproval of ""the cult of personalities"" – developed the first intercontinental missile and then launched the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1. He also put into space the first dog, the first two-man crew, the first woman, the first three-man crew; directed the first walk in space; created the first Soviet spy satellite and communication satellite; built mighty launch vehicles and flew spacecraft towards the moon, Venus and Mars – and all on a shoestring budget. However, it was the launch of the first man into space that truly marked out Korolev – and Gagarin – for greatness. Yuri Gagarin was born on 9 March 1934, in Klushino, in the Smolensk region, 100 miles west of Moscow. His father and mother worked on the local collective farm, he as a storeman, she with a dairy herd, according to Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony in their book Starman: The Truth behind the Legend of Yuri Gagarin. In October 1942, the village was overrun by retreating German troops. The Gagarins were thrown out of their home and had to dig a shelter to survive the winter. Later Yuri's brother Valentin and sister Zoya were deported to labour camps in Poland. Remarkably the family survived and in 1950 Yuri was sent to Moscow to train as a steel foundryman before enrolling in the newly built technical school in Saratov, where he took up flying, eventually becoming a military pilot. He was stationed in Murmansk and flew MiG-15 jets on reconnaissance missions. In October 1959, a set of recruiting teams began visiting air bases across the Soviet Union. Nothing was said about the nature of their mission. In any case, most pilots failed the tests they were set. A privileged few, including Gagarin, were selected and sent to Burdenko military hospital in Moscow where the pilot recalled being examined, intensely, by groups of doctors. ""They tapped our bodies with hammers, twisted us about on special devices and checked the vestibular organs in our ears,"" Gagarin recalled. ""They tested us from head to toe."" Korolev – who had already stunned the world with the launch of Sputnik 1, the first satellite – was now preparing for his ultimate achievement: putting a human in space. After his earlier experiment with the ill-fated Laika, he had successfully flown a dog into orbit and returned it safely to Earth. And if a dog could do it, it was surely time for a human. However, at the time, doctors – both in the east and the west – were unsure about how the human frame would respond to the intense forces of launch and then the weightlessness of orbit. Hence their obsession with astronauts' fitness. In the end, 20 pilots were selected – only for them to find that the early version of the Vostok capsule that Korolev had come up with was so cramped, only those under 5ft 6in could get in it. The slightly built Gagarin fitted in nicely. Many of the others did not. In the end, only Gherman Titov provided real competition for Gagarin. He was a brilliant pilot, intense, self-possessed and, as befits a teacher's son, was well-educated and fond of quoting poetry. A week before Vostok's lift-off, the choice was whittled down to the two of them. Titov was convinced he would win but days before launch was told it would be Gagarin who would be going. Titov never got over being the second, largely unremembered man in space – he flew Vostok 2 on 6 August 1961 – and in 1998, shortly before his death, he still spoke bitterly about his rival: ""Some people will tell you I gave him a hug [when his selection was announced]. Nonsense. There was none of that."" Behind the scenes, powerful forces had been backing Gagarin. Khrushchev knew spaceflight was a potent propaganda weapon. ""Khrushchev and Gagarin were both peasant farmers' sons while Titov was middle-class,"" argue Bizony and Doran. ""If Gagarin could reach the greatest heights, then Khrushchev's rise to power from similarly humble origins was validated."" So it was the peasant workers' son who headed for glory on the morning of 12 April 1961. He took the bus to the launch pad with Titov in tow – just in case there was a last-minute emergency. Both were wearing spacesuits. Then Gagarin stood up to go. ""According to Russian tradition, one should kiss the person going away three times on alternating cheeks,"" cameraman Vladimir Suvorov recalled. ""But they were wearing spacesuits with helmets attached, so they simply clanged against each other."" Gagarin squirmed into his capsule and waited. There was no countdown – a silly, American affectation according to Korolev who, at 9.06am, simply pressed an ignition key and the R-7 rose slowly from the pad. Gagarin shouted: ""Poyekhali!"" (""Let's go!"") ""After the launch, there was complete silence in mission control apart from an operator repeating, every 30 seconds, that 'the flight is normal',"" recalls Mikhail Marov, one of Korolev's research engineers. ""Then he announced the ship had reached orbit and there was huge shout of joy."" Marov – a fellow of the Russian Academy of Science who subsequently headed several space missions – today remembers Gagarin's talking quietly and calmly. ""I can see clouds. I can see everything. It's beautiful,"" he told mission control. Around 9.50 Vostok began its sweep over America. Half an hour later its engine was retrofired and the capsule began its descent. Every manoeuvre had been controlled by Korolev from the ground. ""Those minutes seemed like eternity,"" Marov recalls. Then it was announced that Gagarin had landed safely. The Soviet press agency Tass immediately broadcast details of the flight and within minutes, crowds began to fill the streets of Moscow. ""They looked like surging seas,"" says Marov. ""I have never seen such enthusiasm of ordinary people. They took Gagarin's triumph as a personal victory."" In fact, his flight came perilously close to being a personal loss. As it began its descent, Gagarin's capsule should have separated from the main spaceship but a cable did not detach. The capsule began to spin and tumble ""like a yo-yo"" as one engineer later described it, exposing unprotected areas to the searing heat of re-entry. The temperature inside rose dangerously. ""I was in a cloud of fire rushing toward Earth,"" Gagarin recalled. Ten minutes later the errant cable burned through; the two modules separated; and Gagarin's capsule ceased its wild rotation. The cosmonaut, who had nearly lost consciousness, blew open its hatch and was ejected, as planned, to make a parachute descent. He landed close to the village of Smelovka, near Saratov in southern Russia. ""I saw a woman and a little girl coming toward me. I began to wave my arms and yell. I said I was a Soviet and had come from space."" News of Gagarin's flight swept round the globe. ""Man in space!"" the London Evening News announced that day while the following morning's Guardian proclaimed: ""Russia hails Columbus of space: World's first astronaut home safely."" In the US, which had its own space ambitions, the news was less welcome. Reporters pressed Nasa for a quote and phoned press officer John ""Shorty"" Powers at 4.30am. Powers, outraged at the call, snarled: ""What is this! We're all asleep down here!"" Next morning's US headlines included the classic: ""Soviets put man in space. Spokesman says US asleep."" Powers wasn't far wrong, of course. At the time, Nasa was preparing its own manned Mercury missions but had got no further than a 17-minute test-flight with a chimp called Ham. Korolev had beaten the USA easily. ""He seemed to be able to play these little games with his adversaries at will,"" says Tom Wolfe in The Right Stuff. ""There was the eerie feeling that he would continue to let Nasa struggle furiously to catch up – and then launch some startling new demonstration of how just how far ahead he really was."" One newspaper cartoon even showed a chimpanzee telling another: ""We are a little behind the Russians and a little ahead of the Americans."" Hugo Young, writing in the Times, was more straightforward. ""Gagarin's triumph pitilessly mocked the image of dynamism which President Kennedy had offered the American people. It had to be avenged almost as much for his sake as for the nation's."" So Kennedy wrote a memo demanding that a space programme be found that promised dramatic results and that the United States could win. The crucial words were ""dramatic"" and ""win"". Only a manned lunar landing filled those criteria. Thus, on 25 May 1961 – a few weeks after Gagarin's flight – Kennedy made his speech committing the United States to sending a man to the moon and returning him safely before the end of the decade. The Space Race was on. ""That speech, that reaction needs to be understood as a key part of the fight of Yuri Gagarin because his mission was the immediate stimulus for the landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin,"" says space expert Professor John Logsdon of George Washington University. Few observers gave America much chance of victory. The Soviet programme looked unbeatable with Gagarin and Korolev as its face and brains. It was not to be, however. Korolev was living on borrowed time. He had already suffered one heart attack and was now succumbing slowly to illnesses brought on by his treatment in the Gulag. ""People thought of him as a burly man, built like a bear, but the truth was that his body was made rigid by countless ancient injuries,"" say Doran and Bizony. ""He could not turn his neck, but had to swivel his upper torso to look people in the eye; nor could he open his jaws wide enough to laugh out loud."" On 5 January 1966, Korolev was admitted to hospital for what was supposed to be routine surgery. But during the operation, on 14 January, he haemorrhaged on the operating table. Doctors tried to put a tube into his lungs to keep him breathing but found his jaw had been broken so badly in the Gulag, they couldn't pass it through his damaged throat. He never regained consciousness and died, aged 59, later that day. For the first time, the Soviet people learned who the chief designer was. Pravda ran a two-page obituary and Korolev was given a state funeral. Thousands gathered as his ashes were carried through Red Square to the Kremlin Wall. Gagarin gave the final eulogy. Korolev's little eagle only survived his mentor by two years. On 27 March, Gagarin took off from Chkalovsky airbase on a MiG-15UTI jet with fellow pilot Vladimir Seryogin. It crashed a few minutes later, killing both men. A KGB investigation suggested that a near-miss with another jet had sent Gagarin's plane spinning out of control, though the cause of the accident remains unclear and the subject of unending conspiracy theories. On 4 April 1968 – after a huge state funeral in which tens of thousands gathered – Gagarin's ashes were interred close to Korolev's. The Soviet space programme had been orphaned. Before his death, Korolev had designed a mighty launcher, the N1, which was intended to carry men to the moon. Engineers continued to work on it but without the chief designer's guidance and inspiration, they were lost. In 1969, just as America was perfecting its Apollo missions, two unmanned test N1 launches were carried out. The first exploded in flight. The second didn't even make it off the launch pad. ""The rocket fell over, destroying the entire launch complex,"" says Harford. The Soviet lunar dream was over. Weeks later, Armstrong and Aldrin were walking on the moon. The might of the US aerospace industry had prevailed and America emerged as winners of the space race, though there is an ironic coda to this story, one that Korolev would have certainly enjoyed. After Apollo, the US went on to develop the space shuttle, the world's first reusable spacecraft, which was used – among many tasks – to construct the international space station. By the 1980s, the US was flaunting its space prowess. Then things went badly awry. Two shuttle accidents caused the deaths of 14 astronauts. As a result, the craft will be grounded later this year. And after that, there will be only one way to get astronauts – no matter what their nationality – to the space station: on a Russian Soyuz launcher, a rocket derived from the R-7 that Korolev designed to put Gagarin into space. As Logsdon says: ""The rocket we now rely on to put humans into space is essentially the same launch vehicle, taking off from the same launch pad, that was built by Korolev and which took Gagarin into space. Half a century later, we are back where we started. It raises the question of whether or not the world is serious about human spaceflight."" It also demonstrates, starkly, the enduring genius of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the man who launched Yuri Gagarin.

Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images Prince Philip was the longest-serving consort of a British monarch, described by the Queen as her ‘strength and stay’ by Stephen Bates Fri 9 Apr 2021 12.08 EDT First published on Fri 9 Apr 2021 08.23 EDT Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who has died aged 99, was the Queen’s husband for 73 years. He was the longest-serving royal consort in British history, the family’s patriarch and a well-known figure in public life for two-thirds of a century until his final disappearance into seclusion in 2019. This was a marathon stint on which he had originally embarked with resignation, in the belief that a life of walking several steps behind his wife, curbing his opinions – though not always his tongue – and being an appendage to the institution, without even being able to pass on his surname to his children, would turn him into “nothing but a bloody amoeba”. Things did not work out that badly. He brought a relaxed, mostly affable, peppery, outspoken – and occasionally brusque – style to a ceremonial monarchy that would have been more hidebound, introverted, insipid and decidedly stuffy without him. He introduced badly needed fresh air into the royal family but, while his longevity ensured that he became an integral part of the family firm, he clearly never forgot his initial, impecunious, foreign and outsider status within the institution. His dutiful support for his wife and his engagement in public visits, ceremonial occasions and foreign trips continued well into old age. In 2011, he said in a television interview that he was winding down, but it was not until 2017 that he completed his final public engagement and it was only in January 2019, when he gave up driving after causing a car crash near the Sandringham estate, that he disappeared from view. He became the focus of attention again in February 2021, when he went into King Edward VII’s hospital in central London after an infection. Although he came to loathe the media for their intrusiveness, he played a considerable part in dragging the monarchy into the modern age. The pioneering 1969 television documentary Royal Family, scripted by Antony Jay, which charted the royal family’s year, showing them in off-duty, admittedly somewhat stilted moments, had received his support in the face of the disapproval of palace courtiers and advisers. The film was reportedly seen by two-thirds of the population, and was blamed by some commentators for a breakdown in deference towards the royal family.

Photograph: PA If his tally of accomplishments was modest, this was at least partly because the role to which he was confined had been diminished. Although Philip was intelligent, with physical presence, energy and a clipped, ironic way of speaking, he took care to conceal his intellectual interests, which included poetry and theology, behind his bluff exterior. He had a fine private art collection, painted a little himself and had a well-thumbed personal library of more than 11,000 books, with perhaps surprising inclusions such as the works of TS Eliot. “Don’t tell anyone,” he would say. Clerics visiting Balmoral or Sandringham to preach Sunday sermons could be disconcerted by his beady-eyed scrutiny from the front pew and his close questioning over lunch afterwards. Though frustrated, particularly in the early years of the reign, by his lack of personal scope, he made the most of the role that was open to him. He was a loyal and closely engaged patron of a wide range of organisations and causes, ranging from the postwar national playing fields movement to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, of which he was patron for 55 years. He was the first UK president of the World Wildlife Fund, from 1961 to 1982, and international president from 1981 to 1996. After giving up polo in his late 40s, he took up carriage driving, and was instrumental in formalising it as a competitive sport. His book Thirty Years On and Off the Box Seat was published in 2004, and he continued to drive into his 90s. In 1967, he helped set up the Maritime Trust, concerned with the conservation of historic vessels, and as patron of the National Maritime Museum, in Greenwich, he was involved in the work to save the tea clipper Cutty Sark from being dismantled. 02:58 The life of Prince Philip, the Queen’s ‘strength and stay’ – video obituary Most enduring and significant was his commitment to the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme, which he founded in 1956 with the German educationist Kurt Hahn, to create a “do-it-yourself kit in the art of civilised living”. The programme, operating in more than 140 countries, encourages young people to volunteer for community service and stretch themselves in teamwork and outdoor activities. Since the scheme’s beginnings, more than 4 million teenagers have participated, and the duke continued to present gold awards to the highest achievers into his 90s. The Duke of Edinburgh playing polo at Smith’s Lawn, Windsor Great Park, 1970. Photograph: Reginald Davis/Rex/Shutterstock At first he had been resistant: “It would never have started but for Hahn, certainly not. I said, ‘Well, I’m not going to stick my neck out and do anything as stupid as that, and everybody saying “Ah! Silly ass,” you know?’” And Philip was perhaps right to think of popular reaction, because he is likely to be remembered most for what the media reported as his public gaffes: sayings, some spoken with naval quarterdeck briskness, some delighting in situational humour, some just – as he himself would have phrased it – “bloody rude”, though these latter were generally directed at members of the officer class rather than ratings. Quite often they were embellished, even invented, in the telling, and often the outrage they were said to cause was largely synthetic. Usually the barked questions and brusque comments were the ironic if ill-judged remarks of a bored man seeking to spark a conversation, or just elicit a response, beyond the usual anodyne exchanges of a royal visit.

He was understandably irked when it was reported that he had told some deaf children standing near a steel band, “Of course you’re deaf if you stand there,” pointing out that he was hardly likely to have said it, as a patron of the RNID whose mother had been deaf. But he did not complain. Philip’s 1971 biographer, Basil Boothroyd, claimed that he inherited an “undisguised contempt for ignorance, stupidity, inefficiency or deviousness in others” from his father, Prince Andrew of Greece, although he could occasionally display negative traits himself when bored or impatient. More likely though, considering how absent his father was for most of his life, they were a carapace to cover the insecurities of childhood. One of his nicknames was “Phil the Greek”, based on his birth on Corfu into Greece’s royal family, yet he had no Greek blood. He was a sprig of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburgs, the peripatetic and frequently exiled Danish royal family that the Greeks imported after winning independence from Turkey in the 1820s. His ancestry lay in the interconnected 19th-century royal families of Europe. His paternal grandfather was Danish, his grandmother Russian: the couple’s seven children spoke in Greek to each other but in English to their parents, whose own private conversations were in German. Philip’s accent was that of a bluff upper-class Englishman, but he was also fluent in German and French and had some Greek. His grandfather Prince William of Denmark – whose sister Alexandra married the British king Edward VII – was invited by the government in Athens to become king of Greece in 1863 when he was 17. William was a disposable younger son, so his family said yes. He married the Grand Duchess Olga, a granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I. Yet one of their daughters wrote: “He always drilled into us that we were Greek and nothing else.” One of their disposable younger sons, Andrew, was to become Prince Philip’s father. Andrew trained as a soldier, speaking Greek as his first language. He married Princess Alice of Battenberg, sister of Lord Louis Mountbatten, later Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Christened Philippos, Philip was his parents’ only son, after four daughters. By then his grandfather, who ruled Greece as George I, had been assassinated by a Greek in 1913, and his successor, Philip’s uncle Constantine, had been deposed four years later for failing to support the allied powers, including Britain and France, in the first world war. After the three-year reign of his second son, Alexander, Constantine was reinstated by referendum in 1920. Two years later he was again overthrown, in a military upheaval. George V of Britain, son of great-aunt Alexandra, sent a naval cruiser to rescue Andrew, who was facing trial for treason, and his young family. The year-old Philip was placed in an orange box and rowed out to the ship with the rest of the family. Prince Philip of Greece in traditional costume, c1930.

His family lived on the charity of relatives: his elder sisters dressed in hand-me-down clothes. Their father, bereft of military command, had no occupation and abandoned the family, retreating to gamble in the casinos of Monte Carlo. Their mother, Princess Alice, who was deaf, suffered from schizophrenia and was confined to an asylum for much of Philip’s childhood, though she recovered, becoming a nun and setting up an Orthodox nursing order. She would eventually go to live at Buckingham Palace, where she died in 1969 at the age of 84. Philip grew versed in keeping up appearances while “skint”, one of his favourite words, being shuffled between boarding schools, first in Paris, then Germany and latterly Scotland, and spending his holidays with relatives, including his sisters, two of whom had married into the German aristocracy and whose husbands became Nazis. Once asked about his childhood home in an interview, he replied: “What do you mean, ‘home’? You get on with it. You do. One does.” From early childhood he was taken often to Britain to visit his maternal grandmother, the Marchioness of Milford Haven; her husband (and cousin), Prince Louis of Battenberg, a former first sea lord, had been created marquess in 1917 after anglicising his surname to Mountbatten. When Philip was asked to tea at Buckingham Palace, Queen Mary found him “a nice little boy with very blue eyes”. He grew up a male tearaway in a female-dominated family. A report from his first school in Paris found him rugged, boisterous, full of energy, polite. After an English preparatory school, Cheam, he went to a secondary school founded in Germany by Hahn. In 1934, he was transferred to Gordonstoun, the Scottish boarding school Hahn established after his exile as a Jew from Germany. It was the nearest thing to an unchanging home for Philip and he was strongly influenced by its values. Prince Philip of Greece, seated, in costume for a school production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun, 1935. Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images Hahn’s vision was to “build up the imagination of the boy of decision and the willpower of the dreamer … so that in future, wise men will have the nerve to lead the way that they have shown and men of action will have the vision to imagine the consequences of their decisions”. Hahn also spoke of “training soldiers who at the same time are lovers of peace”. He sought to instil a commitment to public service, self-reliance and self-control in his pupils – only 30 of them in Philip’s day. Hahn’s influence can be seen in the duke’s award scheme, in Philip’s interest in outdoor activities and in his choice of Gordonstoun for his sons’ education. Philip had loved the school – he said it brought him intense happiness and excitement. Philip stayed with English relatives, family friends and sometimes with the bursar of Gordonstoun. All of them found him cheerfully adaptable, with no aristocratic conceit. His cousin Alexandra, Queen of Yugoslavia, remembered him, on holiday with her family in Venice, as “a huge, hungry dog, perhaps a friendly collie who never had a basket of his own”. His liking for women also stood out. “Blondes, brunettes, red-headed charmers, Philip gallantly and quite impartially squired them all,” according to Alexandra. He entered the Royal Navy aged 17. His uncle Louis Mountbatten, who had taken over his upbringing and was ever anxious to act as royal fixer-in-chief, claimed this was due to his influence, but Philip disliked being thought of as dependent on him. Philip came 16th out of 34 successful candidates in the navy’s Dartmouth exams after studying at a crammer. While his spelling was atrocious, he got almost full marks in the examination interview. He took care to stress that he had been following his father’s and grandfather’s, rather than his uncle’s, example. Philip said: “I suspect [Mountbatten] tried too hard to make a son of me.” He was first introduced to the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth during a royal visit to the college. Maybe she was more smitten with the handsome, blond, blue-eyed youth, five years older than her, than he was with the adolescent princess. Nothing in his copious later utterances hinted at a romantic nature, and the Dartmouth meeting turned out to have been engineered by Mountbatten.

Photograph: Popperfoto Philip won two awards at Dartmouth as best cadet and was enlisted as a midshipman on the eve of the second world war. Kept away from naval action until Greece entered the war, he had his first taste of gunfire off Libya and Sicily, and became one of the navy’s youngest first lieutenants. As second-in-command of HMS Wallace during the allied landings in Sicily in July 1943, he helped save many lives by launching a wooden raft to burn, give off smoke and act as a decoy to a German bomber. He spent much of the war patrolling for U-boats in the North Sea. In 1942, he saw Elizabeth again, at a dance at the Duke of Kent’s home. Within two years he had become a virtual orphan following his father’s death in occupied France in 1944. He was bequeathed little money but was occasionally asked to stay at Windsor Castle while on leave, where he watched Elizabeth act, tap-dance and sing in a family pantomime. The princess might have been besotted, but the courtiers were not, and the footmen noted gleefully when they unpacked his weekend valise that it contained no spare shoes – his only pair was holed – pyjamas or slippers. He was thought to be no gentleman and, in immediate postwar days, to be little better than a German: the diplomat Harold Nicolson wrote of him that he was “rough, ill-mannered, uneducated and … probably not faithful”. The impoverished young serviceman’s name was not in the first XI of the Queen’s list of acceptable suitors, but by 1946 he was being invited to Balmoral, where he became engaged to Elizabeth. “It was sort of fixed up,” he said. “After all, if you spend 10 minutes thinking about it – and a lot of these people spent a great deal more time thinking about it – how many obviously eligible young men, other than people living in this country, were available?” The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth at Broadlands, Hampshire, during their honeymoon, November 1947. Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images The engagement had to be kept secret, but leaked. The palace denied it. In a newspaper poll, 40% disapproved of him because of his foreign background and Germanic relatives. Philip acquired British citizenship, rejecting the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg surname in favour of Mountbatten. In July 1947, the engagement was finally announced. The couple married the following November in the first big public spectacle during postwar austerity. The clothing ration had to be relaxed to provide a wedding dress. Elizabeth took her corgi Susan on the honeymoon. Philip caught a cold. King George wrote to Elizabeth: “I can see you are sublimely happy with Philip, which is right, but don’t forget us.” Honours unprecedented in his family were showered on him: a seat in the Lords, £10,000 a year – a handsome sum in those days – from public funds, the freedom of London, the dukedom and freedom of Edinburgh and a desk job at the Admiralty. Prince Charles was born a year after the wedding, Princess Anne in 1950. In 1949, Philip went to sea again, based in Malta, where Elizabeth joined him – perhaps the only time in their marriage when they could lead relatively normal lives as a young service couple. It was anyway a period that they remembered as so idyllic that they returned to the island in 2007 after their 60th wedding anniversary. They had expected their semi-private life to last for a good 20 years. But George VI fell ill in 1949, and in February 1952 died of lung cancer at the age of 56. Philip and Elizabeth were on tour in Kenya, at the start of a lengthy overseas visit, when he broke the news to his young wife. “He looked as if you’d dropped half the world on him,” said his equerry, Mike Parker. There was some truth in this. Just when he and his wife had embarked on their young family-forming years, Philip, at 30, found himself consort to the Queen, head of an empire rapidly becoming the Commonwealth but still monarch of 16 countries. The Queen and Prince Philip taking tea during a state visit to Japan in 1975. Photograph: Reginald Davis/Rex Features His diminished status as the sovereign’s consort, pledging his allegiance to his wife at her coronation as her “liege man of life and limb and earthly worship”, without a career of his own, was irksome at first. He rationalised and sublimated the boredom as his duty – something well recognisable to men of his generation – primarily to his wife and then to the institution and the country. He always turned up at the right place and time, well-prepared and on top of his brief. At meetings of the organisations with which he was associated, he could be relied on to ask well-informed questions and not allow platitudes or sloppy thinking to prevail. The Queen remained devoted to him, calling him “my strength and my stay”. In the early years, he found a refuge and substitute for the naval wardroom in the Thursday Club, an all-male drinking and dining den dedicated to badinage and practical jokes. It met above a Soho restaurant. Members included the Conservative politician Iain Macleod, the film star David Niven, the mouth-organist Larry Adler and the osteopath Stephen Ward, who became a pivotal figure in the 1963 Profumo scandal. The Ward link inspired a famous Private Eye cartoon cover showing Philip’s coronation robe cast off in the bedroom of Ward’s friend, Christine Keeler. No evidence emerged to support such gossip, although Parker’s estranged wife claimed in a book in 1982 that Philip and Parker habitually slipped out of Buckingham Palace to carouse together under the noms de guerre Murgatroyd and Winterbotham. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the closing ceremony of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images Yet the struggle to define a role was earnest and honest. “I do not have a job,” Philip wrote to his 1991 biographer, Tim Heald. “I never set about planning my career. I had two general ideas. I felt that I could use my position to attract attention to certain aspects of life in this country, and that this might help to recognise the good things and expose the bad things. I also believed I might be able to start various initiatives. You might ask whether all this rushing about (on public duties) is to any purpose. Am I just doing it to look as if I’m earning my keep or has it any national value?” Although he was energetic, industrious and by far the best public speaker in the family, virtually no public discussion took place on how he could be useful. His wife was shy and constitutionally obliged to be non-partisan, which set limits on his public role if he was not to appear a publicity-hog or usurper. Early on, he was dogged by Lord Beaverbrook’s paranoid press campaign over his and his uncle’s German connections, a feud that was resolved between Mountbatten and Beaverbrook’s heir Sir Max Aitken in the 1970s. The equally mass-selling Mirror press under Hugh Cudlipp ran self-consciously “cheeky-chappie” protest editorials whenever he bumped into controversy. Later, the press would construct a highly partial picture of an insensitive and pugnacious figure, which took no account of his more genial and empathetic private relations. This reached its apogee in accusations after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales that he had harried and bullied her as her marriage broke down, whereas it became clear, as his letters to her were divulged during her belated inquest, that he had been concerned and understanding of her plight. The Duke of Edinburgh, left, with Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, 1997. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/AP At her funeral in 1997, it was Philip who reassured his grandson William, who was nervous about walking behind the coffin. “If you walk, I will walk with you,” he said. Philip wrote his own speeches, and many of his so-called outbursts had a knack of being prescient. Early in the 1950s, he told the Society of Motor Manufacturers that thanks to traffic congestion, “it will soon be quicker to go on foot”. In 1960, he advocated “forgiving one’s enemies” to the Anglo-German Association. He denounced “crude, industrial philosophies in agriculture” that would do immense social and demographic damage. In the early 70s, he said Britain was living beyond its means: “Anyone who believes North Sea oil alone is going to get us out of trouble would also believe that social security is available at a pawnbroker’s shop.” In 1977, the year of his wife’s silver jubilee, he compared the British economy to dry rot in a house: “You don’t know when it starts, you don’t know when the crisis is, but gradually the place becomes uninhabitable.” But, in the absence of intelligent public debate, it grew too easy for those he attacked to dismiss him as a loose cannon. On a visit to Canada, the frustration boiled into his angriest, though still controlled, public remark: “It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarchy. It does not. It exists in the interests of the people, in the sense that we do not come here for the benefit of our health, so to speak. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves. Judging by some of the programme we are required to do – and how little we get out of it – you can assume that it is done in the interests of the Canadian people and not our own interest.” The Duke of Edinburgh and members of the royal family watch a fly-past from the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping of the Colour in 2012. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images His sense of resignation about his position was apparent. In 1999, he said in an interview: “What you wish to be remembered for has nothing to do with it. You can wish for all sorts of things. If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.” By the time of his 90th birthday, Philip acknowledged the need to step down from some of his public commitments: “It’s better to get out before you reach the sell-by date.” Reviewing the course of his life in television interviews held no fascination for him. As he explained to Fiona Bruce of the BBC, when he had first asked what he was to do, no one could tell him so he proceeded by trial and error. Six decades later, having been involved with more than 800 organisations, he still had a quite uncluttered view of the uses and limitations of being a figurehead. Barely concealing his impatience with Bruce’s questions and making little effort to charm, he did admit to a desire to slow down: “I reckon I’ve done my bit. I want to enjoy myself now with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say … The memory’s going … Yes, I am just sort of winding down.” Yet he scarcely did so. In 2011, he accompanied his wife on a potentially difficult state visit to Ireland and on an arduous tour of Australia. Although beginning to look more frail and slightly stooping, he remained ever-present and seemingly indestructible at the Queen’s side until the Christmas weekend, when he was rushed to hospital with chest pains for an emergency heart operation – the first significant, publicly acknowledged, illness of his life. A stent was inserted into his coronary artery and he was kept in for four days. Reports suggested he was chafing at the experience and, on his release, he headed straight for the shooting party at Sandringham. The day after standing with the Queen for four hours in pelting rain onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames pageant to mark her diamond jubilee in June 2012, he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection. The Queen had to attend a concert at Buckingham Palace and a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral on her own and cast a somewhat forlorn figure. When asked if he was feeling better as he left King Edward VII’s hospital five days later, he replied: “Well, I wouldn’t be coming out if I wasn’t.” The Duke of Edinburgh, second from left, with members of the royal family during the diamond jubilee pageant on the River Thames, June 2012. Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA The following summer he had abdominal surgery. It took until May 2017 for him to announce that he would be retiring, by not taking on new engagements from the following autumn. His wedding anniversary that year marked seven decades at his wife’s side. Beyond his public service and personal relationships, there was one organisation in which Philip had some clout as an executive – the monarchy itself. Among his first acts as consort was to free palace servants of the 18th-century obligation to powder their hair with flour and starch on state occasions, a “ridiculous and unmanly” rule, he called it. He part-modernised the economies of the royal estates, got rid of debutantes at court, was the first royal to master television and the first modern one to write books and articles. He insisted that his children, unlike their royal predecessors, went to school, and backed Prince Charles’s eagerness to go to university. At the end of it all, as Prince Albert wrote: “The position of a prince consort requires that a husband should entirely sink his own individual interests in that of his wife.” Philip, with a less assertive wife than Victoria but also a weak constitutional position, maintained a stubborn profile. And he ended by printing his own name as well as his own bloodline on some of the generations after him: Mountbatten-Windsor. For an exile who began with so few cards to play, it was no small accomplishment. He is survived by the Queen, their four children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters Daniel Boffey Brussels Mon 26 Apr 2021 10.07 EDT Last modified on Mon 26 Apr 2021 11.20 EDT AstraZeneca said it would “strongly defend itself in court” and highlighted its supply of 50m Covid vaccine doses to European countries as Brussels launched legal action against the pharmaceutical company over delivery shortfalls. The Anglo-Swedish firm said it regretted the decision by the European commission to start a legal case over alleged breaches of an advance purchase agreement. AstraZeneca was able to deliver only about a quarter of the expected 120m doses in the first quarter of this year because of production problems at a plant in Belgium, leading to angry accusations from Brussels. Officials in the EU’s executive branch were particularly enraged by the refusal of the company to divert doses made in two plants in the UK. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had claimed he was contractually obliged to provide doses made in Oxford and Staffordshire to UK residents in the first instance. Announcing on Monday its decision to take the company to court, a commission spokesman said the legal claim had been made as “some terms of the contract have not been respected and the company has not been in the position to come up with a reliable strategy to ensure timely delivery of doses. “What matters to us in this case: there’s a speedy delivery of a sufficient number of doses that European citizens are entitled to and have been promised on the basis of the contract,” the spokesman said. “The commission has started legal action on its own behalf and on behalf of the 27 member states that are fully in line with their support for this procedure.” In response, AstraZeneca said it was on course to fulfil its commitments to the EU for the end of this month and noted that its vaccine made up 97% of the doses provided to the world’s poorest countries though the Covax initiative. “Following an unprecedented year of scientific discovery, very complex negotiations, and manufacturing challenges, our company is about to deliver almost 50m doses to European countries by the end of April, in line with our forecast,” the company said in a statement. “AstraZeneca has fully complied with the advance purchase agreement with the European commission and will strongly defend itself in court. We believe any litigation is without merit and we welcome this opportunity to resolve this dispute as soon as possible.” The company’s statement emphasised the difficulties in vaccine production at scale. “We are making progress addressing the technical challenges and our output is improving, but the production cycle of a vaccine is very long which means these improvements take time to result in increased finished vaccine doses,” the company said. “Much work is ahead of us in the EU and elsewhere, as we continue to deal with the terrible pandemic and the rollout of vaccination programmes. AstraZeneca has an important role to play, and our intent remains to do that fairly and equitably at no profit during the pandemic in the EU and around the world. “We look forward to working constructively with the EU commission to vaccinate as many people as possible. Many thousands of our employees working around the clock have been driven by a passion to help the world at no profit; they remain firmly committed to delivering our vaccine to the people of Europe and around the world.” Last week, a number of member states raised concerns about taking legal action given the desire to build up public confidence in the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in the wake of bad publicity. A diplomatic source said an overwhelming majority had, however, responded positively to the proposed claim. The claim was formally lodged in the Belgian courts on Friday. A first hearing before a court in Brussels will take place on Wednesday.

Photograph: Hugh Hastings/Getty Images Sarah Boseley Tue 26 Jan 2021 13.54 EST Last modified on Tue 26 Jan 2021 23.36 EST Why has AstraZeneca reduced its projected vaccine supplies to the EU? AstraZeneca warned the European commission on Friday that there would be a significant shortfall in the promised 100m vaccine doses this quarter, of up to 60%. It says this is due to a technical issue: not enough vaccine is being produced by the main plant making the supplies destined for Europe, which is in Belgium. Making vaccines is not like building houses, where you can add a few more bricks to a wall if it’s too short, they say. This is a biological process and it’s not possible to be certain how much vaccine is going to be made once production is under way. The yield varies. Guardian graphic In this case, there appears to have been a low yield from the cells dividing in the bioreactors in the Belgium plant. The same could happen in any of the other factories around the world making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, including the UK. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, spoke to EU president Ursula von der Leyen about this, telling her they would have to cut their supply of vaccines to Europe. That went down badly in Europe, where there are already tensions over the low numbers immunised with the two jabs licensed so far – from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The UK is thought to have immunised 10% of its residents, and the EU just 2%. The EU’s health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, said AstraZeneca must live up to its contractual obligations. Will AstraZeneca dispatch extra doses to Europe from its vaccine production sites in the UK? This looks unlikely or very difficult. AstraZeneca has committed to delivering 2m doses a week to the UK as part of its order for 100m doses in total. That is pushing capacity fairly hard and depends on no unforeseen issues arising, such as poor yield as in Belgium or other issues such as batch quality. What can the European commission do? There are tacit threats of vaccine wars. The commission could take measures to block the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine – which is made in Europe – from being dispatched to the UK. Kyriakides said Brussels would now insist on being notified of any exports of vaccines from EU sites. The precedent is personal protective equipment (PPE). Back in March, the commission required member states to give export authorisations to those seeking to export PPE out of the EU “in order to ensure adequacy of supply in the union in order to meet the vital demand”. So the new mechanism might be a register of exports – and the addition of a need for export authorisations by member states for vaccines. The German health minister has been taking a hard line, but it is uncertain what the commission will now do. Would this impact the UK? Yes. The government likes to say it has ordered 357m doses of vaccine in total. That’s from the seven separate vaccines it has bought. But only three have so far been authorised by the UK regulator. Moderna’s vaccine, of which the UK bought 17m doses, has been licensed but supplies are not expected until April. So for the ambitious vaccination programme to proceed at the hoped-for speed, supplies of both the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine need to arrive at a steady pace. The UK has ordered 100m doses of AZ’s vaccine and 40m of Pfizer’s in total. How big are concerns about supply more broadly? This is the second supply hitch. The first was Pfizer slowing down supplies in order, it said, to upgrade its plant and be able to produce more vaccine. There will be other problems. Sometimes it will be to do with the amount of vaccine that can be supplied, and sometimes about quality. These would go unnoticed in normal times, and be resolved – but now the whole world is watching, and desperate to get hold of the vaccines.

Photograph: Orlando Barría/EPA Phillip Inman @phillipinman Tue 27 Jul 2021 09.19 EDT Last modified on Tue 27 Jul 2021 23.37 EDT The world economy risks losing $4.5tn (£3.3tn) from highly infectious variants of Covid-19 spreading through poor countries where vaccination rates are lower, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Calling on rich countries to take urgent action to share at least 1bn doses with developing nations, or risk severe economic consequences, the Washington-based fund said the gap between rich and poor economies had widened during the pandemic and risked worsening further next year. A speedy rollout of vaccines has improved the economic outlook in wealthier countries, including the UK, while a lack of resources to improve vaccination rates and support the reopening of their economies has depressed growth rates across low-income countries. Failure to help poor countries fight Covid ‘could cost global economy $4.5tn’ Read more Setting out the downside risk scenario in its six-monthly health check of the global economy, the IMF said the new coronavirus variants would wipe $4.5tn from global GDP by 2025 with the potential for more than two-thirds of that loss falling on middle- and low-income countries. The IMF said financial markets could be thrown into panic if the virus was believed to be spreading out of control, restricting lending and investment, and lowering the potential for growth over many years. While such a turn of events would hurt the outlook for rich countries, the IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said: “A worsening pandemic and tightening financial conditions would inflict a double hit on emerging market and developing economies and severely set back their recoveries.” Global GDP fell from a peak of $87.6tn in 2019 to $84.7tn last year, meaning that a $4.5tn loss over four years would knock 1.3 percentage points off the world’s annual GDP growth. In recent months, the IMF has joined the World Health Organization, the World Bank and World Trade Organization in urging the wider deployment of vaccines across the developing world. The report said that close to 40% of the population in advanced economies had been fully vaccinated, compared with 11% in emerging market economies and a small fraction in low-income developing countries. Gopinath said: “Multilateral action is needed to ensure rapid, worldwide access to vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. This would save countless lives, prevent new variants from emerging, and add trillions of dollars to global economic growth.” The IMF’s most recent proposal to end the pandemic sets a goal of vaccinating at least 40% of the population in every country by the end of 2021 and at least 60% by mid-2022 at a cost of $50bn. “At the end of June 2021, the pace of daily global vaccinations stood at about 40m doses a day, with China alone accounting for more than 20m of those daily doses,” the report said. “High-income countries account for 7m doses a day. By contrast, fewer than 100,000 doses a day are being administered in low-income countries. “Vaccine supplies and deliveries to low- and lower-middle-income countries must increase sharply to meet the proposal’s targets. In close to half of countries recent daily vaccination rates fell below the rate needed to meet the 40% target by the end of 2021.” On its central forecasts, the IMF said the global economy was still on track to grow by 6% in 2021, unchanged from its most recent spring health check. However, it warned fault lines were widening between rich and poor countries – with dramatic results for the shape of the economic fightback from Covid-19. Despite the unchanged global forecast, the fund upgraded its 2021 growth estimates for advanced economies by 0.5 percentage points, but revised down its forecasts for developing countries by 0.4 percentage points. Sign up to the daily Business Today email Next year, the IMF expects the outlook to improve from its previous forecast for global growth of 4.4% to a fresh prediction of 4.9%. However, this growth rate will also be marked by a stronger performance from the advanced economies and a slower growth rate among most emerging market and developing economies. The UK growth rate this year was upgraded by the IMF to 7% for 2021, the highest in the developed world alongside the US. The economies of Germany, Italy and France are expected to expand by 3.6%, 4.9% and 5.8% respectively. Gopinath said many countries were already suffering setbacks to their plans for reopening, including India after a severe second Covid wave between March and May and similar more recent waves in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the IMF downgraded its forecast for China in 2021 by 0.3 percentage points after Beijing scaled back public investment and overall fiscal support. The fund upgraded its growth forecasts for the UK by 1.7 percentage points to 7% in 2021.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent @kalyeena Sun 25 Jul 2021 09.32 EDT Last modified on Mon 26 Jul 2021 00.10 EDT The government could face “limitless” losses as a result of businesses that accept payments in untaxed and untraceable cryptocurrencies going bust, an insolvency expert has warned. A growing number of companies, including the ethical cosmetics firm Lush and office-sharing firm WeWork, have begun taking payments for goods and services in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, alongside debit payments, credit or cash. Bitcoin price slides amid EU call to make transfers traceable, and rise of ‘stablecoins’ Read more But while the shift has been welcomed by crypto-enthusiasts, experts said it could be an easy way for directors to hide cash from authorities, particularly when companies go bust. Julie Palmer, a managing director at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, said the growing popularity of cryptocurrency payments would make it harder for administrators – who are in charge of winding down a business after it fails – to track where money has come from, and whether owners, staff or directors are stripping funds out of the business illegally. It means criminals could walk away with income that would usually be clawed back and distributed to creditors, including the tax collectors at HM Revenue and Customs and local authorities. Palmer said that without new regulations and taxation plans, the government could face huge losses. “The potential is limitless, depending on how popular this becomes,” she warned. It is the latest threat emerging from the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, which have been linked to money laundering and black market dealings. Criminals hoping to conceal wealth from tax collectors and administrators have traditionally had to go through the onerous process of setting up an investment vehicle, such as an offshore trust, to hide cash. In recent years, it has become easier for small businesses, tradespeople and criminals to accept payment in cryptocurrency by setting up “virtual wallets” online. With trusts, “at least we could see the source of that money and where it’s gone”, Palmer said. But with cryptocurrencies, which are harder to trace, “we’ve got even less of a chance of actually tracing that and seeing the money that’s been taken out”. Palmer said there was nothing the insolvency profession could do to tackle the issue on its own and believes UK authorities – who are a “year or two behind” the US on the issue – should take action and introduce laws to ensure crypto-assets are properly regulated and taxed. “It’s potentially a major loss of income tax revenue,” she said. HMRC said it recently released a manual outlining the tax consequences of different types of crypto-asset transactions. An HMRC spokesperson said: “We take action, including using powers provided by parliament to gather data from a range of information sources, to identify and investigate those that have failed to declare all their income and gains, ranging from individuals operating in the hidden economy, through to sophisticated organised crime groups and offshore structures used to hide earnings and other assets.” Sign up to the daily Business Today email The Treasury is reviewing evidence from a consultation on how to regulate crypto-assets. The review is taking place at the same time as the Bank of England and the Treasury weigh up the possibility of digital assets being integrated into the UK’s monetary system, potentially via a Bank-issued asset sometimes dubbed “Britcoin”. While the Bank has signalled that it is open to the idea, its chief economist Andy Haldane has dismissed as fanciful the idea that existing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could become a standard payments mechanism.

Photograph: Practice Architecture/Oskar Proctor A house made from hemp may not be your bag, but it is possible. Photograph: Practice Architecture/Oskar Proctor Helena Horton Fri 27 Aug 2021 07.31 EDT Last modified on Fri 27 Aug 2021 11.15 EDT As we argue over heat pumps and electric car charging sockets here in the UK, it is undeniable that most of our homes have a long way to go to be eco-friendly. To reach net zero, we are going to have to change how we heat our houses. The way they are built will probably have to change, too. Perhaps the ubiquitous squat brick suburban house will become a thing of the past. Hopefully so will our Victorian pipe system and, for those of us who rent, our ancient boilers which make a disturbing noise. We spoke to experts at the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) to find out what the eco-friendly house of the future could look like. An Earthship home in New Mexico. Photograph: Ricardo DeAratanha/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images Design for the sun If you’re lucky enough to be able to start from scratch, you can immediately make proper use of the sun by orienting your house to make the most of both light and heat. The futuristic Earthship homes built by Michael Reynolds in New Mexico in the 1970s were built at an angle to the sun which would maximise solar gain – collecting warmth in an atrium at the front, with the thick thermal mass of the walls then regulating the temperature inside. Using the sun for free light and heat means you will also have to think about shade as part of the design. The house should be built to efficient standards, too. The CAT recommends houses are built or retrofitted to AECB or Passivhaus standard. This essentially means the house will have maximum insulation to keep energy demands down. Graphic Materials In a perfect world, homes could be built from natural products which sequester carbon from the air as they grow, such as hemp, wood fibre, straw and other grasses. A particularly stylish example of a house made from hemp can be found in Cambridgeshire, where the architects who designed it boast that it is made from the plant which grows around it. The home, called Flat House on Margent farm, is constructed from timber, which is filled with a mulch of hemp. But if you don’t fancy that, another excellent possibility is using recycled materials – brick, stone, glass. Unfired earth bricks – which are left to dry naturally rather than heated in an oven – are increasingly being used. Pretty much anything is better than concrete, which is one of the most carbon-intensive materials on the planet. Nature enthusiasts and climate campaigners in European cities have also been lobbying for their local authorities to allow for “green roofs” on buildings, which both help with insulation and can improve biodiversity. In the UK you don’t need planning permission to do this, but it’s best to work with an experienced builder to make sure your roof is suitable. A heat pump. Photograph: Octopus Energy/PA Heating and energy How we power and heat our homes is usually one of the biggest contributors to the household’s carbon footprint. If appropriate for the needs of the house, CAT suggests solar water heating for hot water, especially for larger households (for example, three or four people washing daily). Heat pumps, which take heat from the ground or air outside, are a low-carbon way to heat a home. The government is currently proposing a target of 600,000 heat pumps to be installed annually by 2028. Should you replace a well-functioning boiler immediately? If your sole priority is saving carbon emissions, then Jan Rosenow of the Regulatory Assistance Project crunched the numbers and came up with the answer yes: the savings by a heat pump outweigh the embodied carbon emissions of making it. However, the pumps are extremely expensive. What about your own energy generation? If it is possible to have solar photovoltaics that can be integrated into the roof at the building or refurbishment stage, this is ideal. CAT points out, however, that wind and hydro power are better as community-level projects that the local community could invest in. Switch to LEDs. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian Efficiency Now we have the good energy, we don’t want to waste it. Smart meters can really improve your energy use, but it’s also worth thinking about how you use your home. Programme the timing of your thermostat carefully and turn off radiators completely in rooms which get used less, for example. Energy efficient lighting should be installed throughout the house. And insulation is key. LED lights are extremely efficient, and the new generation comes in much wider settings than the original harsh colours. Getting proper insulation put in at all points is critical, to stop our leaky buildings letting all the energy back out again. The same goes for your water. Water-efficient taps and shower heads are a good way to keep water waste as low as possible – plus there are sensible ideas such as using a bowl for washing up instead of running the tap. Transport Location, location. Choosing a good place to live includes thinking about the transport connections so that you can minimise car use (if you have one) and use your bike or public transport instead. Community Experts recommend a community of eco-friendly homes so ideas can be swapped, and like-minded people can share transport and resources. Community energy projects could end up being a good way for local groups to both reduce bills and improve their carbon footprint. At the moment, politicians are pushing for local energy schemes to be allowed to produce their own electricity; at the moment, all energy produced has to be sold back to the grid rather than directly used to heat homes. Wind and hydroelectric power sources are currently in the works for some communities who hope to be able to run whole villages on the clean energy provided.
