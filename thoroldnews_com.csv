Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide.""

Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week.

Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market.

What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Ridgeway man, 66, wins $1M on lottery ticket Sep 11, 2020 3:21 PM Government seeks input on Greater Golden Horseshoe transportation plan Sep 11, 2020 3:00 PM Man charged for allegedly uttering threats Sep 11, 2020 2:33 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Ridgeway man, 66, wins $1M on lottery ticket Sep 11, 2020 3:21 PM Government seeks input on Greater Golden Horseshoe transportation plan Sep 11, 2020 3:00 PM Man charged for allegedly uttering threats Sep 11, 2020 2:33 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News Niagara reports three COVID-19 cases for the second day in a row Province launches web page making school-specific COVID-19 data available Hirjis message to new Niagara students: No big house parties Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.09129898989898991,0.32083737373737375,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Ridgeway man, 66, wins $1M on lottery ticket Government seeks input on Greater Golden Horseshoe transportation plan Man charged for allegedly uttering threats Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.13378099173553717,0.45123966942148763,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Brock will continue with primarily online classes for the whole year Sep 18, 2020 4:00 PM New CAA campaign targets high drivers Sep 18, 2020 2:51 PM $100K lottery windfall is a home reno game-changer, says winner Sep 18, 2020 12:58 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Brock will continue with primarily online classes for the whole year Sep 18, 2020 4:00 PM New CAA campaign targets high drivers Sep 18, 2020 2:51 PM $100K lottery windfall is a home reno game-changer, says winner Sep 18, 2020 12:58 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Brock will continue with primarily online classes for the whole year New CAA campaign targets high drivers $100K lottery windfall is a home reno game-changer, says winner Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.13142561983471077,0.4647520661157024,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News Nearly half of all new COVID-19 cases in Niagara comes from community transmisison, Hirji warns Restrictions for restaurants, strip clubs tightened as COVID-19 cases rise Another Thorold resident tests positive for COVID-19, Public Health data shows Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.0845111111111111,0.3264131313131313,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Thorold signs agreement to push for industry expansion along Welland canal Sep 25, 2020 5:29 PM Nearly half of all new COVID-19 cases in Niagara comes from community transmisison, Hirji warns Sep 25, 2020 4:56 PM Restrictions for restaurants, strip clubs tightened as COVID-19 cases rise Sep 25, 2020 12:34 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara College wins silver at Canadian Brewery Awards Oct 2, 2020 3:00 PM Former Thorold Mayor's house outgrown by record crop Oct 2, 2020 1:14 PM WATCH: Province pauses social circles amid COVID second wave Oct 2, 2020 12:30 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Niagara College wins silver at Canadian Brewery Awards Former Thorold Mayor's house outgrown by record crop WATCH: Province pauses social circles amid COVID second wave Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.11862947658402202,0.4277548209366391,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks.

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Ugulinis message ahead of Thanksgiving weekend: Follow the protocols Oct 9, 2020 3:26 PM Police not at fault after struggle leaves man with broken ribs: SIU Oct 9, 2020 3:07 PM Search continues for missing 84-year-old Oct 9, 2020 2:24 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Two suspects wanted in relation to armed robbery investigation Oct 16, 2020 4:04 PM Niagara Police charge 20 with impaired-related offences Oct 16, 2020 4:00 PM St. Catharines man, 53, wins $700K lottery Oct 16, 2020 1:46 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Smiling cookies help raise over $80,000 for Hospice Niagara Two suspects wanted in relation to armed robbery investigation Niagara Police charge 20 with impaired-related offences Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.1221590909090909,0.46386363636363637,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women).

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Fundraiser set up for local boy battling aggressive cancer LIVE: Ford, education minister to make announcement at 1 p.m. COVID-19: 25 new cases, 2 deaths, one new outbreak reported on Friday in Niagara Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.1203512396694215,0.45371900826446276,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara placed in 'Restrict'-category amidst rising number of infections Nov 13, 2020 4:45 PM WATCH: 'We're staring down the barrel of another lockdown,' says Ford Nov 13, 2020 2:00 PM 13 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Niagara on Friday along with one new health-care outbreak Nov 13, 2020 12:18 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Niagara placed in 'Restrict'-category amidst rising number of infections WATCH: 'We're staring down the barrel of another lockdown,' says Ford 13 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Niagara on Friday along with one new health-care outbreak Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.12280762167125804,0.47164830119375567,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Watermain break on Albert St Nov 20, 2020 3:28 PM Caring for Community: OneThorold’s annual prayer breakfast goes viral Nov 20, 2020 3:00 PM WATCH: Peel, Toronto going back into lockdown Nov 20, 2020 3:00 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence.

The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Thorold resident among 19 charged with impaired this month Nov 27, 2020 3:30 PM 26 new cases of COVID-19 reported on Friday in Niagara Nov 27, 2020 1:45 PM WATCH: Ford calls on feds to lay out COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan Nov 27, 2020 12:30 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Thorold resident among 19 charged with impaired this month 26 new cases of COVID-19 reported on Friday in Niagara WATCH: Ford calls on feds to lay out COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.12250554323725055,0.4636363636363636,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara Falls to receive up to $12.81 million for tourism industry Dec 4, 2020 4:30 PM 'My face went white': The fight for mancozeb fungicide Dec 4, 2020 2:30 PM Police seek assistance locating missing 18-year-old from Niagara Falls Dec 4, 2020 2:22 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News Brock pushes already postponed Wine Symposium back another year Ontario expects 90,000 Pfizer vaccine doses Monday, vaccinations to begin Tuesday WATCH: According to new modelling, Ontario could hit 5,000 new COVID-19 cases by January Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.0877819006390435,0.3264574314574315,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Brock pushes already postponed Wine Symposium back another year Dec 11, 2020 4:19 PM Ontario expects 90,000 Pfizer vaccine doses Monday, vaccinations to begin Tuesday Dec 11, 2020 2:30 PM Niagara Police stop 600 vehicles during Wednesday RIDE check, arrest one Dec 11, 2020 11:00 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News SIU investigating death of 32-year-old man in St. Catharines Dec 18, 2020 4:48 PM No red zone announcement for Niagara in Premier Ford's Friday update on the state of COVID-19 Dec 18, 2020 3:11 PM COVID-19: 55 new cases, 4 deaths reported in Niagara on Friday Dec 18, 2020 12:16 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News SIU investigating death of 32-year-old man in St. Catharines Dec 18, 2020 4:48 PM No red zone announcement for Niagara in Premier Ford's Friday update on the state of COVID-19 Dec 18, 2020 3:11 PM COVID-19: 55 new cases, 4 deaths reported in Niagara on Friday Dec 18, 2020 12:16 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News SIU investigating death of 32-year-old man in St. Catharines No red zone announcement for Niagara in Premier Ford's Friday update on the state of COVID-19 COVID-19: 55 new cases, 4 deaths reported in Niagara on Friday Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.11958874458874458,0.45259740259740255,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News Pandemic closures change movie-going traditions for many cinema lovers ‘I want the kids back in school as soon as is safely possible’: DSBN chair COVID-19: 61 cases reported in Niagara today Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2020 ThoroldNews.com",0.09242011956297669,0.3385168006596579,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Assault suspect shot by police during arrest Dec 25, 2020 1:59 PM CANADA: Eating disorders in athletes on the rise amid COVID-19 Dec 25, 2020 9:25 AM Good morning, Thorold!

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News New Year’s resolution tips for 2021: Focus on getting to the end of COVID-19 Jan 1, 2021 9:25 AM Freezing rain alert issued for region Jan 1, 2021 8:48 AM Good morning, Thorold!

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News New Year’s resolution tips for 2021: Focus on getting to the end of COVID-19 Freezing rain alert issued for region Good morning, Thorold!

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News BREAKING: 196 cases of COVID-19 reported in Niagara on Friday Jan 8, 2021 12:15 PM Cogeco confirms outages for second time this week Jan 8, 2021 11:51 AM Ontario lockdown may not lift at the end of January: Ford Jan 8, 2021 11:49 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Don't call 911 to ask about Ontario's stay-at-home order, OPP urge Jan 15, 2021 3:27 PM City of Thorold issues statement on stay-at-home order Jan 15, 2021 2:13 PM COVID-19: 152 new cases, five deaths in Niagara on Friday Jan 15, 2021 1:46 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Don't call 911 to ask about Ontario's stay-at-home order, OPP urge Jan 15, 2021 3:27 PM City of Thorold issues statement on stay-at-home order Jan 15, 2021 2:13 PM COVID-19: 152 new cases, five deaths in Niagara on Friday Jan 15, 2021 1:46 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Don't call 911 to ask about Ontario's stay-at-home order, OPP urge City of Thorold issues statement on stay-at-home order COVID-19: 152 new cases, five deaths in Niagara on Friday Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.12250554323725055,0.4636363636363636,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Fundraiser set up for victim in Fort Erie double homicide Jan 22, 2021 3:36 PM Former Niagara Region army cadet director charged in fraud investigation Jan 22, 2021 3:02 PM Province provides $2M to Niagara producer of hand sanitizer dispensers Jan 22, 2021 3:00 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News Province to fast-track COVID-19 testing orders at airports, border crossings LIVE at 3 p.m.: Premier expected to announce screenings at airports, border crossings WATCH: Canadian airlines cancelling flights to Caribbean destinations, Mexico Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.08468644781144781,0.33306923400673405,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Province to fast-track COVID-19 testing orders at airports, border crossings Jan 29, 2021 3:33 PM LIVE at 3 p.m.: Premier expected to announce screenings at airports, border crossings Jan 29, 2021 2:30 PM WATCH: Canadian airlines cancelling flights to Caribbean destinations, Mexico Jan 29, 2021 12:38 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Norgen expands: Thorold company can soon process 10,000 COVID-19-samples per day Feb 5, 2021 4:33 PM Niagara: 61 cases confirmed on Friday - death toll remains unchanged Feb 5, 2021 12:59 PM Ontario economy reopening details coming next week: Labour minister Feb 5, 2021 11:32 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets. More information on World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is available online. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Norgen expands: Thorold company can soon process 10,000 COVID-19-samples per day Feb 5, 2021 4:33 PM Niagara: 61 cases confirmed on Friday - death toll remains unchanged Feb 5, 2021 12:59 PM Ontario economy reopening details coming next week: Labour minister Feb 5, 2021 11:32 AM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Norgen expands: Thorold company can soon process 10,000 COVID-19-samples per day Niagara: 61 cases confirmed on Friday - death toll remains unchanged Ontario economy reopening details coming next week: Labour minister Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.12586580086580085,0.4655844155844156,Positive,Objective

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” More Coronavirus (COVID-19) Local News BREAKING: Niagara placed in Grey lockdown level of Ontario's reopening Feds release details of new land border travel restrictions COVID-19 in Niagara: 38 new cases reported on Friday, one new death Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.08775353535353536,0.33101919191919194,Positive,Objective

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News BREAKING: Niagara placed in Grey lockdown level of Ontario's reopening Feb 12, 2021 3:10 PM Habitat for Humanity ReStores to reopen on Tuesday Feb 12, 2021 2:56 PM Feds release details of new land border travel restrictions Feb 12, 2021 1:06 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic."" More Local News We are excited to introduce The Daily!

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Brock alumnus pairs junk food with wine in latest online tasting event Feb 19, 2021 3:00 PM We are excited to introduce The Daily!

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Brock alumnus pairs junk food with wine in latest online tasting event We are excited to introduce The Daily!

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Concern after elderly St. Catharines man narrowly misses out on COVID-19 vaccination Feb 26, 2021 3:00 PM Niagara mental health agency says region's youth have been suffering heavily during the pandemic Feb 26, 2021 2:48 PM COVID-19: 21 new cases on Friday in Niagara Feb 26, 2021 12:07 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Norgens biggest market is the U.S, followed by Europe. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ Corona virus test kits. Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Quaker Road Public School in Welland active COVID-19 case count jumps to six Mar 5, 2021 3:30 PM COVID-19: 22 new cases in Niagara, number of possible variants grow on Friday Mar 5, 2021 2:02 PM Man wanted by Niagara Police arrested after multi-jurisdictional human trafficking investigation Mar 5, 2021 1:55 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Quaker Road Public School in Welland active COVID-19 case count jumps to six COVID-19: 22 new cases in Niagara, number of possible variants grow on Friday Man wanted by Niagara Police arrested after multi-jurisdictional human trafficking investigation Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.10865319865319864,0.4616835016835017,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara Public Health releases first dates for mass vaccination clinics Mar 12, 2021 4:05 PM Sacred Heart school in Niagara reports positive COVID case Mar 12, 2021 4:04 PM Wild pig protocol published Mar 12, 2021 4:00 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News▲ As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold.

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara grape growers getting to the root of good wine with regenerative agriculture Mar 19, 2021 6:00 PM 'Weight of the world' lifted as City of Welland backs off farmland expropriation Mar 19, 2021 3:25 PM City spent $50,000 to investigate complaints against city councillor Jim Handley, report reveals Mar 19, 2021 3:16 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Source: brocku.ca▲ NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* More Local News Niagara grape growers getting to the root of good wine with regenerative agriculture 'Weight of the world' lifted as City of Welland backs off farmland expropriation City spent $50,000 to investigate complaints against city councillor Jim Handley, report reveals Return to ThoroldNews.com © 2021 ThoroldNews.com",0.13062770562770562,0.45844155844155854,Positive,Objective

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Source: brocku.ca NEWS RELEASE BROCK UNIVERSITY ************************* Women in Niagara are not equitably represented on elected local councils, new research from Brock University has found. And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News Niagara Region mostly pleased with results of waste collection changes Mar 26, 2021 8:00 PM St. Catharines' Merritton Lions Club upcoming charity drive Mar 26, 2021 6:00 PM Outbreak of COVID-19 at Brock University residences after 'social activities' among students Mar 26, 2021 5:36 PM Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show See a typo/mistake?

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.

Photo: Ludvig Drevfjall/Thorold News Expand Previous Next As the coronavirus epidemic is spreading across the world, a Thorold company is working hard to produce tests that diagnose the illness in patients. Norgen, 'Thorold's kept secret', as president, Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad calls the company he founded in 1998, has mainly been producing highly sensitive diagnostic tests for research- and lab uses, selling mostly to the academic world, pharmaceutical- and biotech companies. But a couple of months ago a new task presented itself. Haj-Ahmad and his team started hearing worrisome news reports of a novel virus that had emerged in China. ""When we heard the news of the corona outbreak it did not set off alarm bells, because no data came out of China about the mortality or infectivity rate. It did not become clear until it started hitting other countries,"" he recounts in an interview at Norgen's Schmon Parkway offices in Thorold. As soon as the Center for disease control, CDC, started issuing alerts as well as standards for how a diagnostic test should look, the company moved rapidly on developing a test kit for the collection, stabilization, and transport of samples suspected to contain virus, kits for the purification of the viral RNA, as well as primers, controls and Master Mixes for use in detection of the virus. By the end of this week, the first batch of 20.000 kits that look for covid-19 in patients will leave the Thorold facility, where development, manufacturing, and sales are being done, all under one roof. Major requests for quotas have come in from both Russia and the UAE, both asking for 2 million test kits each - far exceeding what the company can produce per week currently. What Norgen's capacity will look like for the test kits is still being assessed as the completion gets closer, but a rough estimate suggests 100.000 kits could be made in Thorold each week. The list of manufacturers of covid-19 test kits is growing almost by the day as diagnostic companies want to get in on the market. However, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says he does not see the situation as a chance to ramp up sales for the company. ""This is not easy money. We are doing what we can while the virus is spreading and harming people and the economy all over the world. This is not something we can live with."" He says he has seen it himself, first hand. ""I recently visited conferences in the U.S that were practically empty, and the planes were not even half-full. This is going to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy worldwide."" What the outbreak could offer is a chance to find better ways on how to develop antiviral drugs, as a vaccine could take up to a year to complete said the Norgen-president. ""That could change how we manage and control viruses."" As for the alarming reports and more common sightings of face-masks and empty aisles after customers have cleared out shelves of hand sanitizer, Dr. Haj-Ahmad says the issue is blown out of proportion, at least for now. ""It is better to be safe than sorry, but it is getting overboard. The intended purpose is to make people vigilant, but people are not attending meetings, restaurants or sports games. Airplanes are grounded. I say be cautious, but don't panic.""

Mishka Balsom, CEO of GNCC said accommodations, hospitality and retail/trade are some of the sectors hardes hit by the several months-long closures forced on businesses by COVID-19. “They are the ones hit hardest globally and the ones that will take the longest to recover,” said Balson to Thorold News. Job numbers from May tell a harrowing tale of how the region has been ravaged by unemployment, leaving Niagara at 13 percent unemployment. According to the GNCC, 23,700 people less were employed in May 2020 compared to last year. “The Niagara economy is heavily driven by these industries. People feel that and are worried about it,” she continued. The recreational- and cultural field is another sector heavily hit by the pandemic, and for some it has meant closing down business. Canadiana Entertainment, a local variety group hosting live-shows with music and performance in Niagara announced earlier this month that they were going out of business after playing their last show on May 17 in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Then, they were forced to close down, thinking it would be only a temporary situation. “Weeks turned into months. Without revenue and any idea of when re-opening might be possible, the financial situation became dire with expenses and refund requests,” the company said in a statement on their website. Mishka Balson fears that the fate of the establishment might echo into the fall, as wage subsidies end and deferrals of taxes come back to haunt business owners. “We also don’t know how consumer patterns are going to be affected. At Stage 2 and 3, peoples shopping behavior will not continue like in 2019. You can already see that sales are not as high as anticipated in Europe, so that is something we have to take a look at.” However, her impression is that the local business climate is more than ready to open up under the new health- and safety regulations required to be followed as re-opening continues. “Many businesses are offering hand sanitizers and masks. Therse kinds of standard give people some releif and comfort in spending maybe two hours at a place.” For local business to recover, said Balson, local government needs to act with the same kind of decisiveness as the provincial- and federal government that she says has been managing the adjustment well. “We need to see that commitment on the local level and not go forward like it was yesterday, become more resilient and effective by cutting red tape to make it easier for business to swing back. It would be a shame if we didn’t. The costs are high if we do not take that forward.” See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

And while they are more likely to participate on appointed advisory committees and municipal boards, those numbers are still not in line with their share of the population, says the Niagara Community Observatory (NCO)’s latest policy brief, Gender Representation and Governance in Niagara, which will be released later this month. “Our research begins with the supposition that the choices that are made in terms of policy priorities and actions are a function of who is making those choices,” says Carol Phillips, research co-ordinator at the NCO and co-author of the brief. “It’s about bringing people to the table who see life through a different lens and a different experience. In this research, we begin with gender representation.” The brief, co-authored by Brock’s Director of Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre Sarah Pennisi, notes that of the 126 elected positions in Niagara, only 27 per cent were held by women. However, women account for 51.6 per cent of Niagara’s population. When examining 1,220 advisory committee and local board positions, the situation improves somewhat, with women’s representation jumping to 45.1 per cent, but still below their share of the population. “When it comes to government decision making, it is crucial to ensure that investments reflect the needs and priorities of our communities,” says Pennisi. “In short, wise decisions require a more inclusive approach.” The brief warns that this disproportionate representation of women on elected council and appointed committees and boards can lead to a “policy blindness” that can “impact Niagara’s choices of actions, investments and ultimately, whose needs are prioritized and whose remain unmet.” The brief says that while more research is needed to understand why the number of women overall is relatively low and why women’s participation on committees and boards is greater than participation in elected positions, there are a few possible factors, including: Working conditions such as long hours, unpredictable schedules and the toll on work-life balance in which family responsibilities may suffer (responsibilities which disproportionately fall on women). Costs in both money and time spent on the campaign trail accompanied by the perceived difficulty in fundraising. Gender-based media scrutiny and social media harassment. Lack of political confidence. Lack of recruitment efforts. The authors call for a number of recommendations, including: Niagara stakeholders review the results of and assess the City of St. Catharines and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce’s ‘Seat at the Table’ initiative, a six-month mentorship program that ended in June, with a view to possibly expanding it across Niagara.  Any and all policy recommendations in Niagara undergo a gender-based-plus analysis.  Focused recruitment efforts to ensure appointed committees and boards have representation from both men and women.  Research has shown that women’s participation in politics leads to more focus on social outcomes such as greater health spending, poverty reduction, education and supports for children and families. ************************* This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message How did this story make you feel? view results > Happy Amused Afraid Don't Care Sad Frustrated Angry More Local News COVID-19: Efficacy, immunity to illness vs. infection, new variants and the likelihood of eradication Apr 2, 2021 9:25 AM Ontario nurses say they were ignored after SARS, hope their COVID-19 report will be different Apr 2, 2021 9:00 AM Good morning, Thorold!

While there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the global marketplace, right now is an important time for companies to be looking to their futures, and TAP is premised on the fact that export is one of the most reliable paths to growth.” TAP Niagara, part of Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program (TAP), is an innovative and dynamic program aimed at helping small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome barriers to exporting. By pulling together expert partners from the public and private sectors, TAP Canada gives companies access to Canada’s top exporting advisors, resources and contacts. Companies work with industry leaders to build a comprehensive Export Plan, and then begin its implementation. “Participating companies in TAP Niagara get an immersive education in what they need to know to be successful exporters,” Turner added. “While TAP has been presented across Canada as an in-person experience since its creation by TBOT six years ago, we’ve taken on the challenge of creating a virtual, interactive version of the program while still capturing the dialogue and camaraderie that going through it with fifteen to twenty peer companies can provide. We’re excited about how it’s turned out, and looking forward to kicking off the program on Sept. 16.” National sponsorships by Economic Development Canada (EDC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) have made entry into the program for qualified companies uniquely affordable – cutting the normal cost of the program from $5000 to just $495 to participate. For that, companies committed to completing the full curriculum will develop an actionable export plan. Participants in the program have reported an average growth of 33 per cent in export sales one year after participation. Educational topics for the program – delivered once a week for five weeks – will include Financial Planning, Grants and Government Assistance, International Law and Tax, Supply Chain, E-Commerce, International Sales and Marketing. Following the five-week workshops and once companies have drafted their export plans, one-on-one mentoring sessions will take place with trade experts, to fine-tune the plans, and prepare the companies for export success. Local program partners for TAP Niagara include FedDev, Canadian Trade Commission Service, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Niagara Region, St. Catharine’s Economic Development and Tourism Services, Niagara Industrial Association, Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and Innovate Niagara. TAP Niagara program sponsors include: Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman LLP, Welke Customs Brokers USA, and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency. For further details on TAP Niagara, including criteria for participating and how to register, please visit here. While space is limited to ensure effective interaction between the educators, mentors and participants, spots are still available for the Fall 2020 program. World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara is celebrating its 20th year as a member of the World Trade Centers Association in 2020. Its mission is to assist companies in Western New York and Southern Ontario in finding success and growth beyond their domestic markets.
