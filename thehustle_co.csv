Today, it’s remembered as the worst sales promotion in history. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett August 10, 2019 In late 1992, the UK branch of the vacuum manufacturer, Hoover, offered an impossibly sweet promotion: If a customer bought any product worth £100, he’d get two free round-trip flights to the United States. For the 84-year-old electronics brand, it was meant to be an eye-catching way to boost dwindling sales, escape the gloom of a recession, and shrug off increased competition. Instead, it led to the destruction of the company — a precipitous downfall that saw multimillion-dollar losses and customer revolts. The most trusted brand in England In 1908, a department store janitor named James Murray Spangler was suffering from a mean case of dust allergies. So, he did what any entrepreneurial asthmatic would do: he mounted a motorized fan motor on a carpet sweeper and filed a patent for the world’s first household vacuum cleaner. Spangler soon sold the patent to his cousin’s husband, William Hoover, who launched The Hoover Company and began selling the devices all over the US and Europe. For decades, the Hoover brand enjoyed a near-monopoly on vacuum cleaner sales. The machines were so ubiquitous in England that ‘hoover’ became a generic noun (like Kleenex or Band-Aid), used as a synonym for ‘vacuum.’ Its provenance earned it a reputation as one of the world’s most trusted brands. A Hoover showroom in the 1920s (Wikipedia) By the late ‘80s, the company, under the new ownership of Maytag, had expanded beyond vacuums and dominated the British cleaning market. But trouble was brewing. The UK was entering the throes of a recession, and Hoover, a US-based company with a large presence in the UK, faced stiff competition from sexy newcomers like Dyson. In an effort to compete, they rolled out ill-fated products like a “talking vacuum” that warned users when to change the dustbin. Between 1987 and 1992, Hoover’s profits fell from $147m to $74m. In short order, excess inventory began to pile up in its warehouses — and its 50% market share in England began to dwindle. The old vacuum company needed to do something dramatic, daring, and attention-grabbing. And just the opportunity came along. “UNBELIEVABLE!” In the early months of 1991, Hoover’s UK branch was approached by a tiny (now-defunct) travel agency called JSI Travel. Like Hoover, JSI was feeling the squeeze of the recession and was looking for a way to offload cheap flights. So, they pitched the company a novel idea: A sales promotion where anyone who spent more than £100 (~$250 USD today) on a Hoover product at a qualifying department store would get two free round-trip tickets to a destination in Europe. On paper, it seemed like a win-win: Hoover would sell its excess inventory and boost sales; JSI would sell flights in bulk to Hoover and handle the bookings. Hoover knew that if everyone who bought a product applied, it’d be in trouble — so it made the process of obtaining these flights as annoyingly time consuming as possible: A customer buys a Hoover product for £100+ and mails in a receipt + application within 14 days of purchase. Hoover sends a registration form; the customer has 14 days to send it back. Hoover sends a travel voucher; the customer has 30 days to select 3 departure airport, date, and destination combinations. Hoover has the right to reject the customer’s choices; the customer can select 3 alternatives. Hoover also has the right to reject these alternatives and select 3 combinations of its own choosing; if they don’t work, the customer is out of luck. Hoover advertised the promotion heavily in newspapers and TV commercials with an enticing caption: “Two free flights. Unbelievable!” A newspaper ad touting Hoover’s free flight offer (The Guardian, October 1992) By late1992, Hoover products were flying off the shelves and the company’s sales projections were back on track. Then, Hoover made a fatal mistake: it decided to double down. The trans-Atlantic disaster On November 1, 1992, Hoover expanded its free ticket offer to include flights to America. Under a new promotion, that same £100 Hoover purchase could net a UK-based customer two free round-trip flights to New York or Orlando — a package worth £600+ (£1200, or $1,460 USD, today). When Hoover ran this plan by risk management professionals, the company was warned that it would be an absolute disaster. “To me it made no logical sense,” recalled Mark Kimber, one of the consultants. “Having looked at the details of the promotion [and] attempting to calculate how it would actually work I declined to even offer risk management coverage,” recalled Mark Kimber. Unfortunately, Hoover chose to ignore this advice. They decided to proceed, mainly based on two fatal assumptions: Only a small fraction of purchasers would actually jump through the hoops necessary to redeem the flights. Customers would spend far more than the £100 minimum, offsetting the cost. Initially, things went according to plan. Department stores all over the UK became an “uncivilized scene” as thousands of people clammored to buy the cheapest Hoover products they could find. A still from a 1992 TV ad promoting Hoover’s offer (YouTube) In the middle of a recession, shops were selling out of £119.99 vacuum cleaners and Hoover had to put its factories on 7-day overtime shifts to keep up with demand. “The world has gone mad and it is all the fault of Hoover,” wrote the Observer a month into the promotion. “If left uncontrolled, Britain could soon be knee-deep in Hoover Turbomaster Uprights.” But as paying customers would soon find out, this “deal” was something of an illusion. “We don’t want blood. We want tickets.” As free flight entries ballooned, Hoover began to realize it had made a terrible mistake. Sales (and entries in the free flight promotion) soon outpaced Hoover’s projections by 10x: an estimated 300k people bought qualifying products — 600k flights that Hoover would potentially have to pay for. And contrary to its projections, customers were not spending significantly more than the minimum £100. The math was concerning: On the sale of a £119 vacuum cleaner, Hoover made a profit of £30. The two free fights that came with it were worth at least £600. This meant that each customer who followed through with the promotion cost Hoover £570. Though the company generated around £30m in gross sales from the promotion, the cost of the flights was conservatively estimated to be more than £100m. So, Hoover began to do everything it could to fleece customers out of the free flights. It claimed thousands of customers had failed to correctly fill out the forms. It wrote back offering flights that departed from airports hundreds of miles away from customers’ homes. It sent out request forms on Christmas Eve, hoping mail closures would cause people to miss the 14-day deadline to send them back in. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Customers who’d followed all the rules were told their letters had “gone missing,” or that they’d failed to spot some arbitrary deadline buried in fine print. “The whole idea is to dissuade [customers] from going, because each time they go it costs Hoover money,” one Hoover exec told a participating travel agency. News soon broke that not a single flight had been granted — and thousands of angry customers began to take action. One of them, Harry Cichy, formed Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, a coalition to hold Hoover accountable for what they’d promised. It swelled to more than 4k members — doctors, lawyers, pig farmers, and electricians. “We don’t want blood,” Cichy said in a statement at the time. “ We want tickets.” In June of ‘93, 42-year-old Dave Dixon took a more dramatic measure: Angered that he hadn’t yet received his free flights, he decided to hold a Hoover delivery van hostage in his driveway in Workington, England. It remained blockaded by his horse truck for 13 days until a high court finally ordered its release. As the crisis made international headlines, Hoover attempted to shift blame to a handful of executives, the airlines, and the travel agencies they’d partnered with. It fired the president of its UK division, along with two other senior marketing executives involved in the promotion, and announced a plan to invest £20m into a “free flights fund.” But these maneuvers hardly put a dent in the backload of unfulfilled offers. Complete destruction By the end of 1993, Hoover was posting £23.6m in losses on £390m in sales. The once-trusted home appliance king was now the disgrace of England. “Our production losses forecast for the coming years run into millions of US dollars,” Hoover’s US president, Gerard Amman, told shareholders, “[and] 80% of the total is attributable to Hoover Europe.” Eventually, Hoover Europe’s corporate parent, US-based Maytag, was ordered to shell out the equivalent of $72m on flights for some 220k customers — and even then, another 300-350k never received their offer. Hoover’s failed promotion made for juicy headlines in the early ‘90s (The Guardian, The Observer; 1992-1996) In 1995, Hoover Europe was so shattered from the ordeal that it was sold off to an Italian competitor, Candy, for $106m, at a loss of $81m. The company’s market share, once over 50%, dwindled to less than 10%, and the public rated the company’s products “least reliable” in at least 6 consumer reports. The British Royal Family even withdrew the company’s Royal Warrant, a mark of recognition for trusted companies. Worse yet, a “glut of unwanted, unused second-hand Hoovers” — purchased by people just for the free flights — flooded the market, making it impossible for the company to offload new inventory. “Mentioning the name ‘Hoover’ [at a marketing conference] is rather like shouting ‘Hindenburg’ at a 1938 convention of airship designers,” a Guardian reporter wrote in the aftermath of the corporate blunder. Nearly three decades later, the blunder is cited in marketing textbooks as a prime example of what can happen when a company falls short on a promise to customers. And Hoover vacuums, once the star of every living room in the UK, sit in closets gathering dust. Related Posts Recent Posts Brief How much data do podcasts have on you?

But just how lucrative is the business? We spoke to 20+ operators to find out. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett October 3, 2020 Three months ago, Jalea Pippens — a phlebotomist at St. John Hospital in Detroit — had her hours cut. In the midst of the pandemic, the 23-year-old found herself in dire need of a second income stream. One night, while scrolling through search results for “ways to make extra money,” she came across vending machines. The daily minutiae of owning a vending machine seemed a bit dull: buying bulk candy at Sam’s Club, stocking machines, collecting weathered bills and buckets of coins. But Pippens saw an opportunity to be her own boss. She partnered up with her boyfriend and another business partner, bought a vending machine on Facebook Marketplace for $1.6k, and plunked it down at a local auto parts store, where it now grosses $400 per month. “I’d never really thought about vending machines,” she tells The Hustle. “I didn’t even know you could own one.” Pippens is one of thousands of individual operators who make up the bulk of the vending machine ecosystem. During the pandemic, the relatively low barrier of entry has attracted a new generation of vending machine entrepreneurs — schoolteachers, nurses, mechanics, students — who measure profits in $1 bills and utilize new technologies to monitor and scale their operations. But are vending machines really a viable side hustle? How much does the average machine bring in? And what does the job entail? To find out, The Hustle surveyed and interviewed 20+ vending machine operators all over America. A glimpse at the market It is estimated that roughly ⅓ of the world’s ~15m vending machines are located in the US. Of these 5m US-based vending machines, ~2m are currently in operation, collectively bringing in $7.4B in annual revenue for those who own them. This means that the average American adult spends ~$35 per year on vending machine items. What makes the vending industry truly unique is its stratification: The landscape is composed of thousands of small-time independent operators — and no single entity owns >5% of the market. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Some big corporations, like Pepsi and Coca-Cola, own their own arsenal of machines. But vending requires so many moving parts and brings in such slim profits per machine that it’s better suited for smaller operators who can minimize overhead costs. According to a 2020 IBISWorld report, the nation’s 2m in-use machines are owned by 17.6k small businesses, the vast majority of which employ just a few people. The vending industry is broad and encompasses everything from $0.50 gumballs to — well: Live hairy crabs (~$4 each) Beluga caviar ($500 per ounce) Engagement rings ($800) Live earthworms for fishing ($3.50 for a dozen) Morning-after pills ($25) COVID-19 essentials like hand sanitizer and masks ($4.25 to $14.50) Oddities aside, the majority of vending machines (72.4%) house standard snacks and beverages — what are known as “full-line” machines in vending parlance. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Several things attract new operators to vending: Relatively low startup costs: An operator can find a decent machine and buy inventory for <$2k. Scalability: Early revenue can be reinvested in expansion to leverage economies of scale. A largely passive routine: Restocking and cash collection can be reduced to a few times per month. A flexible schedule: Like the gig economy, vending allows operators to set their own hours. But starting out in the business comes with its share of hurdles — the first of which is finding the right machine. A new machine straight from a manufacturer can run from $3k to $8k+ — though used machines can be purchased on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace for as little as $300. As Paul Valdez, a 39-year-old Miami operator, learned, those machines often end up being more trouble than they’re worth. “I bought 4 machines on Craigslist for cheap and fixed them,” he tells The Hustle, “but they were all so crappy and old that no business wanted them.” Once an operator like Valdez has secured the right machine, the next obstacle is finding a quality home for it. Location can make or break a machine’s success — and finding a good one is often a steep challenge for people who are new to the business. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Many of the best locations — places with heavy foot traffic, or large worker populations — are already saturated with machines. Some owners we talked to have to make 100+ calls before landing a decent location. In the end, they often end up paying the owner a commission of 10%-25% of gross sales to drive home the deal. Other owners resort to buying pre-established “routes” — machines that are already placed on-site somewhere — or attempt to knock out existing operators by offering a better service. “It can be dog-eat-dog,” says Alyssa Howard, a 28-year-old who owns 22 snack machines in Colorado. “You have to treat it as a zero-sum game.” The reason for this competition is simple: There is a tremendous variance in how much revenue a machine can bring in, based on where it is. Good margins, small volumes We surveyed 23 vending machine owners with various-sized operations and found that the average operator in our sample owned 13 machines that gross $309 per machine per month. But self-reported revenue per machine per month ranged from just $75 to $650. Note: This data comes from a survey of 23 operators and isn’t meant to be definitive; some vending machines make far less than the figures listed here; others make far more. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Most vendors we spoke with noted big differences in revenue across their own machines. “I have one machine that does $25 every 2 weeks, and another that does $600,” says Everett Brown, a 32-year-old Lyft driver from Minneapolis who vends part-time. “Every location is different; some places suck, and others are gold mines.” Jaime Ibanez got into vending in 2018. Fresh out of high school, he dropped $2.5k — about half his savings — on a refurbished snack machine and found a home for it at a local barbershop in Dallas. Today, he owns 35 machines that gross $10k in revenue every month. His best location, a hotel, earns him $2.8k; his worst sometimes only sees $200. And remember: these figures are pre-expenses. The business comes with its share of overhead costs. For starters, ~50% of revenue goes toward the cost of items that go in the machines. Many operators buy their wares in bulk at Sam’s Club and Costco and sell them for roughly 2x the price they paid. Here’s a look at how a typical vending machine’s margins might look by item: (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Among the other operating costs reported by vending machine owners: General liability insurance (~$500/yr for <$100k in annual sales) Commissions paid to locations (5-25% of revenue) Transaction fees for card purchases (~5-6%) Card reader analytics fees ($10/mo) Storage space for unused machines (~$100/mo) Gas and transportation ($50-$100/mo) Taxes (10-37% of adjusted gross income) Routine maintenance and vandalism repairs ($50-$250/yr) Even something like logistics can be a burden: Vending machines are extraordinarily heavy — 600-800 lbs. — and often require special equipment to pick up and move. All costs considered, an operator who makes $5k per month in revenue might take home something like $2k in profit. To make vending work as a full-time gig, an operator typically must implement economies of scale, building the business up to dozens of machines that collectively generate a livable wage. Operators like Ibanez are constantly reinvesting in expansion. Ibanez with a few of his 35 vending machines in Dallas (via Jaime Ibanez) The biggest input cost of all — the amount of time a vendor spends on-site — has been minimized by technology in recent times. “I can visit all my machines in 2 days and not have to go back for 2 weeks,” says Ibanez. Twenty years ago, operators had to drive to each machine on a semi-daily basis and jot down the items they needed by hand. Today, telemetry tools have largely allowed newcomers to operate remotely. Roughly 70% of today’s vendors use some form of tech (card readers, apps, iPads) to monitor sales and inventory in real-time. On a typical site visit day, Ibanez will get up at 6am, check his apps for inventory, and load up on his bestsellers — Honey Buns, M&M’s, and Snickers — at Sam’s Club. After restocking, collecting money, and doing an occasional repair, he’s home by 4pm. This seemingly dull routine has piqued the interest of hundreds of thousands of young entrepreneurs on the Internet. Ibanez’s YouTube channel, which chronicles his life as a vendor, boasts 362k subscribers and now earns more than his machines. “People love to see the stacks of cash getting pulled out,” he says. But something else is driving this fascination: the allure of a semi-passive income has led to a spike in vending during the pandemic. The COVID-19 boom Barry and Lori Strickland, a married couple in San Diego, run The Vending Mentors, an educational resource that offers an online course ($297) and ongoing consulting services ($97/mo) for new vendors. Their journey into vending began back in 1989, when Barry — then a 30-year-old special education teacher — bought a few machines to make extra income during the summer. Eventually, the couple grew the business to 250 machines and $500k in annual revenue before selling it. Lory and Barry Strickland have seen an uptick in their vending machine course during the pandemic (Barry and Lory Strickland) Since the pandemic, the Stricklands say they’ve seen a huge uptick in interest. This year, 200 vendors have signed up for their course. “A lot of blue-collar workers are realizing their jobs are not as secure as they thought they were,” says Mr. Strickland. “We’re getting tons of interest from people who lost their jobs, or had hours cut, and are turning to vending to take things into their own hands.” Mr. Strickland says that most vendors he knows have seen a 10-50% dip in revenue this year due to the stressors of the pandemic. Radical shifts in consumer behavior, physical interaction, and health guidelines have shifted the vending landscape. Vendors who rely on schools have been hit especially hard; other locations, like nursing homes, have continued to perform well. Despite the shakeup, Mr. Strickland maintains the market is ripe for entry. “Vending machines are relatively safe compared to food prep — there isn’t as much human contact,” he says. “It’s also a business that a lot of people consider to be recession-proof.” In particular, the Stricklands have noticed an uptick in Black and Latino vending machine owners — a trend they attribute to accessibility and relatively low startup costs. VendingNation, a popular private Facebook group for new venders, has grown from 6k to 14.5k members since January — a 142% increase — and many of the new members are from underrepresented groups. Jalea Pippens with a new machine — one of 15 she co-manages with her partners, Steven Lee and Gabriel McKinnon, in Detroit (Jalea Pippens) Among them is Jalea Pippens, the phlebotomist from Detroit. After buying her first machine 3 months ago, she launched Literally Lit Vending with her boyfriend (a nurse), and his best friend. “The pandemic made us into entrepreneurs,” she says. Over the past 3 months, Literally Lit has grown to encompass 15 machines all over Metro Detroit. Recently, they landed their biggest deal yet: 5 machines at a steel manufacturing warehouse. Collectively, the machines now bring in $4k in monthly revenue — most of which is being reinvested into the company. “When I used to see a vending machine at the hospital, I’d spend at least $5,” she says. “Now I’m on the other side, collecting the bills.” Related Posts Recent Posts Brief How much data do podcasts have on you?

Today, it’s remembered as the worst sales promotion in history. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett August 10, 2019 In late 1992, the UK branch of the vacuum manufacturer, Hoover, offered an impossibly sweet promotion: If a customer bought any product worth £100, he’d get two free round-trip flights to the United States. For the 84-year-old electronics brand, it was meant to be an eye-catching way to boost dwindling sales, escape the gloom of a recession, and shrug off increased competition. Instead, it led to the destruction of the company — a precipitous downfall that saw multimillion-dollar losses and customer revolts. The most trusted brand in England In 1908, a department store janitor named James Murray Spangler was suffering from a mean case of dust allergies. So, he did what any entrepreneurial asthmatic would do: he mounted a motorized fan motor on a carpet sweeper and filed a patent for the world’s first household vacuum cleaner. Spangler soon sold the patent to his cousin’s husband, William Hoover, who launched The Hoover Company and began selling the devices all over the US and Europe. For decades, the Hoover brand enjoyed a near-monopoly on vacuum cleaner sales. The machines were so ubiquitous in England that ‘hoover’ became a generic noun (like Kleenex or Band-Aid), used as a synonym for ‘vacuum.’ Its provenance earned it a reputation as one of the world’s most trusted brands. A Hoover showroom in the 1920s (Wikipedia) By the late ‘80s, the company, under the new ownership of Maytag, had expanded beyond vacuums and dominated the British cleaning market. But trouble was brewing. The UK was entering the throes of a recession, and Hoover, a US-based company with a large presence in the UK, faced stiff competition from sexy newcomers like Dyson. In an effort to compete, they rolled out ill-fated products like a “talking vacuum” that warned users when to change the dustbin. Between 1987 and 1992, Hoover’s profits fell from $147m to $74m. In short order, excess inventory began to pile up in its warehouses — and its 50% market share in England began to dwindle. The old vacuum company needed to do something dramatic, daring, and attention-grabbing. And just the opportunity came along. “UNBELIEVABLE!” In the early months of 1991, Hoover’s UK branch was approached by a tiny (now-defunct) travel agency called JSI Travel. Like Hoover, JSI was feeling the squeeze of the recession and was looking for a way to offload cheap flights. So, they pitched the company a novel idea: A sales promotion where anyone who spent more than £100 (~$250 USD today) on a Hoover product at a qualifying department store would get two free round-trip tickets to a destination in Europe. On paper, it seemed like a win-win: Hoover would sell its excess inventory and boost sales; JSI would sell flights in bulk to Hoover and handle the bookings. Hoover knew that if everyone who bought a product applied, it’d be in trouble — so it made the process of obtaining these flights as annoyingly time consuming as possible: A customer buys a Hoover product for £100+ and mails in a receipt + application within 14 days of purchase. Hoover sends a registration form; the customer has 14 days to send it back. Hoover sends a travel voucher; the customer has 30 days to select 3 departure airport, date, and destination combinations. Hoover has the right to reject the customer’s choices; the customer can select 3 alternatives. Hoover also has the right to reject these alternatives and select 3 combinations of its own choosing; if they don’t work, the customer is out of luck. Hoover advertised the promotion heavily in newspapers and TV commercials with an enticing caption: “Two free flights. Unbelievable!” A newspaper ad touting Hoover’s free flight offer (The Guardian, October 1992) By late1992, Hoover products were flying off the shelves and the company’s sales projections were back on track. Then, Hoover made a fatal mistake: it decided to double down. The trans-Atlantic disaster On November 1, 1992, Hoover expanded its free ticket offer to include flights to America. Under a new promotion, that same £100 Hoover purchase could net a UK-based customer two free round-trip flights to New York or Orlando — a package worth £600+ (£1200, or $1,460 USD, today). When Hoover ran this plan by risk management professionals, the company was warned that it would be an absolute disaster. “To me it made no logical sense,” recalled Mark Kimber, one of the consultants. “Having looked at the details of the promotion [and] attempting to calculate how it would actually work I declined to even offer risk management coverage,” recalled Mark Kimber. Unfortunately, Hoover chose to ignore this advice. They decided to proceed, mainly based on two fatal assumptions: Only a small fraction of purchasers would actually jump through the hoops necessary to redeem the flights. Customers would spend far more than the £100 minimum, offsetting the cost. Initially, things went according to plan. Department stores all over the UK became an “uncivilized scene” as thousands of people clammored to buy the cheapest Hoover products they could find. A still from a 1992 TV ad promoting Hoover’s offer (YouTube) In the middle of a recession, shops were selling out of £119.99 vacuum cleaners and Hoover had to put its factories on 7-day overtime shifts to keep up with demand. “The world has gone mad and it is all the fault of Hoover,” wrote the Observer a month into the promotion. “If left uncontrolled, Britain could soon be knee-deep in Hoover Turbomaster Uprights.” But as paying customers would soon find out, this “deal” was something of an illusion. “We don’t want blood. We want tickets.” As free flight entries ballooned, Hoover began to realize it had made a terrible mistake. Sales (and entries in the free flight promotion) soon outpaced Hoover’s projections by 10x: an estimated 300k people bought qualifying products — 600k flights that Hoover would potentially have to pay for. And contrary to its projections, customers were not spending significantly more than the minimum £100. The math was concerning: On the sale of a £119 vacuum cleaner, Hoover made a profit of £30. The two free fights that came with it were worth at least £600. This meant that each customer who followed through with the promotion cost Hoover £570. Though the company generated around £30m in gross sales from the promotion, the cost of the flights was conservatively estimated to be more than £100m. So, Hoover began to do everything it could to fleece customers out of the free flights. It claimed thousands of customers had failed to correctly fill out the forms. It wrote back offering flights that departed from airports hundreds of miles away from customers’ homes. It sent out request forms on Christmas Eve, hoping mail closures would cause people to miss the 14-day deadline to send them back in. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Customers who’d followed all the rules were told their letters had “gone missing,” or that they’d failed to spot some arbitrary deadline buried in fine print. “The whole idea is to dissuade [customers] from going, because each time they go it costs Hoover money,” one Hoover exec told a participating travel agency. News soon broke that not a single flight had been granted — and thousands of angry customers began to take action. One of them, Harry Cichy, formed Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, a coalition to hold Hoover accountable for what they’d promised. It swelled to more than 4k members — doctors, lawyers, pig farmers, and electricians. “We don’t want blood,” Cichy said in a statement at the time. “ We want tickets.” In June of ‘93, 42-year-old Dave Dixon took a more dramatic measure: Angered that he hadn’t yet received his free flights, he decided to hold a Hoover delivery van hostage in his driveway in Workington, England. It remained blockaded by his horse truck for 13 days until a high court finally ordered its release. As the crisis made international headlines, Hoover attempted to shift blame to a handful of executives, the airlines, and the travel agencies they’d partnered with. It fired the president of its UK division, along with two other senior marketing executives involved in the promotion, and announced a plan to invest £20m into a “free flights fund.” But these maneuvers hardly put a dent in the backload of unfulfilled offers. Complete destruction By the end of 1993, Hoover was posting £23.6m in losses on £390m in sales. The once-trusted home appliance king was now the disgrace of England. “Our production losses forecast for the coming years run into millions of US dollars,” Hoover’s US president, Gerard Amman, told shareholders, “[and] 80% of the total is attributable to Hoover Europe.” Eventually, Hoover Europe’s corporate parent, US-based Maytag, was ordered to shell out the equivalent of $72m on flights for some 220k customers — and even then, another 300-350k never received their offer. Hoover’s failed promotion made for juicy headlines in the early ‘90s (The Guardian, The Observer; 1992-1996) In 1995, Hoover Europe was so shattered from the ordeal that it was sold off to an Italian competitor, Candy, for $106m, at a loss of $81m. The company’s market share, once over 50%, dwindled to less than 10%, and the public rated the company’s products “least reliable” in at least 6 consumer reports. The British Royal Family even withdrew the company’s Royal Warrant, a mark of recognition for trusted companies. Worse yet, a “glut of unwanted, unused second-hand Hoovers” — purchased by people just for the free flights — flooded the market, making it impossible for the company to offload new inventory. “Mentioning the name ‘Hoover’ [at a marketing conference] is rather like shouting ‘Hindenburg’ at a 1938 convention of airship designers,” a Guardian reporter wrote in the aftermath of the corporate blunder. Nearly three decades later, the blunder is cited in marketing textbooks as a prime example of what can happen when a company falls short on a promise to customers. And Hoover vacuums, once the star of every living room in the UK, sit in closets gathering dust.

But just how lucrative is the business? We spoke to 20+ operators to find out. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett October 3, 2020 Three months ago, Jalea Pippens — a phlebotomist at St. John Hospital in Detroit — had her hours cut. In the midst of the pandemic, the 23-year-old found herself in dire need of a second income stream. One night, while scrolling through search results for “ways to make extra money,” she came across vending machines. The daily minutiae of owning a vending machine seemed a bit dull: buying bulk candy at Sam’s Club, stocking machines, collecting weathered bills and buckets of coins. But Pippens saw an opportunity to be her own boss. She partnered up with her boyfriend and another business partner, bought a vending machine on Facebook Marketplace for $1.6k, and plunked it down at a local auto parts store, where it now grosses $400 per month. “I’d never really thought about vending machines,” she tells The Hustle. “I didn’t even know you could own one.” Pippens is one of thousands of individual operators who make up the bulk of the vending machine ecosystem. During the pandemic, the relatively low barrier of entry has attracted a new generation of vending machine entrepreneurs — schoolteachers, nurses, mechanics, students — who measure profits in $1 bills and utilize new technologies to monitor and scale their operations. But are vending machines really a viable side hustle? How much does the average machine bring in? And what does the job entail? To find out, The Hustle surveyed and interviewed 20+ vending machine operators all over America. A glimpse at the market It is estimated that roughly ⅓ of the world’s ~15m vending machines are located in the US. Of these 5m US-based vending machines, ~2m are currently in operation, collectively bringing in $7.4B in annual revenue for those who own them. This means that the average American adult spends ~$35 per year on vending machine items. What makes the vending industry truly unique is its stratification: The landscape is composed of thousands of small-time independent operators — and no single entity owns >5% of the market. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Some big corporations, like Pepsi and Coca-Cola, own their own arsenal of machines. But vending requires so many moving parts and brings in such slim profits per machine that it’s better suited for smaller operators who can minimize overhead costs. According to a 2020 IBISWorld report, the nation’s 2m in-use machines are owned by 17.6k small businesses, the vast majority of which employ just a few people. The vending industry is broad and encompasses everything from $0.50 gumballs to — well: Live hairy crabs (~$4 each) Beluga caviar ($500 per ounce) Engagement rings ($800) Live earthworms for fishing ($3.50 for a dozen) Morning-after pills ($25) COVID-19 essentials like hand sanitizer and masks ($4.25 to $14.50) Oddities aside, the majority of vending machines (72.4%) house standard snacks and beverages — what are known as “full-line” machines in vending parlance. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Several things attract new operators to vending: Relatively low startup costs: An operator can find a decent machine and buy inventory for <$2k. Scalability: Early revenue can be reinvested in expansion to leverage economies of scale. A largely passive routine: Restocking and cash collection can be reduced to a few times per month. A flexible schedule: Like the gig economy, vending allows operators to set their own hours. But starting out in the business comes with its share of hurdles — the first of which is finding the right machine. A new machine straight from a manufacturer can run from $3k to $8k+ — though used machines can be purchased on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace for as little as $300. As Paul Valdez, a 39-year-old Miami operator, learned, those machines often end up being more trouble than they’re worth. “I bought 4 machines on Craigslist for cheap and fixed them,” he tells The Hustle, “but they were all so crappy and old that no business wanted them.” Once an operator like Valdez has secured the right machine, the next obstacle is finding a quality home for it. Location can make or break a machine’s success — and finding a good one is often a steep challenge for people who are new to the business. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Many of the best locations — places with heavy foot traffic, or large worker populations — are already saturated with machines. Some owners we talked to have to make 100+ calls before landing a decent location. In the end, they often end up paying the owner a commission of 10%-25% of gross sales to drive home the deal. Other owners resort to buying pre-established “routes” — machines that are already placed on-site somewhere — or attempt to knock out existing operators by offering a better service. “It can be dog-eat-dog,” says Alyssa Howard, a 28-year-old who owns 22 snack machines in Colorado. “You have to treat it as a zero-sum game.” The reason for this competition is simple: There is a tremendous variance in how much revenue a machine can bring in, based on where it is. Good margins, small volumes We surveyed 23 vending machine owners with various-sized operations and found that the average operator in our sample owned 13 machines that gross $309 per machine per month. But self-reported revenue per machine per month ranged from just $75 to $650. Note: This data comes from a survey of 23 operators and isn’t meant to be definitive; some vending machines make far less than the figures listed here; others make far more. (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Most vendors we spoke with noted big differences in revenue across their own machines. “I have one machine that does $25 every 2 weeks, and another that does $600,” says Everett Brown, a 32-year-old Lyft driver from Minneapolis who vends part-time. “Every location is different; some places suck, and others are gold mines.” Jaime Ibanez got into vending in 2018. Fresh out of high school, he dropped $2.5k — about half his savings — on a refurbished snack machine and found a home for it at a local barbershop in Dallas. Today, he owns 35 machines that gross $10k in revenue every month. His best location, a hotel, earns him $2.8k; his worst sometimes only sees $200. And remember: these figures are pre-expenses. The business comes with its share of overhead costs. For starters, ~50% of revenue goes toward the cost of items that go in the machines. Many operators buy their wares in bulk at Sam’s Club and Costco and sell them for roughly 2x the price they paid. Here’s a look at how a typical vending machine’s margins might look by item: (Zachary Crockett / The Hustle) Among the other operating costs reported by vending machine owners: General liability insurance (~$500/yr for <$100k in annual sales) Commissions paid to locations (5-25% of revenue) Transaction fees for card purchases (~5-6%) Card reader analytics fees ($10/mo) Storage space for unused machines (~$100/mo) Gas and transportation ($50-$100/mo) Taxes (10-37% of adjusted gross income) Routine maintenance and vandalism repairs ($50-$250/yr) Even something like logistics can be a burden: Vending machines are extraordinarily heavy — 600-800 lbs. — and often require special equipment to pick up and move. All costs considered, an operator who makes $5k per month in revenue might take home something like $2k in profit. To make vending work as a full-time gig, an operator typically must implement economies of scale, building the business up to dozens of machines that collectively generate a livable wage. Operators like Ibanez are constantly reinvesting in expansion. Ibanez with a few of his 35 vending machines in Dallas (via Jaime Ibanez) The biggest input cost of all — the amount of time a vendor spends on-site — has been minimized by technology in recent times. “I can visit all my machines in 2 days and not have to go back for 2 weeks,” says Ibanez. Twenty years ago, operators had to drive to each machine on a semi-daily basis and jot down the items they needed by hand. Today, telemetry tools have largely allowed newcomers to operate remotely. Roughly 70% of today’s vendors use some form of tech (card readers, apps, iPads) to monitor sales and inventory in real-time. On a typical site visit day, Ibanez will get up at 6am, check his apps for inventory, and load up on his bestsellers — Honey Buns, M&M’s, and Snickers — at Sam’s Club. After restocking, collecting money, and doing an occasional repair, he’s home by 4pm. This seemingly dull routine has piqued the interest of hundreds of thousands of young entrepreneurs on the Internet. Ibanez’s YouTube channel, which chronicles his life as a vendor, boasts 362k subscribers and now earns more than his machines. “People love to see the stacks of cash getting pulled out,” he says. But something else is driving this fascination: the allure of a semi-passive income has led to a spike in vending during the pandemic. The COVID-19 boom Barry and Lori Strickland, a married couple in San Diego, run The Vending Mentors, an educational resource that offers an online course ($297) and ongoing consulting services ($97/mo) for new vendors. Their journey into vending began back in 1989, when Barry — then a 30-year-old special education teacher — bought a few machines to make extra income during the summer. Eventually, the couple grew the business to 250 machines and $500k in annual revenue before selling it. Lory and Barry Strickland have seen an uptick in their vending machine course during the pandemic (Barry and Lory Strickland) Since the pandemic, the Stricklands say they’ve seen a huge uptick in interest. This year, 200 vendors have signed up for their course. “A lot of blue-collar workers are realizing their jobs are not as secure as they thought they were,” says Mr. Strickland. “We’re getting tons of interest from people who lost their jobs, or had hours cut, and are turning to vending to take things into their own hands.” Mr. Strickland says that most vendors he knows have seen a 10-50% dip in revenue this year due to the stressors of the pandemic. Radical shifts in consumer behavior, physical interaction, and health guidelines have shifted the vending landscape. Vendors who rely on schools have been hit especially hard; other locations, like nursing homes, have continued to perform well. Despite the shakeup, Mr. Strickland maintains the market is ripe for entry. “Vending machines are relatively safe compared to food prep — there isn’t as much human contact,” he says. “It’s also a business that a lot of people consider to be recession-proof.” In particular, the Stricklands have noticed an uptick in Black and Latino vending machine owners — a trend they attribute to accessibility and relatively low startup costs. VendingNation, a popular private Facebook group for new venders, has grown from 6k to 14.5k members since January — a 142% increase — and many of the new members are from underrepresented groups. Jalea Pippens with a new machine — one of 15 she co-manages with her partners, Steven Lee and Gabriel McKinnon, in Detroit (Jalea Pippens) Among them is Jalea Pippens, the phlebotomist from Detroit. After buying her first machine 3 months ago, she launched Literally Lit Vending with her boyfriend (a nurse), and his best friend. “The pandemic made us into entrepreneurs,” she says. Over the past 3 months, Literally Lit has grown to encompass 15 machines all over Metro Detroit. Recently, they landed their biggest deal yet: 5 machines at a steel manufacturing warehouse. Collectively, the machines now bring in $4k in monthly revenue — most of which is being reinvested into the company. “When I used to see a vending machine at the hospital, I’d spend at least $5,” she says. “Now I’m on the other side, collecting the bills.” Related Posts Recent Posts Brief The ‘Stripe of Africa’ just got acquired by Stripe for $200m+ By Trung T.

By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett October 17, 2020 In August 2020, Craig Mount and Erika Peterson found themselves in an enviable position. Nerdy Nuts — the D2C peanut butter company they’d founded just 18 months earlier — had gone viral on TikTok. In the span of a few days, the couple had watched their sales multiply by 20x. But they didn’t have time to celebrate. They faced a backlog of $500k+ worth of orders, a depletion of inventory, and thousands of emails from cranky customers. What began as a tiny side hustle at a farmers market in South Dakota had ballooned into a monster. Nerdy Nuts’ journey is every entrepreneur’s dream: Create a cool product. Find a unique way to market it. Hack your way to expedited growth. It’s a case study in marketing, which touches on: The underutilized value of TikTok as an influencer tool The psychological power of scarcity The “Holy Grail” of a product feedback loop But it’s also a cautionary tale about the unglamorous underbelly of overnight success. From idea to farmers market The couple’s path into peanut butter began around 2015. At the time, Peterson was a clothing store manager at the Chapel Hills Mall in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Mount would often grab lunch at a nearby eatery that sold jars of flavored peanut butter. “The shop closed down and I thought, ‘Where do I get this stuff now?’” recalls Mount. “So I just decided to give it a shot on my own.” Peterson (left) and Mount (right), with their son (Craig Mount) In the summer of 2017, he logged on to eBay and bought a used Olde Tyme PN1 nut grinder for $870. But shortly after the purchase, the couple moved to Rapid City, South Dakota — and the machine ended up gathering dust in the garage. In early 2019, Peterson, then pregnant and on the hunt for a new gig, decided to finally put the grinder to use. That summer, she and Mount launched Nerdy Nuts (~$2.5k upfront investment in total) and began selling their first two flavors, honey roasted and white chocolate, at a local farmers market. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle The farmers market was the ideal focus group for a new product. “We spent hours and hours in front of live customers, whom we were able to see test out products in real time,” says Mount. “It became an excellent testing ground — and a perfect way for us to iterate.” By the end of the summer, Nerdy Nuts was the most popular booth at the farmers market, routinely bringing in ~$1k every Sunday. For Mount and Peterson, Nerdy Nuts was only intended to be a low-stress side hustle. Mount already made six-figures running an SEO consultancy, a job which monopolized most of his time. The couple was also raising a child — and another one was on the way. They weren’t looking to start a D2C peanut butter empire. But the market had other plans for their product. The takeoff Purely out of curiosity, Mount began spending some of his free time studying the niche world of peanut butter. He went on a voracious reading spree, learning about the history of modern peanut butter. He befriended members of the American Peanut Council, the industry’s largest trade group. He spent late nights Googling things like “how to affix a label without getting oil on it.” Through his research, Mount learned that nearly 60% of the $1.9B US peanut butter market is controlled by 2 companies: the J.M. Smucker Company (which owns Jif) and Hormel Foods (Skippy). But he also compiled a list of 127 smaller players, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, and saw a trend: Most were marketed as “healthy” or “keto-friendly.” He decided early on that Nerdy Nuts would focus more on flavor and fun. Back-of-the-notepad math Mount jotted down in the early stages (Craig Mount) Seeking advice on where to take the company, Mount posted in The Hustle’s Trends Facebook group, a community for entrepreneurs. In the group, he met a PR whiz named Adrian Salamunovic. Salamunovic was convinced that Nerdy Nuts could be the “Ben & Jerry’s of peanut butter” and advised Mount to double down on quirky marketing. One idea in particular stood out. Back in 2008, during the Obama-McCain election cycle, Airbnb had made $30k by selling cereal boxes themed after each candidate. Salamunovic suggested reprising the concept with peanut butter. In June 2019, Nerdy Nuts released a flavor for each candidate, based on his or her favorite food(s): Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Mount spent 40 hours cold-emailing 200+ reporters and got a bite from Fox Business. After landing a feature on the national talk show The Five, Nerdy Nuts got its first taste of virality. In the first 48 hours after the segment aired, the tiny company made $20k in sales. It was the company’s first taste of big success — and the business was woefully under-prepared for the bump. Their sole machine could only produce 60 jars of product per hour, and they were working out of a “dinky little kitchen” they’d rented from a local catering company. Joined by a rotating cast of family and friends, Mount and Peterson worked around the clock to tackle the influx of orders. Their garage became a temporary fulfillment center. “It was an overnight success story, but it was also super stressful,” says Mount. “You’re just thrown into this storm and you have no time to think.” Peterson receives a huge order of supplies (Craig Mount) The influx forced them to iterate their product: They switched from grinding nuts for each individual jar to grinding “batches” and filling multiple jars at once. They migrated their website from WooCommerce/Wordpress to Shopify — a decision that improved the checkout process and boosted order volume. They went all-in on D2C sales, as opposed to farmers’ markets or traditional retail. Running Nerdy Nuts as a direct-to-consumer business, the couple learned, came with microeconomic benefits. Traditional food brands that vie to get on retail shelves tend to follow a rule of one thirds when thinking about costs and profit: ⅓ = manufacturing costs (e.g., ingredients, production, labor) ⅓ = distribution costs (e.g., grocery store slotting and listing fees) ⅓ = retail profit But going the D2C route, Nerdy Nuts could avoid paying for distribution and reduce the retail price of its products. As a result, the company’s unit economics were better: A jar of Nerdy Nuts retailed for $11.99 and cost ~$5 to make, a gross margin of ~60% before other expenses. Higher order volume soon allowed them to buy in bulk and shave down costs even more. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle By the end of 2019, the couple had netted ~$60k in sales. As the business gained steam, Mount and Peterson grew a little apprehensive about the pace of acceleration. What was only intended to be a hobby was ballooning into a full-time job. Mount decided to just keep things fun and focus on storytelling. On the Nerdy Nuts site, Mount and Peterson focused on whimsy, listing a make-believe product called Unicorn Dust for $777.77. They went into a “heavy development period,” inventing and testing new flavors, like butterscotch, marshmallow, and toffee. Throughout most of early 2020, Nerdy Nuts hummed along at ~$8k/month in steady sales, buoyed, in part, by a wave of pandemic-related peanut butter panic-buying. But they never could’ve anticipated what the next few months had in store. The TikTok explosion In June 2020, Mount decided to test out peanut butter “product drops.” “Supreme clothing, or [Adidas] Yeezy sneakers, have these limited edition drops all the time,” says Mount. “I thought, ‘Why not do the same thing for peanut butter flavors?’” Nerdy Nuts dropped 3 new flavors — Monster Cookie, Oreo Cookie, and Circus Cookie — and turned to Instagram to market them. Nerdy Nuts product drops (Craig Mount) Mount got 18 influencers to peddle the peanut butter, but soon found them to be difficult to work with. “Once an Instagram influencer hits 10k followers, they think they’re some kid of celebrity,” he says. “They have price sheets and agents. They demand monthly retainers. They send you these BS proposals, promising x number of impressions.” The drops were popular and boosted Nerdy Nuts’ sales to $27k for the month of June. But only a fraction of those sales (107 jars) came from the Instagram influencers. Peterson had a suggestion: Why not try TikTok influencers instead? The couple reached out to two TikTokers: Ali Grace Morsell and Hailey Peters, both of whom had ~500k followers at the time. “It was a totally different response,” says Mount. “They were like, ‘OMG, you want to send me free peanut butter?!’ They were just so flabbergasted that anyone would want to send them something for free.” Astonishingly, videos posted by the TikTokers generated millions of views, resulting in 5,947 sales, and setting off a snowball effect. Nerdy Nuts sales ballooned to $165.2k for the month of July. Mount shared a 10% cut with the influencers — an amount that surpassed Morsell’s husband’s military check. Texts exchanged between Mount and Morsell (Craig Mount) Mount acknowledges that TikTok isn’t some magic bullet. Other food products — a candy company and a BBQ joint — tried their luck with the same influencers and didn’t see the same results. But he’s still bullish on the possibilities of the platform. “I can’t stress this enough: People are sleeping on TikTok,” says Mount. “People think it’s just a place where kids do stupid dances, but it’s really not. These influencers made the Fox News sales look like a joke.” The scarcity ‘feedback loop’ This explosion in sales upended Nerdy Nuts’ entire operation. Already facing a backlog, Mount and Peterson scrambled to expand: They bought 17 more PN1 peanut grinders. They hired a part-time staff of 25 people. They took over the lease at the kitchen they were sharing. They paid someone from O’Dang Hummus $9k to “deconstruct” their product line and optimize production to 4k jars per day. The stress that came with this hockey stick growth was overwhelming. “We had a very sweet setup before — a balanced lifestyle,” says Mount. “Then, suddenly, it’s just thousands of angry emails, and trying to keep everyone happy.” One thing that Mount and Peterson did to relieve dress: spend $8k on a full-body mascot, produced by the same company that makes them for NFL teams. This led Nerdy Nuts to make its next crucial decision: It closed its site and only opened up sales one day per week. “From a logistics standpoint, selling out was the worst thing that could’ve happened,” says Mount. “But from a marketing standpoint, it was the best thing ever.” Mount found that selling out created a lucrative “feedback loop”: It created an illusion of scarcity for those who didn’t get a jar. It made people who did get a jar feel exceptionally special. When Nerdy Nuts opened the site on that first Sunday, they made $80k in sales and had to shut it down again after just 2 minutes. Demand swamped supply, and customers began to grow irate. “People were calling me begging for peanut butter,” says Mount. “They’d say, ‘My family member just died and I NEED this,’ or ‘All I wanted in life was to share a jar with my newborn niece!’” Thousands of emails and Facebook comments poured in — some demanding that Mount and Peterson “get back in the kitchen and make more peanut butter.” Peterson with yet another huge order of supplies (Craig Mount) On eBay, an aftermarket sprouted up, with jars going for $40 a pop. Customers sent Mount photos of themselves sitting on their laptops every Sunday, waiting for the shop to open. “People have told me that getting a jar of Nerdy Nuts is like getting tickets to a Taylor Swift concert,” says Mount. The hype came with dividends: In August, Nerdy Nuts topped $505,862 in sales — a 20x increase from just a few months prior. Growing pains Ascending to $500k in sales in a matter of months may sound like a dream scenario. But Mount says the growth has put the company in a precarious position. To fully capitalize on his newfound success, Mount has had to form instantaneous partnerships with outside manufacturers and co-packers. “Insane growth puts you into bad relationships and shotgun weddings,” says Mount. “You have to trust people you have no time to properly evaluate.” They’ve also faced several pandemic-specific challenges: The nation’s largest peanut butter company, Jif, cleaned out the entire 16 oz. peanut butter jar supply, causing a shortage. Many peanut producers are struggling to meet increased demand. For the past few months, Mount has intentionally throttled his sales so he can catch up on backlogged orders. But the hype isn’t dying down: In September, Nerdy Nuts’ sales were $266k. October is on track to surpass that: One release alone — a “Cookies and Scream” flavor — netted the company $115k in one day, pushing its 2020 sales total over $1m. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Mount acknowledges that Nerdy Nuts’ “problems” are a bit of a “tiny violin” — especially in the larger context of a pandemic that has left millions of Americans unemployed. But he’s been wondering lately if the rapid virality of the business is more trouble than it’s worth. “We would’ve preferred to just grow slow and steady,” he says. Now 33, Mount is preoccupied with a different type of growth — that of his 2 young children. “I’d be happy to see this sell someday,” he says. “But if it all crashes and burns tomorrow, I’ll just go back to doing technical SEO.” Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Nerdy Nuts is based in Grand Rapids. The company is actually located in Rapid City. The error has been amended.

Here's how to leverage priorities, positive constraints, and psychology to avoid a long-term funk. By: Ethan Brooks | @damn_ethan October 24, 2020 Meet Bob. Like you, Bob thinks his job is to juggle things. He takes pride in being one of the best jugglers in the business: When someone asks him to throw an extra ball into his routine, he never says no. If he doesn’t have time to get something done during the workday, Bob is always willing to do it at night, in between bites of dinner. His day often begins at 8am and doesn’t end until 10pm. When he works late, he has the courtesy not to complain about it to his team (though he will occasionally hint at it). Bob’s managers think he’s one of the best employees at the company. They celebrate his juggling skills, tout his willingness to take on new projects, and tell other employees they should follow his example. What they don’t realize is that Bob is putting himself, his team, and even his entire company at risk. Because Bob is on the brink of burnout. Medical professionals define burnout as “a psychological state of physical and emotional exhaustion” thought to be induced by work-related stress. There are many theories as to what prompts burnout, but some of the more common job-related causes include: A lack of social support at work (especially common among remote workers) Extremes of activity, or burning the candle at both ends Unclear or undefined job expectations Work-life imbalance A Gallup survey found that 76% of employees have experienced some form of burnout. These employees are: 63% more likely to take a sick day than a non-affected worker 23% more likely to visit the emergency room 2.6x more likely to look fo a new job Bob has been teetering on the edge of burnout for a while. If he continues grinding himself down, he won’t just end up being nonproductive: He’ll become anti-productive, making mistakes that the rest of his team must spend time fixing. To make matters worse, Bob is now juggling all of his tasks from home, where it’s harder for his colleagues to gauge his stress levels. Luckily, Bob has a little furry friend named Hamster Jack, who just so happens to be a burnout expert. After years spent spinning around in the wheel of burnout, Hamster Jack knows just what it’s going to take to prevent Bob from fizzling out. And it all starts with defining what’s truly important. Priority: When everything is important, nothing is In Hamster Jack’s estimation, Bob’s first problem is that he thinks of his work in terms of priorities. Bob juggles a lot of different tasks and considers them all to be critically important. But the very idea of multiple “priorit-ies” (in the plural sense) is relatively new. A search through the world literature on Google N-Gram shows that the term “priorities” was practically nonexistent before the factory boom following World War II. Before that, only the singular version of the word — priority — was widely used. As Hamster Jack reminds Bob, the idea of multiple priorities is an illusion: Two things can be important, but they can’t both be the most important. When people say they have multiple priorities, what they’re really saying is that they have a hard time prioritizing. They are unwilling to make difficult, potentially uncomfortable decisions about what should take precedence over everything else. The first step to catching and reversing burnout before it does damage is learning to take time to figure out which proverbial balls are actually important — and which need to be dropped. Hamster Jack implores Bob to look at the things he’s juggling each day, and ask himself the following questions: Is this task still important, or has the situation changed? Often we commit to tasks or projects that are important at the time, but become less important as situations evolve. Am I really the only person who can do this? Many top performers think that doing something on their own is easier than teaching someone else how to do it. Trust your colleagues, and give them the chance to surprise you. Is this the most important thing right now? Or am I using it to avoid something else? Deep down, you know when you’re doing this. If this was the only thing I completed today, would I be satisfied with my day’s work? Part of avoiding burnout is focusing on work that will give us a sense of accomplishment. As Bob himself starts juggling fewer things, it clears space for him to focus. Positive constraints: Doing less to accomplish more On its own, prioritizing won’t prevent burnout. For someone like Bob, who’s grown accustomed to working nights and weekends, it doesn’t matter how much tasks are minimized: He’ll find ways to fill his time with more work. Hamster Jack senses that Bob is a victim of Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” The implication of this is simple, yet profound: To avoid working all the time — yet still get his work done — Bob needs to limit the amount of time he allots for work. Some companies and institutions have been experimenting with this very idea and seen positive results: A New Zealand firm tested a 4-day workweek and found that it actually boosted productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction. In 2019, Microsoft Japan closed their offices every Friday, and saw a ~39% increase in YoY sales per employee. A 23-month study in Sweden found that nurses who worked a 6-hour workday had higher productivity levels and lower absentee rates than those with a longer workday. But a mere “commitment” not to overwork won’t lead to sustainable change. In order for this constraint to work, Bob needs to face real, unmovable barriers that force him to finish his work and leave the office — like scheduling a long-overdue date with his love interest, Roberta. Psychology: The foundation for change Lastly, Hamster Jack knows that without the right psychological approach, Bob will quickly fall back onto the hamster wheel of burnout. Part of the problem stems from the common misconception that being a great employee means working hard. Hard work is part of the equation — but to be truly effective, Bob actually needs to do 2 things: Perform at the highest level Protect his ability to perform at the highest level Doing the first while neglecting the second is only setting Bob and his team up for more problems down the line. Hamster Jack — ever the fuzzy fountain of wisdom — suggests 2 rules to help him navigate his workday: 1. The 80% Rule As Hamster Jack is fond of saying, “There are two types of hamsters in this world: Those who give 110%, and those who understand math.” The 80% rule suggests that a superb employee plans to devote 80% of their energy and focus for the day to their job. The remaining 20% should be reserved for hobbies, family time, and everything else that isn’t work-related. By leaving some energy in the tank each day, Bob creates the space he needs to avoid toxic work-life imbalance. Still, Bob often feels guilty putting work away, which is why Hamster Jack shares another secret with him: 2. Diffuse Problem-Solving The brain has 2 modes of problem-solving: focused and diffuse. The focused mode, which is most familiar to us, is when we give our full attention to a problem and try to reason our way through it. It can be very effective — especially when the problem is relatively familiar. But the diffuse mode is where the problem-solving magic happens. This is when we allow our mind to wander, allowing it to connect disparate ideas at a level the focused mode doesn’t allow for. When Bob chose to step away from work and go live his life, he unlocked his mind’s ability to solve creative and complex problems. And in the end, this did more for his career, his team, and his company than a few extra hours of juggling.

By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett October 17, 2020 In August 2020, Craig Mount and Erika Peterson found themselves in an enviable position. Nerdy Nuts — the D2C peanut butter company they’d founded just 18 months earlier — had gone viral on TikTok. In the span of a few days, the couple had watched their sales multiply by 20x. But they didn’t have time to celebrate. They faced a backlog of $500k+ worth of orders, a depletion of inventory, and thousands of emails from cranky customers. What began as a tiny side hustle at a farmers market in South Dakota had ballooned into a monster. Nerdy Nuts’ journey is every entrepreneur’s dream: Create a cool product. Find a unique way to market it. Hack your way to expedited growth. It’s a case study in marketing, which touches on: The underutilized value of TikTok as an influencer tool The psychological power of scarcity The “Holy Grail” of a product feedback loop But it’s also a cautionary tale about the unglamorous underbelly of overnight success. From idea to farmers market The couple’s path into peanut butter began around 2015. At the time, Peterson was a clothing store manager at the Chapel Hills Mall in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Mount would often grab lunch at a nearby eatery that sold jars of flavored peanut butter. “The shop closed down and I thought, ‘Where do I get this stuff now?’” recalls Mount. “So I just decided to give it a shot on my own.” Peterson (left) and Mount (right), with their son (Craig Mount) In the summer of 2017, he logged on to eBay and bought a used Olde Tyme PN1 nut grinder for $870. But shortly after the purchase, the couple moved to Rapid City, South Dakota — and the machine ended up gathering dust in the garage. In early 2019, Peterson, then pregnant and on the hunt for a new gig, decided to finally put the grinder to use. That summer, she and Mount launched Nerdy Nuts (~$2.5k upfront investment in total) and began selling their first two flavors, honey roasted and white chocolate, at a local farmers market. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle The farmers market was the ideal focus group for a new product. “We spent hours and hours in front of live customers, whom we were able to see test out products in real time,” says Mount. “It became an excellent testing ground — and a perfect way for us to iterate.” By the end of the summer, Nerdy Nuts was the most popular booth at the farmers market, routinely bringing in ~$1k every Sunday. For Mount and Peterson, Nerdy Nuts was only intended to be a low-stress side hustle. Mount already made six-figures running an SEO consultancy, a job which monopolized most of his time. The couple was also raising a child — and another one was on the way. They weren’t looking to start a D2C peanut butter empire. But the market had other plans for their product. The takeoff Purely out of curiosity, Mount began spending some of his free time studying the niche world of peanut butter. He went on a voracious reading spree, learning about the history of modern peanut butter. He befriended members of the American Peanut Council, the industry’s largest trade group. He spent late nights Googling things like “how to affix a label without getting oil on it.” Through his research, Mount learned that nearly 60% of the $1.9B US peanut butter market is controlled by 2 companies: the J.M. Smucker Company (which owns Jif) and Hormel Foods (Skippy). But he also compiled a list of 127 smaller players, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, and saw a trend: Most were marketed as “healthy” or “keto-friendly.” He decided early on that Nerdy Nuts would focus more on flavor and fun. Back-of-the-notepad math Mount jotted down in the early stages (Craig Mount) Seeking advice on where to take the company, Mount posted in The Hustle’s Trends Facebook group, a community for entrepreneurs. In the group, he met a PR whiz named Adrian Salamunovic. Salamunovic was convinced that Nerdy Nuts could be the “Ben & Jerry’s of peanut butter” and advised Mount to double down on quirky marketing. One idea in particular stood out. Back in 2008, during the Obama-McCain election cycle, Airbnb had made $30k by selling cereal boxes themed after each candidate. Salamunovic suggested reprising the concept with peanut butter. In June 2019, Nerdy Nuts released a flavor for each candidate, based on his or her favorite food(s): Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Mount spent 40 hours cold-emailing 200+ reporters and got a bite from Fox Business. After landing a feature on the national talk show The Five, Nerdy Nuts got its first taste of virality. In the first 48 hours after the segment aired, the tiny company made $20k in sales. It was the company’s first taste of big success — and the business was woefully under-prepared for the bump. Their sole machine could only produce 60 jars of product per hour, and they were working out of a “dinky little kitchen” they’d rented from a local catering company. Joined by a rotating cast of family and friends, Mount and Peterson worked around the clock to tackle the influx of orders. Their garage became a temporary fulfillment center. “It was an overnight success story, but it was also super stressful,” says Mount. “You’re just thrown into this storm and you have no time to think.” Peterson receives a huge order of supplies (Craig Mount) The influx forced them to iterate their product: They switched from grinding nuts for each individual jar to grinding “batches” and filling multiple jars at once. They migrated their website from WooCommerce/Wordpress to Shopify — a decision that improved the checkout process and boosted order volume. They went all-in on D2C sales, as opposed to farmers’ markets or traditional retail. Running Nerdy Nuts as a direct-to-consumer business, the couple learned, came with microeconomic benefits. Traditional food brands that vie to get on retail shelves tend to follow a rule of one thirds when thinking about costs and profit: ⅓ = manufacturing costs (e.g., ingredients, production, labor) ⅓ = distribution costs (e.g., grocery store slotting and listing fees) ⅓ = retail profit But going the D2C route, Nerdy Nuts could avoid paying for distribution and reduce the retail price of its products. As a result, the company’s unit economics were better: A jar of Nerdy Nuts retailed for $11.99 and cost ~$5 to make, a gross margin of ~60% before other expenses. Higher order volume soon allowed them to buy in bulk and shave down costs even more. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle By the end of 2019, the couple had netted ~$60k in sales. As the business gained steam, Mount and Peterson grew a little apprehensive about the pace of acceleration. What was only intended to be a hobby was ballooning into a full-time job. Mount decided to just keep things fun and focus on storytelling. On the Nerdy Nuts site, Mount and Peterson focused on whimsy, listing a make-believe product called Unicorn Dust for $777.77. They went into a “heavy development period,” inventing and testing new flavors, like butterscotch, marshmallow, and toffee. Throughout most of early 2020, Nerdy Nuts hummed along at ~$8k/month in steady sales, buoyed, in part, by a wave of pandemic-related peanut butter panic-buying. But they never could’ve anticipated what the next few months had in store. The TikTok explosion In June 2020, Mount decided to test out peanut butter “product drops.” “Supreme clothing, or [Adidas] Yeezy sneakers, have these limited edition drops all the time,” says Mount. “I thought, ‘Why not do the same thing for peanut butter flavors?’” Nerdy Nuts dropped 3 new flavors — Monster Cookie, Oreo Cookie, and Circus Cookie — and turned to Instagram to market them. Nerdy Nuts product drops (Craig Mount) Mount got 18 influencers to peddle the peanut butter, but soon found them to be difficult to work with. “Once an Instagram influencer hits 10k followers, they think they’re some kid of celebrity,” he says. “They have price sheets and agents. They demand monthly retainers. They send you these BS proposals, promising x number of impressions.” The drops were popular and boosted Nerdy Nuts’ sales to $27k for the month of June. But only a fraction of those sales (107 jars) came from the Instagram influencers. Peterson had a suggestion: Why not try TikTok influencers instead? The couple reached out to two TikTokers: Ali Grace Morsell and Hailey Peters, both of whom had ~500k followers at the time. “It was a totally different response,” says Mount. “They were like, ‘OMG, you want to send me free peanut butter?!’ They were just so flabbergasted that anyone would want to send them something for free.” Astonishingly, videos posted by the TikTokers generated millions of views, resulting in 5,947 sales, and setting off a snowball effect. Nerdy Nuts sales ballooned to $165.2k for the month of July. Mount shared a 10% cut with the influencers — an amount that surpassed Morsell’s husband’s military check. Texts exchanged between Mount and Morsell (Craig Mount) Mount acknowledges that TikTok isn’t some magic bullet. Other food products — a candy company and a BBQ joint — tried their luck with the same influencers and didn’t see the same results. But he’s still bullish on the possibilities of the platform. “I can’t stress this enough: People are sleeping on TikTok,” says Mount. “People think it’s just a place where kids do stupid dances, but it’s really not. These influencers made the Fox News sales look like a joke.” The scarcity ‘feedback loop’ This explosion in sales upended Nerdy Nuts’ entire operation. Already facing a backlog, Mount and Peterson scrambled to expand: They bought 17 more PN1 peanut grinders. They hired a part-time staff of 25 people. They took over the lease at the kitchen they were sharing. They paid someone from O’Dang Hummus $9k to “deconstruct” their product line and optimize production to 4k jars per day. The stress that came with this hockey stick growth was overwhelming. “We had a very sweet setup before — a balanced lifestyle,” says Mount. “Then, suddenly, it’s just thousands of angry emails, and trying to keep everyone happy.” One thing that Mount and Peterson did to relieve dress: spend $8k on a full-body mascot, produced by the same company that makes them for NFL teams. This led Nerdy Nuts to make its next crucial decision: It closed its site and only opened up sales one day per week. “From a logistics standpoint, selling out was the worst thing that could’ve happened,” says Mount. “But from a marketing standpoint, it was the best thing ever.” Mount found that selling out created a lucrative “feedback loop”: It created an illusion of scarcity for those who didn’t get a jar. It made people who did get a jar feel exceptionally special. When Nerdy Nuts opened the site on that first Sunday, they made $80k in sales and had to shut it down again after just 2 minutes. Demand swamped supply, and customers began to grow irate. “People were calling me begging for peanut butter,” says Mount. “They’d say, ‘My family member just died and I NEED this,’ or ‘All I wanted in life was to share a jar with my newborn niece!’” Thousands of emails and Facebook comments poured in — some demanding that Mount and Peterson “get back in the kitchen and make more peanut butter.” Peterson with yet another huge order of supplies (Craig Mount) On eBay, an aftermarket sprouted up, with jars going for $40 a pop. Customers sent Mount photos of themselves sitting on their laptops every Sunday, waiting for the shop to open. “People have told me that getting a jar of Nerdy Nuts is like getting tickets to a Taylor Swift concert,” says Mount. The hype came with dividends: In August, Nerdy Nuts topped $505,862 in sales — a 20x increase from just a few months prior. Growing pains Ascending to $500k in sales in a matter of months may sound like a dream scenario. But Mount says the growth has put the company in a precarious position. To fully capitalize on his newfound success, Mount has had to form instantaneous partnerships with outside manufacturers and co-packers. “Insane growth puts you into bad relationships and shotgun weddings,” says Mount. “You have to trust people you have no time to properly evaluate.” They’ve also faced several pandemic-specific challenges: The nation’s largest peanut butter company, Jif, cleaned out the entire 16 oz. peanut butter jar supply, causing a shortage. Many peanut producers are struggling to meet increased demand. For the past few months, Mount has intentionally throttled his sales so he can catch up on backlogged orders. But the hype isn’t dying down: In September, Nerdy Nuts’ sales were $266k. October is on track to surpass that: One release alone — a “Cookies and Scream” flavor — netted the company $115k in one day, pushing its 2020 sales total over $1m. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Mount acknowledges that Nerdy Nuts’ “problems” are a bit of a “tiny violin” — especially in the larger context of a pandemic that has left millions of Americans unemployed. But he’s been wondering lately if the rapid virality of the business is more trouble than it’s worth. “We would’ve preferred to just grow slow and steady,” he says. Now 33, Mount is preoccupied with a different type of growth — that of his 2 young children. “I’d be happy to see this sell someday,” he says. “But if it all crashes and burns tomorrow, I’ll just go back to doing technical SEO.” Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Nerdy Nuts is based in Grand Rapids. The company is actually located in Rapid City. The error has been amended. Shameless plug: Craig and Erika built Nerdy Nuts with the aid of Trends — a community of entrepreneurs who help each other launch awesome companies. Give it a spin for just $1 here.

By: Trung T. Phan | @TrungTPhan November 10, 2020 I’ve been instructed by my editor to stop making jokes about a certain South African entrepreneur. So, you’ll have to put your thinking hats on for this next sentence: A certain electrical vehicle maker that rhymes with “Resla” released its own tequila last week. The “Resla” tequila sold out immediately, following in the footsteps of a previous “Resla” short shorts apparel drop. Is there anything this EV car company can’t sell? We can’t know for sure, but let’s dig through corporate history’s worst brand extension mistakes to see where the limits might be: Harley-Davidson cologne: In 2019, Harley-Davidson sold ~$238m in merch (~5.2% of revenue). Not among the sales: a failed cologne from the mid-1990s that cost $60 a bottle, with names like Black Fire, Destiny, and Hot Rod. Apple’s game console project: In partnership with Japanese game maker Bandai, Apple released the Pippin. It cost 2-3x more than other consoles and only sold 42k units (vs. 350k Nintendos in the first 3 days after the N64 console was released in 1996). DuPont made a shoe (LOL): On a mission to make a leather substitute, the chemical giant created Corfam. DuPont spent $100m to make the material and for some reason decided that dress shoes were the move. Corfam had basically zero breathability, and stank feet was almost certainly a problem. If “Resla” can do high heels, it’s game over. Related Posts Recent Posts Brief ESPN is pivoting to subscriptions. Will it work? By Trung T. Phan / November 13, 2020 Touchdown dance ...

Phan | @TrungTPhan December 10, 2020 Less than 2 months ago, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) smacked Google with an antitrust case. In perhaps the greatest “hold my beer” ever, another government agency — the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — just launched an antitrust case of its own against Facebook. And, unlike the Google case, this case is aiming for a breakup of its Big Tech target, according to the New York Times. More than 40 states will join in on the lawsuit The meat of the case concerns Facebook’s history of buying on-the-rise social apps, snuffing out future competition and reducing the end users’ experience. Of particular note are Facebook’s acquisitions of: Instagram for $1B in 2012 WhatsApp for $19B 2014 Today, Facebook is a $790B+ behemoth with annual revenue of $80B+ and 4 products that boast 1B+ users: Facebook (2.7B), WhatsApp (2B), Messenger (1.3B), Instagram (1.1B). Few major antitrust cases have tried to unwind previous mergers One of Facebook’s defenses is the very fact that the FTC approved these mergers years ago. Facebook further contends that without its infrastructure and social expertise, the likes of Instagram and WhatsApp would not have seen the same growth. In more recent years, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has latched onto TikTok as an argument against a breakup of Facebook: First, the video app’s hockey stick rise proves that social media remains competitive. Second, Facebook is a defense against the rise of social apps from China, a country which has a “dangerous” approach to internet regulation, according to Zuckerberg. Prosecutors want to break up Facebook and block future deals These are “some of the most severe penalties regulators can demand” according to the New York Times. The case — which took 18 months to put together — will likely take years to resolve. Somewhat ironically, Facebook announced a $1B acquisition of chatbot startup Kustomer last week. If the FTC wins this deal, the period of freewheeling Big Tech M&A may come to an end.

Google: What you need to know The US Government v. Google: What you need to know The US government’s lawsuit against Google alleges the firm is abusing its monopoly position in search and search advertising. What’s next? By: Trung T. Phan | @TrungTPhan October 21, 2020 Finally, we can party like it’s 1998. In the biggest US tech antitrust action since the government took on Microsoft and Bill “Don’t call me Dollar Bill” Gates, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday. What’s the allegation? According to the Wall Street Journal, Justice officials will lay out the case that Google is abusing monopoly positions in search (~80% of US search volume) and search advertising. The DOJ claims the company is acting as a gatekeeper and shutting out competition by: Paying browsers billions of dollars to be the default search engine Pre-loading its search app (which can’t be deleted) on Android phones Preventing competing search pre-loads on phones under revenue-share agreements Owning industry-leading tools at every part of the digital advertising chain Predictably, Google has called the suit “deeply flawed.” The stakes are huge A similar investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in 2013 never made it to court. But the DOJ suit could set a huge precedent: A loss for Google could change the structure of its business, (e.g., a potential spinoff of the Chrome browser). A win for Google would hamper DC’s efforts to wrangle other antitrust targets (Amazon, Apple, Facebook). Don’t expect anything overnight, though. It took 3 years to reach an agreement with Microsoft. Google will be deploying its some of its $120B in cash to fight this case As we previously covered, the company has a ready-made defense. The US government recently sued American Express for charging merchants high fees, but the payments firm won the case by saying it was a “net positive” across its entire network (e.g., customers get points). Google certainly has a claim. One study showed that consumers would have to be paid $17.5k a year to give up search. Either way, this brings back memories of 1998. One other thing that happened that year? Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google.

Google: What you need to know The US Government v. Google: What you need to know The US government’s lawsuit against Google alleges the firm is abusing its monopoly position in search and search advertising. What’s next? By: Trung T. Phan | @TrungTPhan October 21, 2020 Finally, we can party like it’s 1998. In the biggest US tech antitrust action since the government took on Microsoft and Bill “Don’t call me Dollar Bill” Gates, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday. What’s the allegation? According to the Wall Street Journal, Justice officials will lay out the case that Google is abusing monopoly positions in search (~80% of US search volume) and search advertising. The DOJ claims the company is acting as a gatekeeper and shutting out competition by: Paying browsers billions of dollars to be the default search engine Pre-loading its search app (which can’t be deleted) on Android phones Preventing competing search pre-loads on phones under revenue-share agreements Owning industry-leading tools at every part of the digital advertising chain Predictably, Google has called the suit “deeply flawed.” The stakes are huge A similar investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in 2013 never made it to court. But the DOJ suit could set a huge precedent: A loss for Google could change the structure of its business, (e.g., a potential spinoff of the Chrome browser). A win for Google would hamper DC’s efforts to wrangle other antitrust targets (Amazon, Apple, Facebook). Don’t expect anything overnight, though. It took 3 years to reach an agreement with Microsoft. Google will be deploying its some of its $120B in cash to fight this case As we previously covered, the company has a ready-made defense. The US government recently sued American Express for charging merchants high fees, but the payments firm won the case by saying it was a “net positive” across its entire network (e.g., customers get points). Google certainly has a claim. One study showed that consumers would have to be paid $17.5k a year to give up search. Either way, this brings back memories of 1998. One other thing that happened that year? Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google.

What does it mean to short a stock? An illustrated guide to short selling, short squeezes, and the future of contrarian investing. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett February 6, 2021 Late last month, a truly bizarre scene unfolded in the market. GameStop ($GME) — a stock that began the year trading at ~$17 per share — rocketed up to $483, then came crashing back down to Earth a few days later. The saga began when a bunch of hedge funds (“hedgies”) heavily speculated that GameStop would plummet. The hedgies’ idea was to short the stock –– or bet against its future success. Their plan was foiled when Redditors and newly minted day traders snapped up millions of shares, momentarily sending the beleaguered consumer electronics retailer “to the moon.” Short selling can be a bit hard to wade through, especially for new investors. So in this explainer, we’ll touch on the following: How short selling works How a “short squeeze” can threaten the strategy How recent events might affect the future of short selling Stocks are a non-physical asset and can be a little hard to conceptualize. So, to explain this, let’s imagine that a share of stock is a physical object — say a lamp — that is currently worth $100. Now, let’s start with what a typical investor does This is Monty. He just really likes this lamp and he thinks that it’ll go UP in price. So, he buys it at the current market price ($100) and holds onto it until that day comes. This is called going “long.” Zachary Crockett / The Hustle For Monty, this investment will end in one of two ways: The lamp will increase in value → he’ll gain a profit The lamp will decrease in value → he’ll absorb a loss He thinks that “lamps only go up,” so he’s bullish about the future. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle But what if an investor thinks the lamp is going to go DOWN in value and wants to hedge a bet against it? Here’s where short selling comes in Let’s say there’s another dude named Melvin. Unlike Monty, Melvin thinks the lamp is way overpriced at $100, and speculates that the market for this ugly thing is due for a big correction in the future. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Short selling is a bit more advanced than a typical stock transaction. To do it, an investor has to have something called a margin account that lets him borrow against his investments. It’s high-risk, high-reward — and usually, only more seasoned traders with lots of capital (e.g. hedgies) screw around with it. But in simple terms, here’s how it works: Melvin borrows* a lamp from a lamp broker Melvin immediately sells the lamp at the current market rate Melvin sets a date for when he thinks the price will go down Melvin buys back the lamp for a lower price Melvin gives the lamp back to his broker Melvin pockets the difference * Borrowed shares usually come from a broker’s own inventory, or from the account of one of the broker’s other traders. In return for the loan, a short seller pays the broker interest and commission fees. If the price of the lamp goes down before Melvin has to return the lamp to the broker, his short works out perfectly. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle But what happens if the value of the lamp goes UP? Let’s go back to Monty, our traditional “long” investor. The lowest the lamp can go to is $0 — so the maximum amount he can lose is the $100 he originally invested. By contrast, Melvin’s risk is infinite. In theory, there is no limit to how high a lamp’s price can go. It might 10x in price, and he’ll be responsible for paying the broker back before the expiration date. This uncapped ceiling can be a big threat to short sellers like Melvin. Imagine that Melvin and a bunch of his friends decide to short lamps. They all borrow lamps from their brokers, sell them for $100 apiece, and speculate that the price will drop to $50. But then Elon Musk Tweets out a photo of a leg lamp in a SpaceX shuttle and it suddenly becomes the hottest buy in America. The price of a leg lamp skyrockets to $200. Melvin and all his buddies begin to realize the price won’t drop by their expiration date, so they panic and start buying back lamps at a loss to pay back their brokers before things get even worse. The influx of short sellers buying into the market drives the price of lamps up even more — $500 … $800 … $1k! This dreaded event is called a short squeeze. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle (Musk smoking weed: The Joe Rogan Experience, via YouTube) A short sqeeze ends up being terrible for Melvin, who anticipated a big dip in the lamp market. Conversely, it’s a major payday for an investor like Monty, who believed in the future of his lamp. The heights his lamp reaches in the squeeze exceed anything he ever initially dreamed of. The future of the short So, how does this all tie back in with what happened to GameStop and other “meme stocks” last month? Here’s a simplified review: A bunch of Wall Street folks shorted GameStop stock. A bunch of retail investors and Reddit users gobbled up GameStop stock, causing an artificial spike in price. Short sellers scrambled to get out, causing a short squeeze. Like most short squeezes, the boom was short-lived and the stock came tumbling back down to pre-squeeze levels. In the end, a few shorters got badly burned — most seriously, Melvin Capital, which lost ~$4.5B (53% of its assets) and had to be bailed out by a fellow hedgie. On the other side, some Redditors and retail traders made handsome “tendies” by riding the squeeze. But most of those who got in late (including Barstool’s Dave Portnoy) either ended up deep in the red, or have pledged to hold to the grave. The situation has cast yet more doubt on the efficient market hypothesis — the idea that stock prices are rooted in the actual inherent value, based on available information. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle (@zzcrockett) And what could this mean for the future of short selling? Many analysts are predicting that the GameStop epic will result in: More bubbles, fueled by hype in online communities and the accessibility of trading apps. Less short selling, as investment firms shy away from the volitility these bubbles could create. Some short selling firms have already reevaluated their entire strategy. The prominent short seller Citron Research — run by a man who has described himself as a patroller of “fraudulent and over-hyped stocks” — recently announced that it will cease publication of its flagship short reports and shift to “multibagger opportunities for individual investors.” One thing is certain: Melvin will be thinking twice about speculating on his next lamp.

What’s going on? By: Trung T. Phan | @TrungTPhan January 26, 2021 If you’re stonking, GameStop ($GME) has been an unmissable sight in recent months. The video game retailer — which has seen its stock rise more than 20x since March lows — is currently an epic battleground stock, pitting Reddit day traders vs. legacy hedge funds. Bloomberg has a fantastic rundown: $GME was first pitched as an investment on r/WallStreetBets about 2 years ago, but the current craze built up over the past 12 months. Members on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets believed that GameStop, with 5k+ brick ‘n’ mortar locations, could turn around its fortunes by going digital. On Aug. 31, 2020, Ryan Cohen — the billionaire founder of pet company Chewy — bought up a big position in $GME (he now owns 10%+ of it) with plans to modernize the company. In the months since, a number of prominent hedge funds (Citron, Melvin Capital) revealed they were betting against (AKA short selling) $GME. Typically in short selling, you: 1) borrow a stock; 2) sell it to a buyer; and 3) if the price of the stock falls, you can buy it for a cheaper price you sold it at and return the stock to the person who lent it to you. One risk of short selling is called a “short squeeze.” Since you have to eventually return the stock you borrowed, problems can arise if there is a limited supply of the stock. In a “short squeeze,” the underlying stock will get bid up as short sellers try to get their hands on stock that they have to return. Options trading — the right, but not obligation, to buy a stock at a certain price — is also driving $GME up as institutions that sell these options are buying $GME stock to hedge their position. $GME stock is on an upward tear as these market mechanics play out and r/WallStreetBets traders coordinate their efforts. Over the past 2 trading days, $GME is up +79%. We have no idea how this will play out, but do know which subreddit will have updates. *** UPDATE: Tuesday, January 26th, 2021 GameStop update because LOLZ Yesterday, we talked about the GameStop ($GME), the video game store that has become a meme stock favorite on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets (WSB) and pitted retail investors vs. traditional hedge funds. We (really) need to update you: One of the hedge funds (Melvin Capital) betting against $GME has lost so much money that 2 other hedge funds (Citadel, Point72) put up $2.8B to prop it up. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya (AKA the SPAC-man) got into the mix and backed $GME with a $100k options bet. On Tuesday, $GME skyrocketed, gaining +92%. For the WSB crowd, the cherry on top of the cake was a tweet from Elon Musk — noted hater of short sellers — in support of $GME and WSB: “Gamestonk!!” $GME was up another +42% after hours following the tweet. In layman’s terms: $GME was trading under $4 in March 2020 and, as of 9pm EST on Tuesday, it was at $209. Absolutely bonkers stonkers! *** UPDATE: Wednesday, January 27th, 2021 How Reddit (and GameStop) changed finance The GameStop saga continues, pitting retail traders of the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets against traditional hedge funds (which, by one calculation, have lost a collective $25B short-selling $GME). Memes aside, this drama has real structural implications for the finance industry. A few of them, per Bloomberg’s Cormac Mullen and Tracy Alloway: Trading flows are more important than fundamentals: In the Before Times, an investing edge was obtained through deep spreadsheet analysis. But with the rise of trading apps, the actual flow of money itself is a stronger determining factor in stock price. Options trading is an “affordable” way to move markets: Options are the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a stock at a certain price. What this means is that someone can bet on a stock for less than they would if they bought it outright. Despite a lower upfront cash outlay, options can still move the market because the financial institutions selling the options have to hedge their position by buying up the underlying stock. Short-sellers are the target: In Before Times, hedge funds used to write up long reports and make big splashy announcements for why they were shorting a stock. Now, if a hedge fund reveals a short position, it can become a target of the r/WallStreetBets crowd. *** UPDATE: Friday, January 29th, 2021 Honestly, we tried not to write about GameStop ($GME) today, but this story is absolutely bonkers (seriously, when is the Michael Lewis book coming)? If you want to catch up on how this saga has pitted Reddit day traders against fat-cat hedge funds, we’ve got you covered here. On to the updates: In addition to $GME, traders following the r/WallStreetBets subreddit have been piling into AMC ($AMC), Blackberry ($BB), and Nokia ($NOK). At market open on Thursday, all of these stocks took a beating, and Robinhood — among the most popular trading apps for Redditors — restricted trading in $AMC and $GME (only allowing them to close out positions). Robinhood’s tactics were so questionable lawmakers from both sides (AOC + Ted Cruz) dunked on the app…but don’t expect that unlikely pair to be working together on a bill anytime soon. One hedge fund — D1 Capital — is among the biggest losers betting against r/WallStreetBets and also just so happens to be one of Robinhood’s biggest investors. Users have filed lawsuits against Robinhood for restricting trading in $GME (incredibly, more than half of Robinhood users have exposure to the stock). In response, Robinhood says it restricted trading in response to SEC capital requirements. It also said it would allow limited trading of some restricted names — $GME and $AMC both jumped 40%+ after hours on the news. Senator Elizabeth Warren lashed out at the SEC, saying ““We need an SEC that has clear rules about market manipulation and then has the backbone to get in and enforce those rules.” This story is very far from over and we’ll have more on Monday.

How are bitcoin created? An illustrated guide to bitcoin mining, blockchains, and the “minting” process of cryptocurrency’s most popular coin. By: Zachary Crockett | @zzcrockett February 14, 2021 Bitcoin has had a banner start to the year. Less than 2 months after breaking the $20k barrier for the first time, the digital currency more than doubled in price, hitting a high of $49,344 this week. Every time bitcoin is proclaimed to be dead, it seems to surge back, buoyed by bullish investors, favorable legislation, and tech titans’ tweets. At this point, nearly everyone has heard of bitcoin. But many folks still don’t quite understand how the currency is created. It’s not printed like cash. It’s not a physical object like a gold bar. It’s not stored on a piece of plastic like a debit card. It just exists somewhere in a vast digital expanse until it’s excavated into circulation by a so-called bitcoin miner. In this illustrated guide, we’ll cover the following: How bitcoin is created (a process called mining) How the economics of mining have changed over time The effects this process has on power consumption The digital miner To help explain all of this, we’d like to introduce you to a man named Willy “Wild Eyes” Tibbs. Wild Eyes made a fortune in the California Gold Rush in 1849. Now — 170 years later — he’s back from the grave for his next prospecting adventure. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Wild Eyes has heard that there are riches to be made in mining a newfangled digital resource called bitcoin. As he sees it, bitcoin shares a few similarities with gold: There’s a finite supply: As dictated by bitcoin’s creator, there can only ever be 21m total coins. They must be mined: The only way to release new bitcoin into circulation is through the efforts of digital excavators. Wild Eyes digs a little deeper and finds out that bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 by an elusive pioneer (or group of pioneers) under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto’s mission was to create a decentralized currency system that wasn’t beholden to middlemen. Among it’s touted benefits: It’s democratic: Unlike paper money, where a single central authority like a bank manages a record of all transactions, bitcoin is minted, circulated, and audited by thousands of users. It’s harder to manipulate: Government agencies can’t intercede by doing things like increasing volume or fiddling with interest rates. It’s global: Someone in Tennessee can instantaneously trade bitcoin with someone across the globe in Tokyo at a low cost. The backbone of this concept is a distributed network called the blockchain, where a record of all bitcoin transactions is stored. Now, for an old-school argonaut like Wild Eyes, this is a tad complicated. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle To help him out, let’s step back a bit and briefly explain the blockchain using something he can understand: a choo-choo train. Imagine that the blockchain is a loooong train — a blocktrain, if you will. This train contains a public record of all bitcoin transactions. Each time a trade is made through a cryptocurrency platform like Coinbase, the details of the transaction are coded and broadcast, along with other transactions, to a vast network of users called bitcoin miners. From there, the following process unfolds: Miners compete to add the next car to the train by bundling up a bunch of transactions into “blocks.” Miners solve a computational problem (called “proof of work”) that assigns the block an identifying code (a hash). The “winning” block is distributed to, and verified by, all the other miners in the network and is added to the blockchain. Only one car can be added to the train at any given time, and each one takes ~10 minutes on average to verify and attach. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle These bitcoin miners serve 2 major functions: They are the printing press of bitcoin: Adding new blocks to the blockchain is the only way to release new bitcoin into circulation. They are the auditors of bitcoin: Through the process of mining, they verify the legitimacy of all transactions on the blockchain. By solving the equation first and adding the next block to the chain, a miner is rewarded with a set amount of bitcoin. When bitcoin mining first started, the reward was 50 bitcoin (BTC). But as dictated by the coin’s creator, the reward is cut in half every time 210k new blocks are added to the chain — or roughly every 4 years. As of February 2021, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for every new block they mine — or ~$294k based on the current market value. They also get to keep the transaction fees from the trades in that block, which are currently around $20/trade. Today, it’s estimated that there are more than 1m bitcoin miners in operation — and they’re all competing to add the next block to the chain. Combined, the rewards these miners earn top $1B per month. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle On paper, these numbers make mining an extremely appealing pursuit for folks like Wild Eyes. But as it turns out, the money’s not so easy to come by. The bitcoin mining arms race As mentioned above, a bitcoin miner has to solve a computational problem in order to successfully add a new block to the blockchain and receive his reward. We won’t get into the nitty-gritty of that problem here (check out this post for a full breakdown on the math). But in simple terms, a miner basically has to employ a computer to run through trillions of hexadecimal number combinations until it spits out an acceptable 64-character code. This coding keeps the blockchain secure. The difficulty of this problem adjusts in proportion to the network’s total mining power: As more bitcoin miners join the network to compete, the problem becomes harder to solve, thus requiring even more computing power. This led to something of a bitcoin mining arms race. A decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoin using a simple computer processor. But as mining began to spread, people utilized more powerful hardware like GPUs (graphics processing units), FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), and dedicated ASIC mining machines. The volume of miners on the network — and the random nature of number generation — has made winning a block reward into a lottery. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Bitcoin miners have to weigh the cost of hardware (and more importantly, the cost of the electricity required to run it) against the slim odds of winning on a regular basis. In most cases, operating alone is no longer financially viable. Let’s say Wild Eyes bought an old ASIC machine — say an Antminer s9 (~$400 on eBay) — and rigged it up in his basement. According to bitcoin mining calculators, it would likely take him 225 years to generate a block. And while sitting around waiting for that to happen, he’d spend ~$3.50 per day (~$1.3k per year) on electricity just for the one machine. For this reason, today’s bitcoin mining scene is dominated by 2 factions: Mining pools: Groups of individual miners who combine their computing power, then divide any rewards up proportionally, based on how much computing power each person contributed Massive mining “farms” that have thousands of machines running 24/7 Around 66% of the world’s bitcoin mining now happens in China, where cheap hardware makes large operations more economically feasible. In Dalian — China’s bitcoin mining capital — one factory alone mines 750 bitcoin per month, or $35.6m in value at the current market rate. To do so, it utilizes 3k+ ASIC machines and spends $1m+ per month on electricity. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Averaging across all types of operations, one bitcoin costs between $5k and $8.5k to mine. Power makes up the vast majority of the overhead. The key for many mine operators is to plunk down where electricity costs are especially cheap — places like Iceland, upstate New York, small towns in Washington State, and rural Texas. But power consumption isn’t just an economic consideration, it’s one of the biggest controversies in the practice of bitcoin mining. The power problem Collectively, bitcoin miners use 121.4 terawatt-hours (tWh) of electricity per year to sustain their operations. To give that number some additional context, that’s enough to power the entire population of Argentina (45m) for an entire year. Zachary Crockett / The Hustle Of course, traditional financial institutions aren’t much better. It has been estimated that the world’s banks collectively consume at least 100 tWh of power per year, when factoring in branches, servers, ATM machines, and paperwork. Eventually, though, the power used by miners will be a moot point. Roughly 18.6m (88.5%) of the possible 21m bitcoin have already been mined. At the current rate, the final bitcoin is projected to be mined in the year 2140. Most of the gold, so to speak, has been snatched from the streams. So ol’ Wild Eyes may be better off just buying bitcoin on the open market.
