This glossary provides definitions for the various types of news and opinion content and, following that, for the various forms of paid content published online and in the newspaper. Drawing a clear line between news and opinion has long been one of the Toronto Star's core values. Broadly defined, news is based on the impartial reporting of facts while opinion is based on personal interpretation and the judgement of facts. NEWS News content is verified information based on the impartial reporting of facts, either observed by the reporter or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. News reports do not include the opinion of the author. NEWS TERMS Analysis: A critical or contextual examination of an important and topical issue based on factual reporting. It provides an explanation of the impact or meaning of news events and draws on the authority and expertise of the writer. Analysis articles do not contain the author’s opinions. Investigation: In-depth reporting in the public interest that reveals wrongdoing and/or systemic problems that holds those in power accountable and promotes positive change. Explainer: Journalism that provides readers with the background knowledge they need to help them understand the how and why of events or issues.

Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views, subject to standards of taste and laws of libel including views directly contrary to the editorial views of the Star. OPINION TERMS Editorial: An article that presents a point of view reflecting the news organization's position on an issue of public interest. Editorials are not meant to be a neutral presentation of the facts. They are written by journalists who are expressing the view of the news organization.

Opinion articles include columns written by staff and commentary from non-staff contributors. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views including views directly contrary to the news organization's editorial views, as long as they fall within the boundaries of taste and laws of libel.

The study — by experts from Texas A&M University, the University of Texas at Austin, University of California and California Institute of Technology — compared transmission of the virus and preventative measures in New York City and Italy, where mask-wearing became mandatory part way through the pandemic. They found that after masks were required, New York reduced infections by 66,000 from April 17 to May 9. In Italy, they were reduced by 78,000 from April 6 to May 9. “What we believe is that if you impose the use of face masks and you do it properly, it is potentially a way to control the pandemic,” said Mario Molina, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, who shared the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1995. In charting the number of cases in New York City and Italy over time, Molina said the line was headed straight up until it began to bend on the exact day that mandatory mask policies came into effect. “It is extremely clear that it is much more important to make the use of masks mandatory than just isolating and social distancing, (because) you can decrease cases much more efficiently,” Molina said. Unlike social distancing, masks protect against inhaling droplets as well as virus-bearing aerosols, which can hang in the air for hours, added Molina, lead author of the study along with Renyi Zhang, a distinguished professor in atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M. Molina said an upcoming study that compares the impact of wearing masks in U.S. states where they have been mandated shows the same clear pattern, and he believes it should be compulsory in all public settings until the virus is wiped out. The peer-reviewed study was published in the National Academy of Sciences journal in the U.S. Some scientists though, have criticized the methodology used by the authors, including Kate Grabowski, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. The journal has not commented publicly about the paper. In Ontario, meanwhile, more than 200 doctors have signed an open letter from #Masks4Canada asking for mandatory face coverings in places where it’s impossible to social distance — including public transit and any indoor space outside the home. The TTC announced this past week that masks would become mandatory for transit users as of July 2. But the province did not adopt the requirement when it announced stage two of its reopening, which means people can socialize without masks on restaurant patios in some parts of Ontario, as well as gather in groups of 10, as long as they socially distance. Premier Doug Ford said it’s up to municipalities to mandate masks, which they have the right to do under section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act when there is the immediate risk of an outbreak of a communicable disease. Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, issued the order soon after the stage two reopening was announced, requiring businesses in the area to prohibit customers who aren’t wearing masks. That health unit has “ongoing modest evidence of community transmission” of the virus, but Mercer added there were signs of physical distancing fatigue and declining mask use within the businesses that had remained open. “As more commercial establishments (and other amenities) in our region open under Phase 2, it was important to look at all measures that can be implemented to keep the population safe while supporting the reopening of the economy” until there’s a vaccine, Mercer said in an email.

The California study was the second on the subject this month. A British paper published last week found that if 50 per cent or more of the population routinely wore face masks — even homemade — the reproduction number of the virus would dip below one, referring to the average number of secondary infections for each person who has COVID-19. “If widespread face mask use by the public is combined with physical distancing and some lockdown, it may offer an acceptable way of managing the pandemic and reopening economic activity long before there is a working vaccine,” according to a statement by Dr. Richard Stutt, lead author of the British study, who works in Cambridge’s plant sciences department where he normally models the spread of crop diseases. In New Brunswick, residents are required to wear masks wherever social distancing can’t be practised, but the province scrapped a requirement for public buildings one day after it was implemented.

More than 60% of commercial flights in and out of Beijing have been cancelled as the city limits travel in and out of the city, especially from districts where new cases have been detected. The website of the Communist Party’s Global Times said that as of 9 a.m. Wednesday, a total of 1,255 flights to and from the capital’s two major airports have been scrapped. Beijing said it had essentially eradicated local transmission but in recent days has added 137 cases in the city of 20 million people. On Wednesday, the capital reported 31 cases, up from 27 the day before, in an outbreak that has been primarily linked to a wholesale food market. Nationwide, China reported 44 new cases, around the average for recent days. No new deaths were reported and just 252 people are currently in treatment for COVID-19. In Beijing, visitor numbers at museums, libraries and galleries will be capped at 30% of capacity while sporting events are being suspended along with other large group activities. Meetings can be held under stringent conditions with less than 100 participants. Group tourism across city and provincial borders is suspended, adding to bans on residents from high-risk areas from leaving Beijing and bans on taxis and car-hailing services from transporting people across the city border. Mask wearing, social distancing and disinfecting will all be more tightly enforced. Checks at the entrance to residential communities are also being tightened. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region: — India added 2,003 deaths to its toll Wednesday after New Delhi and Maharashtra states included 1,672 unreported fatalities. Adding the unreported fatalities drove India’s fatality rate, defined as the proportion of death to the total number of cases, from 2.9% to 3.4%. The Health Ministry also reported 10,974 new coronavirus cases. Its national caseload of more than 354,000 is fourth highest in the world. Its death toll is eighth highest. Health experts have warned that the country was undercounting fatalities. Some states used varying criteria to categorize their dead, and the numbers are though to be higher for other reasons common around the world, such as limited testing. — Indonesia has overtaken Singapore as the country which has the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia, after it reported 1,031 new cases in the last 24 hours. Indonesian has now recorded 41,431 total COVID-19 cases and 2,276 deaths. More than 16,000 patients have recovered. Nevertheless, the government is moving forward with plans to restart some tourism. — South Korea has reported 43 new cases of COVID-19 as health authorities scramble to slow transmissions in the greater capital area amid increased public activity. The figures released by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday brought its caseload to 12,198 infections, including 279 deaths. The KCDC said 25 new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, where infections have been linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings, e-commerce workers and door-to-door salespeople. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern assigned a top military leader to oversee New Zealand’s border quarantine measures. She made the move after what she described as an “unacceptable failure” by health officials in allowing two travellers to leave quarantine before they had been tested for the virus. After the women tested positive, officials began contacting 320 people who may have come into contact with them. Before the two new cases were announced Tuesday, New Zealand had gone more than three weeks without reporting any new cases and was considered virus-free. Air Commodore Digby Webb, the assistant chief of defence, will oversee all quarantine and managed isolation facilities. — Thailand’s leader says the country is beginning to see “the light at the end of the tunnel” in its fight against COVID-19 but is some distance away from being able to declare total victory. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Wednesday in a televised speech that Thailand has been recognized for controlling the spread of the coronavirus and was now relaxing as many restrictions as possible, but had to stay alert against a second wave of the disease. “We must be extremely careful, continuing to wear masks, practicing social distancing and hand hygiene, and generally being careful about gathering together,” he said. Thai authorities earlier in the day announced no new cases of the disease, leaving the country’s total at 3,135 with 58 deaths.

Payne said in a university speech that the disinformation contributed to a “climate of fear and division” when the world needed co-operation and understanding. She referred to a Europe Union finding that Russia and China are flooding Europe with disinformation campaigns. China has warned its citizens about racism in Australia and made trade moves recently that are widely regarded as punishment for Australia’s advocacy for an independent inquiry into the origins and responses to the pandemic. — A Philippine anti-graft prosecutor said his agency will investigate the Department of Health and its top officials over what he said was their mishandling of the response to the pandemic that led to the deaths of medical personnel. Ombudsman Samuel Martires said investigators will look into possible criminal liabilities for Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and other officials over delays in the procurement of protective suits and other lapses that led to the death of several doctors and other medical personnel. The department said it will co-operate in the investigation.

She was looking for someone: The man who worked there, who she said felt up her daughter. She wanted to know if he was somehow still employed, despite her daughter Brandi Reale and three other waitresses filing complaints with management about inappropriate touching. Morgenweg was there with her ex-husband and his girlfriend, and while eating she decided to “play tourist” and take some photos of the restaurant’s colourful characters and scenery. Seven days later she received a letter from Rainforest Cafe owners Falls Avenue Resort — a division of Canadian Niagara Hotels — that she was banned for life from the properties. Not just the restaurant, but nearly 20 other properties owned by the company, including the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Hard Rock Cafe and two levels of Casino Niagara. “If you set foot on the aforementioned properties you will be arrested,” the letter stated. She couldn’t believe what she was reading. “Are you kidding me?” said the Welland resident, who doesn’t know how the company even obtained her name or address. “I was more in shock at the beginning.” Now, she’s angry. About 95 employees of Rainforest Cafe, including Reale, have been on strike since April 7, and are citing sexual harassment on the job as a key concern as they fight for a first contract. Canadian Niagara Hotels said Morgenweg went to the restaurant that night with the purpose of photographing Rainforest Cafe staff members who do not support the strike. “These photos are then used to intimidate staff,” said a statement sent to The Review on Friday. “Staff complained, as they felt threatened and pressured not to come to work. Despite these tactics, most staff still chose to work rather than strike.” Reale, 24, has worked at the Clifton Hill St. restaurant for four years. She says during her shift on March 31, a co-worker came to her saying a male employee hired about a month earlier had touched her in an “uncomfortable” way. “She described it as, he would come up behind her, touch her lower back and kind of drop his hand to touch her butt,” Reale said. “As the shift went on, she mentioned he had done it more than once.” Shortly after, she said she experienced it firsthand when he came up behind her. “At the moment, I just kind of walked away — I didn’t know what to do,” she said. “After, I went to talk to (my co-worker) and said, ‘It wasn’t an accident, he definitely did it on purpose. He did it to me, we have to go talk to management.’ ” They both filed complaints and finished their shifts. A few days went by, with the male employee not seen, before the waitresses were approached by the manager. They were told the employee felt “really bad about what he did, he was very remorseful.” “I kind of thought about it after, and I was like, ‘Shouldn’t they be talking to us to see how we feel? Are you guys OK, are you comfortable to come back to work?’ ” ” Get more of what matters in your inbox Start your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

I didn’t do any of this on purpose.’ “Basically, it wasn’t an apology . . . it was like, ‘I didn’t do anything.’ ” In the meantime, Reale had heard of two other female employees with the same complaint about the man. Reale skipped her next shift because she was uncomfortable, and the strike started soon after. That was when she heard the man had been fired — she suspects because the strike was going to “put pressure” on the company about the incident. Contacted Sunday, Canadian Niagara Hotels spokeswoman Sarah Vazquez verified “the employee no longer works at the Rainforest Cafe,” but would not discuss details of the incidents. “Due to employee privacy concerns we do not comment on individual employee matters.” Reale called her mother being banned from all Canadian Niagara Hotels properties “a joke.” “All the PR they put out to try to make themselves look better just makes them look worse,” Reale said. “Sending her that letter, that’s just their way of getting at me.” Morgenweg, who joined striking workers for a rally Saturday in front of the Clifton Hill restaurant, is taking the ban in stride: She didn’t intend to frequent any of the properties anyway. She’s more concerned about her daughter feeling safe at work. “She’s 24, she can make her own decisions, but you know what? As a mom it doesn’t matter if she’s 55 because my mom still worries about me.” SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Star More from The Star & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

We believe the province’s plan, announced last Thursday, is a good start. It is a complicated and ambitious endeavor, and a great deal of work has gone into the document. However, some crucial issues remain unresolved. While the Education Ministry wisely relied on the comprehensive report led by The Hospital for Sick Children, it is now time to consult our frontline pediatricians. After all, if children show signs of COVID-19, we are the health care professionals in the community who parents call first. As frontline community pediatricians, we directly see the impact of children being out of the classroom. Our patients display greater anxiety, more behavioral problems, and increased medical issues such as weight gain. The damage is aggravated for those with special needs, or who come from marginalized communities. We see parents with elevated stress levels as they struggle to cope. They now face further stresses as they decide whether it is safe to send their children back to school. We know the measures that are effective in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, because they have worked in other countries like Denmark. We hope Ontario follows similar protocols. It appears the ministry is appropriately enacting strict screening procedures to prevent symptomatic individuals from entering school, and providing funding for rapid, effective testing and contact tracing when potential infections appear. We agree with the requirement for face masks, with exemptions for younger children, and we trust that frequent hand washing will be demanded. Some questions remain. Will elementary schools be able to provide sufficient physical distancing? We know from our local schools that classes of 23 students or more are common. It may be difficult if not impossible to maintain a bubble of one metre. What about cramped, poorly ventilated portables? It would also be helpful to hear more details on the use of outdoor classrooms when weather permits. We have been fortunate to date in not seeing large numbers of Ontario children infected, but this is a new virus and our knowledge remains preliminary. Yes, there is evidence that younger children are less likely to become sick or spread the disease, but we should take note of a recent study from South Korea which indicated that those over the age of 10 can spread the coronavirus as much as adults — all the more reason to be concerned about class sizes for elementary school students in that age range. We are not experts in educational funding, but we feel it is imperative that schools receive all the resources they need in a timely manner. Half measures could be disastrous. As Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization has said, the most important prerequisite for opening schools is to suppress the virus. The numbers in Ontario are encouraging, but in a vast province like ours, the rate of community spread has varied from community to community, so the same standards should not be imposed everywhere. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... We must be alert, nimble, and flexible. If there is an outbreak somewhere, as is likely, we must act quickly and decisively to isolate the infected and adjust the teaching model in the affected community. The urgent task of safely returning two million Ontario students to their classrooms must be a partnership. Pediatricians have always played a central role in children’s wellbeing. As proud representatives of community pediatricians in the province, the Pediatricians Alliance of Ontario stands ready to advise and collaborate with parents, the province, educators, and public health policy makers. Dr. Sharon Burey is the President of the Pediatricians Alliance of Ontario. Dr. Malini Dave is the Vice-President.

I have confidence in our health table, and yes, do I push them? One hundred per cent I push them, but I’m not a medical professional. I rely on them to move things forward.” — Ontario Premier Doug Ford, under fire for a slow response to COVID in long-term-care homes, April 22. As the pandemic has progressed in Ontario, Doug Ford has made a show of deferring to his medical advisers, and two above all. Dr. David Williams, the much-criticized chief medical officer of health, and the health command table. Those are far from his only medical advisers; they are, however, the ones he mentions most. And as mistakes have been made, including when the province announced on Friday of last week that Toronto, Peel and Ottawa would be placed back in a modified Stage 2, weeks after outside experts had raised the alarm, the obvious question has been, who gave the premier his advice? Who was he listening to? Last week, Ford showed an alarming lack of understanding of how epidemics work; three days earlier the premier said Ontario was flattening the curve. Who was telling him this? Who is messing this up? It has been hard to tell, because of the opaque nature of the decision-making. Ford loves to mention his health command table, but the province refuses to name the participants, and Ford has, too, when asked. Unlike the public health advice in all 34 public health units in the province, no provincial-level public health advice — from Public Health Ontario, the health table, the health measures table, or the other advisory tables that feed into the health table — is ever made public. Which means the health table acquired a sort of mythic quality. But while the premier might cite it as a reason to do or not do things, multiple sources insist it is not pulling the strings, or pushing things forward. It is primarily made up of government officials from a wide range of ministries and sources, and a few outside advisers. “It’s not decision-making,” says Dr. Thomas Stewart, the CEO of St. Joseph’s Health System, and a member of the health command table. “It’s advisory. Why does there need to be multiple ministries there? They need to weigh in from their perspective. There’s everything involved, so they need to be able to stick up for how this might hit them.” “I think when you look at all the tables, and how it structures out, and the cross-ministry collaboration, which I’ve never seen before, you would be impressed at how many people weigh in, experts in a variety of areas weigh in,” says Stewart. “And it’s not for me to even comment on whether it should be public or not. What do I care? Maybe people would feel more confident knowing.” The Star has seen a list of the table, and has confirmed several of the participants with other sources. It is publicly acknowledged that deputy minister of health Helen Angus and Ontario Health head Matt Anderson are co-chairs, along with Williams, though sources say Williams rarely, if ever, leads the proceedings. Dr. Dirk Huyer, the coroner and outbreak response co-ordinator, has sat in more recently. Government officials are mostly from the Ministry of Health and Ontario Health (the relatively new super-agency that’s in charge of testing), but also from a wide number of other ministries, and of course the Premier’s Office and the cabinet. Consultants from KPMG are included, though sources indicated they are pulling back from their role. Public Health Ontario is represented, and this includes head of microbiology Dr. Vanessa Allen, who has been identified by the premier; she is believed to be the only member of the health table with a significant background in infectious diseases. And the actual outside medical advisers are few. Dr. Kevin Smith and Shiran Isaackz are the top two executives from University Health Network, which runs the biggest hospitals in Canada, though Isaackz has apparently been attending less of late. Stewart is the head of St. Joseph’s Health System. And Jennifer Gibson is the director of the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics. Stewart would not go into details about how the process works, but other sources added more details. The health table can raise issues, but more often it is a sounding board before an issue goes off into policy-making. It’s not even necessarily a question of whether the province follows health table advice: it’s that health table advice is sometimes internally aligned and sometimes not, and whatever it says is only one step before the issue gets put into the policy hopper. One source familiar with the process says the table primarily gets recommendations from the ministry, and discusses them, but “you can’t really have a decision-making body with 80 people on a phone call when you don’t know who’s there.” “It certainly is a forum that is open to opinion, not that everyone shares the same opinion,” says Stewart. “I’m there gratis, and have been asked to give my opinion, having lived through SARS and other things. So no one prevents us from saying everything we believe, but whether all the time that gets executed is a different story. Because as you can imagine, this is complex business.” RELATED STORIES Provincial Politics Civil rights watchdog accuses Ford government of pandemic power grab ‘by stealth’ Oct. 13, 2020 Provincial Politics Ontario electricity prices to rise almost 2% Oct. 13, 2020 ContributorsOpinion Seven days that demand answers: Why did the province dawdle on city’s request to close bars and restaurants?

Steini Brown, dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, and Dr. Peter Juni, a well-regarded epidemiologist and researcher from the University of Toronto at St. Michael’s Hospital, lead presentations from the science table. Dr. David Price, the chair of McMaster’s Department of Family Medicine, leads the primary care table. Other tables can report in as well, from health measures to testing to PPE to modelling. But the decision on moving Toronto, Peel and Ottawa back into Stage 2 last week was driven more by the health measures table, which consists of seven current and former medical officers of health. One source familiar with the process was asked who is really directing Ontario’s epidemic response. They said: “Doug Ford.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... So without any public recommendations, knowing who is giving some of the advice is only one piece of the puzzle. Tuesday, Williams expressed an odd faith in Ontario’s daily case counts, saying he was encouraged by a drop from a high last Friday. But seven-day averages are a more reliable gauge, and it seemed clear testing changes in the past week or so made the data a little muddy. And of a possible post-Thanksgiving increase in transmission, Williams deferred to local public health officials, and said, “I want to see how it goes.” Maybe the worst advice the premier gets has been hiding in plain sight.

In a statement Sunday, O’Toole asserted his own views on such issues as abortion, gay rights and reconciliation with Indigenous people in Canada while insisting that his party is not beholden to right-wing extremists and hatemongers. “The Conservatives are a moderate, pragmatic, mainstream party — as old as Confederation — that sits squarely in the centre of Canadian politics,” O’Toole said. “My singular focus is to get Canada’s economy back on track as quickly as possible to create jobs and secure a strong future for all Canadians. There is no place for the far right in our party.” The unusual statement follows the riot on Capitol Hill, which U.S. President Donald Trump has been accused of inciting and which has since been held up as proof of the dangers posed by right-wing extremists to Western democracy. It also comes on the heels of a Liberal Party fundraising letter sent to members last week that accused the Conservatives under O’Toole of “continuing a worrisome pattern of divisive politics and catering to the extreme right.” As one example, it cited the motto used by O’Toole’s leadership campaign: “Take back Canada.” It also referenced a photo that has been circulating of Conservative deputy leader Candice Bergen wearing a hat with Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and a since-deleted Tory website alleging the Liberals want to rig the next election. O’Toole on Sunday condemned the Capitol Hill attack as “horrifying,” and sought to distance himself and the Tories from Trumpism by touting his party’s support for free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power and accountable government. To that end, he lashed out at the Liberals, referencing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to prorogue Parliament last summer as hurting accountability, before turning the tables on the governing party and accusing them of using U.S.-style politics. “If the Liberals want to label me as ‘far right,’ they are welcome to try,” O’Toole said. “Canadians are smart and they will see this as an attempt to mislead people and import some of the fear and division we have witnessed in the United States.” Former Conservative strategist Tim Powers, who is now chairman of Summa Strategies, believes O’Toole’s team saw a “gathering storm” and felt the need to act to prevent the Liberals from painting the Conservatives as beholden to Trumpism. Such action was especially important ahead of what could be an extremely divisive week down in the U.S., where there are fears that Trump supporters and far-right actors will respond to Joe Biden’s inauguration as president with violence. Powers suggested it is also the latest act in O’Toole’s effort to introduce himself to Canadians and redefine the Conservatives ahead of the next federal election, both of which have been made more difficult by COVID-19. And when Conservatives in caucus make statements or otherwise act counter to his stated positions, Powers said O’Toole will need to “crush them and take them out” to prove his convictions. Shuvaloy Majumdar, who served as a policy director in Stephen Harper’s government, welcomed O’Toole’s statement while also speaking of the threat that events in the U.S. could pose to the Tories in Canada — particularly if the Liberals try to link them. O’Toole was accused during last year’s Conservative leadership race of courting social conservatives who oppose abortion, among other issues. That raises questions about the degree to which he may anger the party’s base by taking more progressive positions. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... But Majumdar suggested many of the populist elements left the Tories for Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada and that O’Toole is seeking to appeal to more voters by taking a broader view on social issues while sticking to the party’s core economic positions. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 17, 2021. Note to readers: This is a corrected story. An earlier version misquoted Shuvaloy Majumdar saying many social conservatives had left for the People’s Party of Canada. He actually said many of the populist elements had left.

By Alex BoydCalgary Bureau Thu., Jan. 21, 2021timer6 min. read Delayed vaccine deliveries have dialed up the pressure on health authorities facing tough decisions about how to deploy the doses they have. Upgrades to a Pfizer factory in Belgium mean there will be no vaccine deliveries to Canada next week, and overall shipments will be cut in half for about a month, prompting multiple provinces to stretch out supply with a controversial idea: increasing the amount of time before people get their second shot. It’s a tactic that Israel, one of the nations that has been cited as a leader in vaccine efficiency, is also now casting doubt on. Pfizer itself recommends that the two doses of its vaccine needed to achieve its full benefit be given 21 days apart. That’s also the treatment plan that Health Canada has authorized, though the provinces have the right to adjust protocols under what’s called off-label use. Pfizer has said a single dose provides about 52 per cent protection, compared to about 95 per cent after two shots. The argument being made by some jurisdictions — including Ontario — is that it’s better to give more people the limited protection a single dose appears to deliver and they can still get their second shot, just a little later. The downside is that there are major questions about how well one dose works — including how long any protection would last. Ontario is now planning to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to 42 days for people not connected to long-term-care facilities, chief medical officer Dr. David Williams said over the weekend. Meanwhile, B.C. had previously changed its schedule to 35 days and Quebec announced plans to allow up to a 90-day delay. “To me, the rationale for saying we should be flexible with the second dose was when the provinces were taking delivery of the vaccines and they were basically earmarking two doses for one person,” says Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease expert at the University of Alberta. “We were having long-term-care outbreaks going on, but we had vaccine in the freezer.” Whether to delay has been a fiery debate around the globe, with proponents on both sides arguing they’re just trying to save lives. The United Kingdom made headlines around the world in early January when it decided to delay second doses by 12 weeks in the face of spiking cases and a new, highly transmissible variant. But according to the Guardian this week, Israeli officials now say they’ve found just one dose to be less effective than promised, further raising the question of how valuable a single shot of the vaccine is. Here in Canada, one of the experts who helped advise the federal government on which vaccines to buy warns that deviating from recommended use is a choice that could come with consequences. “I completely understand the motivation behind wanting to space the two doses as far as possible, because there’s a natural desire to vaccinate as many people as possible with at least one dose, especially when the vaccine supply is in short supply,” says Alan Bernstein, who is also the president and CEO of CIFAR, a Canadian global research organization. “We shouldn’t be tempted, though, by a half-baked solution. We should be governed by science.” In a recent national op-ed, Bernstein and two other members of the national COVID-19 vaccine task force argued that deviating from dosing recommendations risks undermining trust in the safety of very new vaccines and might even be considered experimental — which is something to which recipients did not agree. While Bernstein notes there’s “nothing magical” about 21 days — and in fact, we might learn later that waiting is totally fine — current protocols are based on what was tested on thousands of volunteers during clinical trials, and any other approach is just guessing right now. “I think we might be kind of kidding ourselves that by giving one dose we’re protecting more people when, in fact, those people are not protected, especially the people who are the most vulnerable in our society,” he said. “So I think we have to tread pretty carefully and go by the data.” The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued new recommendations last week stressing that every effort should be made to follow dosing schedules, but that exemptions might make sense in certain circumstances. Still, the recommendations acknowledge the ethical grey area. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Giving out all of the doses as first shots “may provide greater access to a greater number of individuals providing at least some short-term protection, which could increase equity when local disease burden is high,” the advice reads. “However, health equity principles may be undermined if protection is not adequate and subsequent supply is insufficient, putting key populations at high risk of infection and disease.” In an ideal world, we’d have a consistent vaccine supply and would always use it in the recommended way, but as a pandemic rages, sometimes you need to be willing to try to protect more people sooner, Saxinger says. “I think that the urgency to gamble is directly related to your vaccine supply and how severe your problem is,” she said, pointing to the United Kingdom’s decision. “A flexible second dose can save lives. And I think that the risks are theoretic and the life-saving is not theoretical.” It’s possible to piece together signs that this approach works, Saxinger argues. There is evidence that the first dose does provide some protection and, based on the fact that natural immunity seems to last for a while, she adds it’s “very plausible” that the protection afforded by that first dose might have some runway, too. She adds that there is limited data from the trials on people who waited 42 days between shots — “they had people kind of coming in late for their dose because life happens,” as she puts it — who were still protected. The point of that second dose is to make your immune response last longer, so it’s important that people get it eventually, she adds. But she sees the argument for delaying it in circumstances where it means other, more vulnerable people can be protected instead. Bernstein said he’s OK with the window being expanded to 42 days in extreme circumstances, but not for seniors and other people who are particularly vulnerable. “They’re the ones who are dying the highest rates; they’re the ones who are most vulnerable … Why wouldn’t we give them the best, optimal chance based on science and data?” He remains critical of extending any longer or any approach that hasn’t been battle-tested by large-scale human trials — the process through which each vaccine was tested on thousands of people around the world before being vetted by Health Canada. “Anything else is speculation based on other vaccines, other viruses, preliminary data, early data, antibody data after the first dose, but none of it has the thoroughness and the statistical validity of the phase three trials,” he said. He points out that shipments are slated to scale back up in February and federal officials say they’ll be increased to compensate for the current delay. “I’m not convinced all the provinces have the setup ready for such a huge influx of vaccine to vaccinate as many people as possible as fast as possible,” he said. “So let’s use this time to get ready.” Alex Boyd is a Calgary-based reporter for the Star.

This glossary provides definitions for the various types of news and opinion content and, following that, for the various forms of paid content published online and in the newspaper. Drawing a clear line between news and opinion has long been one of the Toronto Star's core values. Broadly defined, news is based on the impartial reporting of facts while opinion is based on personal interpretation and the judgement of facts. NEWS News content is verified information based on the impartial reporting of facts, either observed by the reporter or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. News reports do not include the opinion of the author. NEWS TERMS Analysis: A critical or contextual examination of an important and topical issue based on factual reporting. It provides an explanation of the impact or meaning of news events and draws on the authority and expertise of the writer. Analysis articles do not contain the author’s opinions. Investigation: In-depth reporting in the public interest that reveals wrongdoing and/or systemic problems that holds those in power accountable and promotes positive change. Explainer: Journalism that provides readers with the background knowledge they need to help them understand the how and why of events or issues. Fact Check: A form of accountability journalism where reporters test the veracity of statements and/or assertions using a variety of credible, authoritative sources to root out disinformation. OPINION Opinion articles are based on personal interpretation and judgment of facts. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views, subject to standards of taste and laws of libel including views directly contrary to the editorial views of the Star. OPINION TERMS Editorial: An article that presents a point of view reflecting the news organization's position on an issue of public interest. Editorials are not meant to be a neutral presentation of the facts. They are written by journalists who are expressing the view of the news organization. As an editorial serves to present the company’s voice, there is no individual byline. Opinion: Articles based on the author’s interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events. Opinion articles include columns written by staff and commentary from non-staff contributors. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views including views directly contrary to the news organization's editorial views, as long as they fall within the boundaries of taste and laws of libel. Advice: An advice article reflects the opinion of the author who provides guidance or direction on a topic based on their expertise as well as their personal interpretations and judgments of facts. Blog: An online journal updated regularly by a journalist or editorial department that supplements news coverage. Blogs are usually informal or conversational in style and may reflect a writer’s opinions, subject to the rights and responsibilities of fair comment. First Person: Narratives exploring an author’s insights, observations or thoughts based on that individual’s personal experience and opinions. Readers’ letters: A selection of letters written to the Star by readers expressing a point of view, usually concerning a recently published article or current event. Review: A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion. The Star is committed to the principle that our audiences should not be confused about the distinction between our journalism – news and editorial content – and our advertising and other paid content. All paid content is clearly labelled with one of the following: Supported: Produced with financial support from an organization or individual, yet not approved by the underwriter before publication. Articles are held to strict journalistic standards but are funded by entities interested in being associated with or expanding attention to a particular topic. Sponsored: Produced on behalf of an organization or individual that has paid the news provider for production and/or approved publication. It does not meet the standards of impartial or independent journalism because a sponsor has been involved in production or review before publication. Advertisment: Supplied by an organization or individual that has paid the news provider for its placement. As a result, while it may be written in the style of the publication, it is not impartial journalism.

And Dr. Vera Etches, in Ottawa. And Dr. Lawrence Loh, in Peel Region. They contacted colleagues in other populous areas, like Dr. Wajid Ahmed, in Windsor-Essex. The medical officers of health in this province speak frequently, compare notes, and lean on one another, especially in a pandemic. And they have recognized there was something Ontario didn’t have, but needed. “We felt that there were a lot of decisions being made which are based on the popular opinion, rather than actual evidence-based,” says Ahmed. “I felt it, I communicated it with some of my colleagues, and some of my colleagues also agreed that it’s about time we go back to what we normally do, in terms of our expertise and taking control of our issues, which is important. We should be the ones to make some of those decisions to protect the community.” Later this week Ontario’s medical officers of health will announce a set of specific data-based thresholds signed off by all 34 medical officers of health in the province. It will provide real benchmarks that medical officers of health can use if they feel the need to slow things down. It is speed limits, and a steering wheel. You see, Ontario didn’t do that. When it set out its plan for reopening the province, there were few if any actual numbers attached. On April 30, Ontario chief medical officer Dr. David Williams said he wanted to see daily cases go down “well below 200 (daily new community cases), to get us back to where we were in the early part of March.” There was talk of a two- to four-week decline in daily cases. None of that had happened when Premier Doug Ford announced the resumption of curbside pickup for retail a week later, over Toronto Mayor John Tory and de Villa’s evident discomfort. “I think we recognize that there were challenges in the provincial framework, because there weren’t any measures that you could hang your hat on for some of the metrics that were identified,” says Loh. “They identified a decrease in this, or a decrease in this, but even then it wasn’t clear what was the specific metric in some thresholds that you might use in your judgment.” A week and a cabinet meeting later, Ford lurched forward again, announcing a wide reopening of select businesses, including non-mall retail shops. Places like Germany laid out specific scientific thresholds for different phases of reopening. In Ontario, there were no specific numbers cited. “I was a little surprised at the way the announcements were coming,” said Loh, whose region encompasses Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon. “I mean, each individual thing seemed pretty innocuous: outdoor activities, garden centres, retail, curbside pickup, marinas, golf courses, those kind of things. “But the thing that I was concerned about is we’re a populous region, just like Toronto. And opening up retail opens up a very large segment of the community, and a great number of people who then start circulating around the community. They’re back at work, back in coffee shops, back around. “And when you open things, it sends a message to the community as a whole: it sends a message that oh, things are getting back to normal, when in reality that was not the case that we were seeing in Peel: our case counts had stabilized but we had not seen a decline, and certainly not two to four weeks of decline that was specified in the province’s own framework.” And almost two weeks after reopening, the province has seen a significant uptick in cases over the past week that don’t reflect any reopening changes due to the delay in symptom onset, even as testing numbers collapsed to nearly half of capacity. The premier promised a new plan will be unveiled this week. And that’s before you get to the confusion in communication. The medical officers did not reveal the specific thresholds in the plan, but it puts identifiable numbers on four pillars: a seven-day average of new cases to measure how the disease is spreading; an assessment of available ICU and hospital capacity; and adequate levels of testing and contact tracing, neither of which have been well established in most of Ontario. “One of the difficulties with what we’re seeing in the data now is that the resurgence in the GTA may have contaminated elsewhere in the province,” says Dr. David Fisman, an epidemiologist from the University of Toronto. “And you have a raging fire in one place, you don’t want people moving from wherever the raging fire to the calm place, because that’s how epidemics spread. Unfortunately, when MOHs have taken action like that, they’ve been undermined.” “I think it’s a big province, places are far apart, there’s a lot of success stories in Ontario, and then there’s a lot of challenges in the GTA that are less so outside the GTA. So I think it’s a terrific idea.” Dr. Chuck Gardner of Simcoe-Muskoka has already presented the plan to the province’s health table, but however the province reacts — and it should grab a chance for a win-win with populous regions, and climb down from a one-size-fits-all strategy that defaults to the parts of the province with the fewest cases — the medical officers of health are determined to use it going forward. They frame it as an addition, to support Williams and inform the discussion. “If the province comes out and says everything is now open, and we as medical officers of health say that doesn’t seem right, I think there’s a huge risk in my community, I don’t want us to open — basically the legislation allows me in my jurisdiction, in my area to say we’re not opening,” said Ahmed. “I know that doesn’t happen that frequently, but it does.” RELATED STORIES GTA Why it’s so hard to ramp up Ontario’s COVID-19 testing.

I cannot do that. But I can be more restrictive in nature.” Speed limits. It’s not a public health coup, precisely, or a revolt. It is, however, an attempt to regionalize policy in a province with vast differences, which the premier and the chief medical officer of health have refused to do. “It gives us something to hold on to,” says Dr. Ahmed.

Wow.’ Ontario’s public health units are acting to protect their regions — and the province has to listen By Bruce ArthurColumnist Thu., May 28, 2020timer5 min. read The province has to embrace this, and fix this. On Wednesday, Ontario’s 34 public health units, in the face of an inflexible approach and insufficient leadership amid a pandemic, decided to take some control for themselves. “It’s a mutiny,” says Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto, and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network. “They’re actually outlining a strategy. That’s pretty amazing. That’s unbelievable. It’s a mutiny. Wow. “I’m going to say great for them, like about bloody time. The real issue is going to be whether the province agrees to this or not.” A document, which was prepared by the medical officers of health and obtained by the Star, lays out several specific categories that should be considered together before different parts of Ontario reopen businesses or organizations, or decide to reinstitute restrictions. Note: On desktop, use ""+"" and ""-"" to navigate this document. On mobile, pinch to zoom On virus containment it spells out a two- to four-week decline in new daily cases, a decrease in unsourced cases, a decrease in hospital admissions; a seven-day decline in community cases; and more. It also lays out indicators in health-care capacity, public health system capacity, and incidence tracking capacity. And it explains why. All 34 medical officers of health signed it, and as much as they tried to present the plan as a complement to the provincial reopening plan, the provincial version was considered maddeningly light on actual data thresholds. This is polite, firm mutiny in the name of the public’s health. Some had already considered something similar. “As public health practitioners we’re obliged to follow the data, and do what makes sense to best protect the health of the populations that we serve,” said Toronto’s Dr. Eileen de Villa, who spearheaded the effort with Ottawa’s Dr. Vera Etches and Peel Region’s Dr. Lawrence Loh. The plan’s exact numbers haven’t all been established. Dr. Irfan Dhalla, the vice-president of St. Michael’s Hospital, said it may expose gaps in the data we have. Dr. David Fisman of the University of Toronto called it right and coherent. Morris called it wise. Dhalla said it just made sense. “Today feels like a win, and I haven’t felt that in about 10 days,” says epidemiologist Dr. Nitin Mohan, who teaches public and global health at Western University, and who co-founded a public health consulting firm called ETIO. “This is exactly what we’re looking for. This is a very logical document, and they do really well to say, here are the minimum requirements, and here are our suggestions to go further. I’m really impressed. “I don’t want to play Monday morning quarterback and look back, but had we had these parameters from the beginning we probably could have hit a sustainable opening by now, and we could be talking about a Phase 2 opening.” The province started reopening some businesses in Phase 1 without having met concrete benchmarks, and it neither embraced nor rejected the document. Health Minister Christine Elliott said the province was listening, and said the document would go to the expansive Ontario health command table. Premier Doug Ford argued Wednesday people might travel among regions. “I always say, we need to stick together as a province, and I think we’re moving along pretty well,” said Ford. “Everyone’s listening, everyone’s following the protocol of their local medical officer of health, people are still self-distancing, we’re ramping up testing, and thank goodness, you saw the numbers, I know they’re up and down like a yo-yo, but last two days have been positive, under 300 (new cases). So there’s positive things that are happening. “So why make a big divide now, when we’re getting through this?” The point is that the province’s medical officers of health have powers to make their own decisions, and do not necessarily think we are all doing very well. And epidemiologists agree. “I’ve been aware of at least three (medical groups drafting letters), outside the medical officers for health, saying we’re better than this, we can do better, we’re going in the wrong direction,” says Fisman. “And the most productive ones don’t just say fire the chief medical officer of health. They say, here’s what a different way would look like, and who are some of the people who have that skill set and experience to actually lead that effort and turn this flaming dumpster-fire clown car around?” Dr. David Williams’s job as Ontario’s chief medical officer of health has been a topic of discussion in medical circles for some time. Williams, for his part, said he considered the plan a complement to his existing framework. He said, “I saw it as much more of a positive thing … My overall approach, I think it’s a good thing they’re doing, and they’re keeping me informed.” That may be a good thing. “What should have happened is David Williams, along with Public Health Ontario, should have brought together the medical officers of health and said guys, what should we do?” says Morris. “And they would come up with this document and everyone would be on the same page and it would work perfectly. Instead, for a variety of reasons, they have taken it upon themselves to outline a strategy that is in my mind really thoughtful. “But is this going to advance the cause? I don’t know, because people might be really confused. What happens if the premier says one thing, and all these medical officers of health say something different?

Because he should be aligned with these guys, but he’s employed by the premier. It’s unclear if the premier needs to go along with any of this. Morris says he figures the only quick fix is to appoint somebody to quarterback all this, with diplomacy and communication skills and administrative ability. “If you consider a pandemic to be a health-care equivalent of a war, you actually do need a command-and-control structure,” says Dr. Sacha Bhatia, the chief innovation officer at Women’s College Hospital, and its chief of cardiology. “You have to be a competent general to run it. Bonnie Henry in B.C. — even the premier deferred to this one person. “I think at the end of the day, a very strong CMOH makes a lot of these problems go away.” The province needs to embrace this, and fix this.

A new survey shows that more and more Canadians see telecommuting as a permanent option, and that means fewer customers for coffee shops, lunch spots, pubs and more in urban centres. This will contribute to $20 billion in lost revenue in the upcoming year for the industry hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the report predicts. Almost 11,000 Canadians were surveyed about working from home and food expenses at the end of July by the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, in partnership with research firm Caddle. Almost a quarter of the respondents, or 23.6 per cent, said they plan to work from home more often a year from now, while another 40 per cent either said they didn’t know, or they don’t know what they will be doing a year from now. Quebec had the highest percentage of respondents saying they plan to work from home more often a year from now, at 28.9 per cent, while Ontario came second at 24.8 per cent. As well, millennials (born 1981-1996) had the highest percentage of any demographic, at 25.3 per cent. Of those who plan to work from home more often, 57 per cent plan to spend less at restaurants because of it. Before the pandemic, 36.8 per cent of the survey’s respondents were going to a restaurant for a meal or a break at least twice a week. When the pandemic ends, only 23.3 per cent of respondents plan to continue this — a significant drop, said Sylvain Charlebois, the lead author and Dalhousie professor in food distribution and policy. “That’s becoming more and more of a legitimate option for a greater number of employers and actually will have a huge impact on the food industry and its architecture,” he said. Close to 22 per cent of respondents said their employers are planning to allow people to work from home more often, and of those respondents, more than half intend to work from home permanently, with some considering relocating because of it. The majority of these — 70.1 per cent — plan to spend much less time and money at restaurants. Charlebois said the impact of more Canadians permanently working from home and potentially moving outside of urban centres will be significant on the food industry, especially on restaurants in urban cores that once relied on commuting workers. According to an analysis of Statistics Canada data in the report, before the pandemic, the ratio in sales between food retail (such as grocery stores) and food service was around 59/41 per cent. But in May, that ratio was closer to 91/9 per cent. Though monthly food retail sales didn’t change much, going from around $7.7 billion monthly pre-pandemic to $7.8 billion in May, monthly food service sales went from $5.3 billion monthly pre-pandemic to $891 million in May, according to the report’s analysis based on Statistics Canada. Of course, that’s after the early pandemic spikes which saw food retail sales jump thanks to Canadians hoarding toilet paper, flour and more. Charlebois said now that grocery store hoarding has settled, Canadians aren’t necessarily spending much more at the grocery store than they were before — dollars spent at a restaurant aren’t equal to dollars spent on groceries, he explained, and Canadians are just generally spending less on food. “What we’re showing is that the pie has shrunk.” As well, Charlebois thinks people may be wasting food less by cooking at home. The report estimates the ratio of food retail sales to food service sales will be around 70/30 by July 2021, which would represent a loss of around $20 billion to the food service industry within the next 12 months — and approximately 30 per cent of that loss will be because of telecommuting, the report suggests. David Lefebvre, vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said the report’s predictions feel conservative based on what his organization is hearing. After all, it’s a snapshot, he said, and the fact that 40 per cent of respondents don’t know where they’ll be working in a year indicates that the number of people who plan on working from home permanently will likely continue to rise. “We feel that as the situation unfolds, you will have more people working from home for a longer period of time,” he said.

Charlebois said he thinks restaurants in urban cores, especially coffee shops and lunch spots, will be hardest-hit — he said people will continue to go to restaurants, but less often and for different reasons. “The pandemic is clearly transformational,” said Charlebois. “I think it’s going to change many economic sectors, including food service.” Lefebvre said restaurants in the urban cores will overall be disproportionately affected, but especially sit-in restaurants that don’t offer delivery or takeout. As well, coffee shops and pubs where people gather after work will be greatly affected, he said. Rosa Saba is a Calgary-based reporter for the Star.

The risks of COVID-19 outbreaks are too great to let down the guard on pandemic precautions, Ford said Thursday as the number of active cases reached its highest level in three weeks and hospitalizations for the virus continued to creep upward. He pointed to the crowded parties seen in television news clips from several U.S. university towns, where cases have skyrocketed in residences and forced some to close in a country where the novel coronavirus is running rampant. “I’m just going to speak to the young people: Guys, just don’t go out there. No parties,” Ford told a news conference in Brockville. “Later on, when we all get through this, you can party after. Just hang in there. Because what’s gonna happen is ... God forbid, someone gets COVID and you’re at these big parties. I’ve seen them. I had four girls. I dropped them off at university.” While colleges and universities are taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus — such as staggered move-in dates for residences, no sharing of rooms, virtual frosh week festivities, takeout food from cafeterias and blocking off space for students who need to self-isolate — Ford said students will play the most important role. The Ministry of Health reported another 118 cases of the virus across the province Thursday, up 34 per cent from 88 the previous day, raising the number of Ontarians with active infections to 1,070. That’s the highest since Aug. 7 and well above a low of 891 early this month. Most new cases are in people under the age of 40, with 47 of the 118 new infections in the 20 to 39 age group and 33 being 19 or younger, mostly in their late teens, said chief medical officer Dr. David Williams. The new infections remain concentrated in Toronto with 36, 19 in Peel, and Ottawa with 22, while Windsor-Essex increased jumped to 12 and Durham had 10. Health Minister Christine Elliott said most areas of the province remain in good shape as the province continues in Stage 3 of reopenings. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with 18 reporting no new cases,” she wrote on Twitter. Although Ontario is struggling to keep new daily infections below 100 most days, ending a streak enjoyed earlier this month, Williams said he is not overly concerned but is keeping a close watch. “I want it below 150,” he said. Should numbers jump up once students return to school, Williams said the province is prepared to consider local or regional restrictions aimed a specific outbreaks — such as ordering closures of businesses or schools with large clusters of infection — instead of a broader lockdown as seen in the winter and spring. “It doesn’t take a lot to rack up 150 to 200 cases in a large place with 10,000 people,” he added. Peel has the highest number of active cases of COVID-19 with 254, followed by Toronto with 243 and Ottawa with 177 — all increases from Wednesday. Ministry of Health statistics are based on information submitted by health units at 4 p.m. the previous day. The number of people requiring hospital care for COVID-19 across Ontario increased by five to 48, the highest since Aug. 12, with the 18 needing intensive care up by three. Ten of the ICU patients are on ventilators, unchanged from Wednesday. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Hospitalizations remain well within the health system’s capacity, but have been climbing with the increased number of active cases. A Star compilation of data from health units at 5 p.m. Thursday found 147 new confirmed and probable cases in the previous 24 hours, for a total of 43,943 since last January. There have been 2,839 deaths. Labs across Ontario processed 28,625 tests on Wednesday. Rob Ferguson is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics for the Star.

The risks of COVID-19 outbreaks are too great to let down the guard on pandemic precautions, Ford said Thursday as the number of active cases reached its highest level in three weeks and hospitalizations for the virus continued to creep upward. He pointed to the crowded parties seen in television news clips from several U.S. university towns, where cases have skyrocketed in residences and forced some to close in a country where the novel coronavirus is running rampant. “I’m just going to speak to the young people: Guys, just don’t go out there. No parties,” Ford told a news conference in Brockville. “Later on, when we all get through this, you can party after. Just hang in there. Because what’s gonna happen is ... God forbid, someone gets COVID and you’re at these big parties. I’ve seen them. I had four girls. I dropped them off at university.” While colleges and universities are taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus — such as staggered move-in dates for residences, no sharing of rooms, virtual frosh week festivities, takeout food from cafeterias and blocking off space for students who need to self-isolate — Ford said students will play the most important role. The Ministry of Health reported another 118 cases of the virus across the province Thursday, up 34 per cent from 88 the previous day, raising the number of Ontarians with active infections to 1,070. That’s the highest since Aug. 7 and well above a low of 891 early this month. Most new cases are in people under the age of 40, with 47 of the 118 new infections in the 20 to 39 age group and 33 being 19 or younger, mostly in their late teens, said chief medical officer Dr. David Williams. The new infections remain concentrated in Toronto with 36, 19 in Peel, and Ottawa with 22, while Windsor-Essex increased jumped to 12 and Durham had 10. Health Minister Christine Elliott said most areas of the province remain in good shape as the province continues in Stage 3 of reopenings. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with 18 reporting no new cases,” she wrote on Twitter. Although Ontario is struggling to keep new daily infections below 100 most days, ending a streak enjoyed earlier this month, Williams said he is not overly concerned but is keeping a close watch. “I want it below 150,” he said. Should numbers jump up once students return to school, Williams said the province is prepared to consider local or regional restrictions aimed a specific outbreaks — such as ordering closures of businesses or schools with large clusters of infection — instead of a broader lockdown as seen in the winter and spring. “It doesn’t take a lot to rack up 150 to 200 cases in a large place with 10,000 people,” he added. Peel has the highest number of active cases of COVID-19 with 254, followed by Toronto with 243 and Ottawa with 177 — all increases from Wednesday. Ministry of Health statistics are based on information submitted by health units at 4 p.m. the previous day. The number of people requiring hospital care for COVID-19 across Ontario increased by five to 48, the highest since Aug. 12, with the 18 needing intensive care up by three. Ten of the ICU patients are on ventilators, unchanged from Wednesday. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Hospitalizations remain well within the health system’s capacity, but have been climbing with the increased number of active cases. A Star compilation of data from health units at 5 p.m. Thursday found 147 new confirmed and probable cases in the previous 24 hours, for a total of 43,943 since last January. There have been 2,839 deaths. Labs across Ontario processed 28,625 tests on Wednesday. Rob Ferguson is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics for the Star.

Connaught Labs was a superstar in global medicine. For seven decades, this publicly owned Canadian company performed brilliantly on the national and international stage, contributing to medical breakthroughs and developing affordable treatments and vaccines for deadly diseases. Hated by its corporate competitors, Connaught was unique among pharmaceutical companies in that its focus was on human need, not profit. It would have come in handy today. In fact, Connaught got its start amid a diphtheria outbreak in 1913. Toronto doctor John Gerald FitzGerald was outraged that children were dying in large numbers even though there was a diphtheria treatment available from a U.S. manufacturer. But, at $25 a dose, it was unaffordable to all but the rich. FitzGerald set out to change that — and did. After experimenting on a horse in a downtown Toronto stable, FitzGerald developed an antitoxin that proved effective in treating diphtheria, and made it available to public health outlets across the country. Then, with lab space provided by the University of Toronto, he and his team went on to produce low-cost treatments and vaccines for other common killers, including tetanus, typhoid and meningitis. Connaught developed an impressive research capacity, with its scientists contributing to some of the biggest medical breakthroughs of the 20th century — including penicillin and the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines. It also played a central role in the global eradication of smallpox. “It was a pioneer in a lot of ways,” says Colleen Fuller, a research associate of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. “It did things commercial companies wouldn’t do because they weren’t willing to take the financial risks.” Fuller argues that if a publicly owned Connaught were still operating today, it could be contributing to the development of the coronavirus vaccine — and ensuring a Canadian supply if there was a global shortage. Yet, tragically it isn’t. Succumbing to corporate pressure and a misguided belief that the private sector always does things better, Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservative government privatized Connaught Labs in the 1980s. Today, what remains of this once-dazzling Canadian public enterprise has been taken over by a giant French pharmaceutical company. The coronavirus outbreak may finally help expose the fallacy of the notion that the private marketplace is innately superior — which has been the guiding principle in Anglo-American countries (including Canada) for the past four decades, leading to the constant denigration of government and its functions. Fortunately, Canada’s public health care system, established in the 1960s, has been so popular that it has survived, despite attacks of “socialized medicine” — although our political leaders have quietly whittled away funding for the system in recent decades. If the foolishness of cutting funding for public health care wasn’t already abundantly clear, the coronavirus has driven it home with a sledgehammer — as we’ve witnessed the extra struggles the U.S. faces in containing the virus with its lack of public health care. Still, our willingness to go along with the privatization cult in recent decades has left us weaker and less protected than we could be.

(The answer is further than you may think) Feb. 26, 2020 Not only do we no longer have Connaught Labs, but Canada spends $1 billion a year funding basic medical research at Canadian universities, yet relies on the private marketplace to produce, control — and profit from — the resulting medical innovations. For instance, the crucial work in developing a vaccine to treat Ebola was done by Canadian scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg — and financed by Canadian taxpayer money. But sole licensing rights to the vaccine were granted to a small U.S. company, which then sublicensed it to pharmaceutical giant Merck for $50 million. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Although Merck is now producing the vaccine, critics have charged that the company did “next to nothing” to rush the vaccine into production during the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, according to a recent paper published in the Journal of Law and Biosciences. With a surge in future global pandemics expected, it might well be time to rethink Canada’s foolhardy attachment to the notion “the private sector always does things better.” Always unproven, that theory is looking increasingly far-fetched.
